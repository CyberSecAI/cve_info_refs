  "related_cves": [
    "CVE-2010-4698"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the number of anti-aliasing steps passed to the `imagepstext` function within PHP's GD extension. The function expects this parameter to be either 4 or 16, but it does not enforce this check before utilizing the provided value to populate a stack-based array of 16 integers, named `aa`.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the `imagepstext` function of PHP's GD extension. The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the anti-aliasing step parameter before using it to populate an array on the stack."
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to a segmentation fault and possibly allowing for arbitrary code execution. The segmentation fault can cause the PHP process to terminate, affecting the availability of the service.",
  "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves passing a malicious integer value as the number of anti-aliasing steps to the imagepstext function. This value is used to populate an array located on the stack, allowing an attacker to cause a buffer overflow.",
  "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to call the `imagepstext` function with a chosen value for the anti-aliasing steps parameter. This usually involves exploiting a PHP script or application that makes use of the GD library's image processing capabilities."
