Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "REF_URL" parameter in the "admin/index.asp" page of the Member Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or encode user-controlled data before reflecting it back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful XSS attack can allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session. This malicious code executes within the context of the affected website. This can have several impacts such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Executing malicious actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the "REF_URL" parameter in the "admin/index.asp" page. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and send it to a victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a URL with a malicious script payload to a victim who has access to the vulnerable application. The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Member Management System v 4.0 and potentially other versions.
- The provided blog post mentions a solution is to filter malicious characters and sequences through a web proxy.
