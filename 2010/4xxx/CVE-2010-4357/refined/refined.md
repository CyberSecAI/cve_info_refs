Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `comments.php` script of SiteEngine 7.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided through the `id` and `module` parameters in the `comments.php` script, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by crafting specific SQL queries using `UNION SELECT` statements. This includes usernames and password hashes.
*   **Potential Backdoor Upload:** While not directly related to the SQLi, the exploit information mentions a way to upload a backdoor through the administrator panel, by uploading a malicious WAP logo and accessing its properties to retrieve its URL.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `comments.php` file. Specifically, the `id` and `module` parameters are manipulated.
*   **Publicly Accessible Comments:** The exploit depends on comments being enabled (which is the default setting).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL in order to craft the injection payload.
*   **No Authentication Required (SQLi):** The SQL injection is exploitable without needing authentication.
* **Authentication Required (Backdoor):** To upload the backdoor, the attacker requires access to the administrator panel.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit examples provided demonstrates how to retrieve usernames and password hashes from the `boka_members` table, which is a database table used by SiteEngine.
*   Different exploit URLs are provided based on the SiteEngine version being Enterprise Portal or E-commerce version. The main difference between the exploit URLs appears to be the number of columns within the `UNION SELECT` clause.
*   The content also provides a dork for finding potentially vulnerable sites `("Powered by SiteEngine")`
