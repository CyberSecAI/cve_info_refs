Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-4046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of HTML5 canvas elements in the Opera browser. Specifically, the browser fails to properly validate the origin of canvas elements, allowing scripts from one origin to potentially access data from a different origin. This violates the intended security model of web browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Origin Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the ability for scripts from one domain to access pixel data or other information from a canvas element that originated from a different domain. This violates the same-origin policy, a fundamental security principle in web browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could obtain private information from the targeted network resource. This data could include potentially sensitive information that the user would not normally expose to the attacker.
*   **Further Compromise:** While this vulnerability doesn't allow direct code execution or privilege escalation, the attacker could use the stolen information to further compromise the affected system or user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious web page designed to exploit the vulnerability. This page could be hosted by the attacker or inserted into compromised websites or websites hosting user-generated content.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Attackers cannot force users to visit the malicious site. Instead, they must trick users into visiting the malicious page, typically by using deceptive links in emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Resource IP:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the network resource where the private information resides.
*   **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a webpage with malicious javascript code.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick the user into visiting the malicious page.

**Affected Software:**

*   Opera browser versions 10.62 and earlier.

**Mitigation:**

*   Update to Opera version 10.63 or later which fixes the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was discovered by Microsoft Vulnerability Research and was disclosed to Opera Software ASA under coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2010-4046 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list.
*   The advisory from Opera about this issue can be found at [Advisory: Private video streams can be intercepted](https://www.opera.com/support/kb/view/974/).
