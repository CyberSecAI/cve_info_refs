Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-4901

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input passed through the "height" parameter to the `char_map.php` file in MySource Matrix CMS. The unsanitized input is then reflected back to the user within the HTML code.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79). The application fails to properly sanitize user input before reflecting it back to the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or script code into the vulnerable parameter. When a user visits the crafted link, the injected code executes within the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Malicious redirection.
    *   Defacement of the site.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is remote, through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the "height" parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malicious URL. No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `char_map.php`, specifically around lines 182 and 183 which contain commented-out PHP echo statements:
    ```php
    182: // <?php echo $_REQUEST['width'];?>;
    183: // <?php echo $_REQUEST['height'];?>;
    ```
    Although commented out, these lines demonstrate where the unsanitized user input is being reflected.
*   The PoC provided is:
   `http://200.200.200.200/fudge/wysiwyg/plugins/special_chars/char_map.php?width=233%3C/script%3E&height=233%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27zsl%27%29%3C%2fscript%3E`
    This demonstrates how the "height" parameter can be used to inject javascript.

**Affected Software:**

*   MySource Matrix CMS version 3.28.3

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor released patched versions 3.26.8 and 3.28.4.
*   Existing users of the vulnerable version can remove the commented-out lines 182 and 183 from the file `/path/to/matrix/fudge/wysiwyg/plugins/special_chars/char_map.php`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic of Zero Science Lab.
*   The vulnerability is considered a low risk issue with a CVSS base score of 4.3. Although the exploitability is high (8.6), the impact is considered partial (2.9).
