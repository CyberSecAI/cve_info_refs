{
  "CVE-2010-4657": {
    "description": "PHP5 before 5.4.4 allows passing invalid utf-8 strings via the xmlTextWriterWriteAttribute, which are then misparsed by libxml2. This results in memory leak into the resulting output.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from PHP not properly sanitizing or validating UTF-8 strings before passing them to libxml2's xmlTextWriterWriteAttribute function. This function expects valid UTF-8 input, and when it receives malformed UTF-8, it misparses it.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Memory leak due to misparsing of malformed UTF-8 strings",
        "Lack of sanitization of user-supplied input"
      ],
      "impact": "A memory leak occurs, potentially exposing sensitive memory contents in the resulting output.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks where an attacker sends a request with malformed UTF-8 strings through an XML attribute writer function"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control input to the application, specifically to the `xmlTextWriterWriteAttribute` function, and supply a malformed UTF-8 string.",
       "additional_notes": "The issue is present in PHP5 versions prior to 5.4.4. The root cause lies within PHP's handling of UTF-8 strings before passing them to the libxml2 library, and not within the libxml2 library itself according to upstream."
