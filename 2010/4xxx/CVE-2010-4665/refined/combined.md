1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=695887#c0)  Josh Bressers    2011-04-12 21:19:01 UTC  ``` The libtiff utility tiffdump contains an integer overflow which can be triggered when operating in a directory containing a large number of files.  Upstream bug: <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2218>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=695887#c2)  Josh Bressers    2011-04-13 12:50:33 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw has already been fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 by a patch included in RHSA-2010:0519.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=695887#c3)  Josh Bressers    2011-04-13 14:41:27 UTC  ``` Created libtiff tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 696204](show_bug.cgi?id=696204 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2009-5022 CVE-2010-4665 libtiff various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=695887#c4)  Tom Lane    2011-04-13 15:50:51 UTC  ``` So far as I can tell, this is not only not a security issue, it's not a bug at all.  That fax2ps.c code is exactly the same upstream in 3.9.4 and 3.9.5 except for a gratuitous change in the spelling of the error message.  It looks to me like the submitted patch was entirely reverted by Bob Friesenhahn per <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2118#c6> IOW, the original proposed patch was just plain wrong and unnecessary.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=695887#c5)  Josh Bressers    2011-04-13 18:08:51 UTC  ``` I had the wrong upstream bug for this one. I fixed my above comment, but we already fixed this issue in RHSA-2010:0519. No further action is needed.  Sorry for the confusion.   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

# USN-1416-1: tiff vulnerabilities

4 April 2012

The TIFF library could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [tiff](/security/cves?package=tiff) - Tag Image File Format (TIFF) library

## Details

Alexander Gavrun discovered that the TIFF library incorrectly allocated

space for a tile. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary

code with user privileges, or crash the application, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2012-1173](/security/CVE-2012-1173))

It was discovered that the tiffdump utility incorrectly handled directory

data structures with many directory entries. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker

could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. This issue only applied to

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.10 and Ubuntu 11.04.

Debian Bug     : 678140

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Tiff, a library set and tools
to support the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), allowing denial of service and
potential privilege escalation.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited via a specially crafted TIFF image.

CVE-2012-2113
  The tiff2pdf utility has an integer overflow error when parsing images.

CVE-2012-3401
  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala discovered heap-based buffer overflow in the
  t2p_read_tiff_init() function.

CVE-2010-2482
  An invalid td_stripbytecount field is not properly handle and can trigger a
  NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2010-2595
  An array index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input." in the
  TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function causes an unexpected crash.

CVE-2010-2597
  Also related to "downsampled OJPEG input", the TIFFVStripSize function crash
  unexpectly.

CVE-2010-2630
  The TIFFReadDirectory function does not properly validate the data types of
  codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in a TIFF file.

CVE-2010-4665
  The tiffdump utility has an integer overflow in the ReadDirectory function.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
