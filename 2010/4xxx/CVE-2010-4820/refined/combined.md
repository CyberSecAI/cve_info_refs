## Synopsis

Moderate: ghostscript security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0096)

## Topic

Updated ghostscript packages that fix two security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ghostscript is a set of software that provides a PostScript interpreter, a
set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library, which implements the graphics
capabilities in the PostScript language) and an interpreter for Portable
Document Format (PDF) files.

Ghostscript included the current working directory in its library search
path by default. If a user ran Ghostscript without the "-P-" option in an
attacker-controlled directory containing a specially-crafted PostScript
library file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript
code. With this update, Ghostscript no longer searches the current working
directory for library files by default. (CVE-2010-4820)

Note: The fix for CVE-2010-4820 could possibly break existing
configurations. To use the previous, vulnerable behavior, run Ghostscript
with the "-P" option (to always search the current working directory
first).

A flaw was found in the way Ghostscript interpreted PostScript Type 1 and
PostScript Type 2 font files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
PostScript Type 1 or PostScript Type 2 font file that, when interpreted,
could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2010-4054)

Users of Ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

## Synopsis

Moderate: ghostscript security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0095)

## Topic

Updated ghostscript packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ghostscript is a set of software that provides a PostScript interpreter, a
set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library, which implements the graphics
capabilities in the PostScript language) and an interpreter for Portable
Document Format (PDF) files.

An integer overflow flaw was found in Ghostscript's TrueType bytecode
interpreter. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript or PDF
file that, when interpreted, could cause Ghostscript to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-3743)

It was found that Ghostscript always tried to read Ghostscript system
initialization files from the current working directory before checking
other directories, even if a search path that did not contain the current
working directory was specified with the "-I" option, or the "-P-" option
was used (to prevent the current working directory being searched first).
If a user ran Ghostscript in an attacker-controlled directory containing a
system initialization file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary
PostScript code. (CVE-2010-2055)

Ghostscript included the current working directory in its library search
path by default. If a user ran Ghostscript without the "-P-" option in an
attacker-controlled directory containing a specially-crafted PostScript
library file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript
code. With this update, Ghostscript no longer searches the current working
directory for library files by default. (CVE-2010-4820)

Note: The fix for CVE-2010-4820 could possibly break existing
configurations. To use the previous, vulnerable behavior, run Ghostscript
with the "-P" option (to always search the current working directory
first).

A flaw was found in the way Ghostscript interpreted PostScript Type 1 and
PostScript Type 2 font files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
PostScript Type 1 or PostScript Type 2 font file that, when interpreted,
could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2010-4054)

Users of Ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:06:17 UTC  ``` Security flaws were found in the way gs handled its initialization: 1, library search path include '.' (current working directory) by default,    causing ghostscript to search '.' for initialization and library postscript    files 2, explicit use of "-P-" command line option, did not prevent ghostscript from    executing PostScript commands, contained within "gs_init.ps" file.   A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary PostScript commands, if the victim was tricked into opening a PostScript file in the directory writeable by the attacker  References: [1] <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691339> [2] <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691350> [3] <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/511433> [4] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583316> [5] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608071> [6] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583183>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:18:58 UTC  ``` Initial list of packages, shipped within Fedora, which might be affected by this:  1, a2ps 2, asymptote 3, c2050 4, cups 5, cups-pdf 6, dblatex 7, efax 8, evince 9, fig2ps 10, flpsed 11, grace 12, gimp 13, hevea 14, hpijs 15, hpoj 16, kdissert 17, latex-mk 18, latexmk 19, mpage 20, pnm2ppa 21, prosper 22, ps2eps 23, pstoedit 24, scribus 25, texmacs 26, wv 27, xfig 28, xournal 29, xpaint  Above list is currently under investigation, and will be updated later, as soon as more details are available.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:21:59 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 599168](show_bug.cgi?id=599168 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Ghostscript is vulnerable to CVE-2010-2055") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:25:51 UTC  ``` Another list from SUSE's Werner Fink:   [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608071#c23>  to compare against.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c4)  M.

Several of these fails to apply to 8.71.  As for -dSAFER, I'd rather stick more closely to upstream.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=771853#c0)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-05 09:08:30 UTC  ``` Ghostscript included the current working directory in its library search path by default. If a user ran Ghostscript without the "-P-" option in an attacker-controlled directory containing a specially-crafted PostScript library file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript code. With this update, Ghostscript no longer searches the current working directory for library files by default. ([CVE-2010-4820](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4820))  Note: The fix for [CVE-2010-4820](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4820) could possibly break existing configurations. To use the previous, vulnerable behavior, run Ghostscript with the "-P" option (to always search the current working directory first).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=771853#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-08 13:24:21 UTC  ``` This issue was originally tracked with [CVE-2010-2055](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2055) via [bug #599564](show_bug.cgi?id=599564 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2055 ghostscript: gs_init.ps searched in current directory despite -P-").

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=771853#c0)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-05 09:08:30 UTC  ``` Ghostscript included the current working directory in its library search path by default. If a user ran Ghostscript without the "-P-" option in an attacker-controlled directory containing a specially-crafted PostScript library file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript code. With this update, Ghostscript no longer searches the current working directory for library files by default. ([CVE-2010-4820](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4820))  Note: The fix for [CVE-2010-4820](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4820) could possibly break existing configurations. To use the previous, vulnerable behavior, run Ghostscript with the "-P" option (to always search the current working directory first).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=771853#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-08 13:24:21 UTC  ``` This issue was originally tracked with [CVE-2010-2055](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2055) via [bug #599564](show_bug.cgi?id=599564 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2055 ghostscript: gs_init.ps searched in current directory despite -P-").  It got a separate CVE id, as it is separate issue, see e.g.:   [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2973/focus=3354](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2973/focus%3D3354)  Issue was tracked upstream in:   <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691339>  Following upstream commit changes ghostscript's default to not include CWD in the library search path by default (SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=0 if the default now):   <http://svn.ghostscript.com/viewvc?view=rev&revision=11494>  Flaw type:   CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element   <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=771853#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-02 22:33:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2012:0096 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0096.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=771853#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-02 22:46:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0095.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=691339#c0)  Paul Szabo    2010-05-26 03:27:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6321](attachment.cgi?id=6321 "security wrapper") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6321&action=edit "security wrapper") security wrapper  Referring to:   <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691316>   <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/511433>  I see that at gs tries many files in (under) current directory at startup, so it is dangerous to do e.g.   cd /tmp; gs any.ps  To see list of files that gs tries, use:   strace -omylog gs; grep '"\./' mylog | sort -u  I now use a security wrapper (attached), to protect.  Cheers,  Paul Szabo   psz@maths.usyd.edu.au   <http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/psz/> School of Mathematics and Statistics   University of Sydney    Australia ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=691339#c1)  Hin-Tak Leung    2010-05-26 22:53:54 UTC  ``` AFAIK this is as documented. See doc/Use.htm on the '-P' , '-P-' switches for turning this behavior on and off. This is not new and changing it would upset other people. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=691339#c10)  Ray Johnston    2010-05-27 20:51:19 UTC  ``` Ghostscript makefiles have a macro to make -P- the default.  Set SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=0 on your make line and voila!  See the comments in:  # Define whether or not searching for initialization files should always # look in the current directory first.  This leads to well-known security # and confusion problems, but users insist on it. # NOTE: this also affects searching for files named on the command line: # see the "File searching" section of Use.htm for full details. # Because of this, setting SEARCH_HERE_FIRST to 0 is not recommended.  This comment, and the build macro and -P- flag date back to at least 1997 (the oldest I have readily available -- version 5.03) so this issue, and our cautionary note have been known since then.  The number of ghostscript users has grown, so changing the way that ghostscript finds files at this point would be painful for many users, and unless the comments relate to a way to make this 'painless' for existing users, please cease comments on this bug. The issue is CLOSED !!!  Also, PLEASE make sure you have contacted the maintainers of the clients of ghostscript (gv, cups, etc). to let them know that in your opinion they should be using -P- along with -dSAFER. That way they can also address the need to explicitly specify paths on files they provide as input. ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
