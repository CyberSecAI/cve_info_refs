Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an improper access control check in the authoring tool component of IBM Web Content Manager. Users with only "editor" access at the library resource level were able to see the authoring tool link to create drafts, even though they lacked the "approver" permission required for this action according to the information center documentation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The application failed to properly enforce the permission requirements for creating drafts. It incorrectly displayed the "create draft" link to users who did not have the necessary "approver" permission.
*   **UI/Logic Discrepancy:** The user interface presented options (the "create draft" link) that the user was not authorized to use, leading to an error later in the workflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Limited Impact:** While users could click the "create draft" link, it would eventually result in an error message in the portlet stating that the user is not authorized to perform the action.
*   **Potential for Confusion/Frustration:** The primary impact is that users who lacked the proper permissions could be confused by the presence of the option and frustrated when it failed.
*   The vulnerability does not allow the user to bypass the access control completely, as the user cannot save the draft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **UI Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the user interface; users simply have to click the "create draft" link, which was improperly displayed to them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Editor Access:** The attacker (user) needs to have "editor" access on content at the library resource level in IBM Web Content Manager. This is a legitimate permission, but it's insufficient to create drafts as designed.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability is a case of insufficient access control. The system incorrectly displayed the "create draft" link to users who should not have had that option based on their permissions. The result was a minor denial of service in terms of user frustration, but the access control was enforced during the actual draft creation process, which meant the user was not able to save the draft. The issue was resolved by ensuring the "edit" button for authoring tools is only visible to users who possess both edit and approve access.

This is more detailed than the typical CVE description which would say something like "Insufficient access control in IBM Web Content Manager could allow an unauthorized user to view authoring links they are not permitted to access."
