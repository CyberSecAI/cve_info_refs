{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple GLX X calls lack proper input sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization in several GLX X calls.",
      "Missing checks for negative screen numbers in `validGlxScreen` function.",
      "Inadequate request length validation during GLX command processing, potentially leading to buffer overflows.",
       "Improper handling of client endianness during attribute list processing, enabling potential memory corruption.",
      "Missing checks on the `numAttribs` field, allowing attackers to specify arbitrarily large values leading to memory issues.",
       "Lack of validation of the `length` field in certain requests, potentially leading to code injection."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to GLX calls can potentially cause the X server to crash or execute arbitrary code. Exploitation may lead to the exposure of arbitrary memory regions or complete server compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with access to the GLX calls can send specially crafted requests lacking proper input validation to the X server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be authorized to connect to the display server and have access to GLX calls (typically the logged-in user)."
