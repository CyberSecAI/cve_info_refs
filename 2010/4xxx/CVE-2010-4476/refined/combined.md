6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory - February 2011

## Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory - February 2011

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE and Java for Business also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes across Java SE and Java for Business products.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below.  Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

#### Patch Availability Table

| Product Group | Risk Matrix | Patch Availability and Installation Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle Java SE and Java for Business | [Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Risk Matrix](#AppendixJAVA) | Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update February 2011 [My Oracle Support Note 1282490.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=447945977433634&id=1282490.1) Consumer users of Oracle Java SE can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows platform can also use [automatic updates](//www.java.com/en/download/help/5000020700.xml) to get the latest release |

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. Hence Oracle recommends that customers upgrade their Oracle products to a supported version.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle: Afik Castiel from Versafe Anti Fraud; Billy Rios of Google; binaryproof via Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative; binaryproof via iDefense; Dmitri Gribenko; Eduardo Vela Nava of Google; Frederic Hoguin via Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative; Marc Schoenefeld of Red Hat; Peter Csepely via Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative; Roee Hay and Yair Amit of IBM Rational Application Security Research Group; Sami Koivu via Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative; Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security; and Tom Hawtin.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE and Java for Business

#### Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE and Java for Business.  19 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.

CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). Where the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", and the corresponding CVSS Base score is 7.5 instead of 10 respectively.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?_afrLoop=447848896303929&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include a JDK.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2011verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1291877.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1291877.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for your releases.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1291877.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1291877.1) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Java Hangs When Converting 2.2250738585072012e-308

By [Rick Regan](https://www.exploringbinary.com/about/) January 31st, 2011

[Konstantin Preißer](https://www.preisser-it.de "Konstantin Preisser’s Web Site") made an [interesting discovery](https://www.exploringbinary.com/why-volatile-fixes-the-2-2250738585072011e-308-bug/comment-page-1/#comment-4645 "See Konstantin Preisser’s Comments on Rick Regan's Article “Why “Volatile” Fixes the 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug”"), after reading my article “[PHP Hangs On Numeric Value 2.2250738585072011e-308](https://www.exploringbinary.com/php-hangs-on-numeric-value-2-2250738585072011e-308/ "Read Rick Regan's Article “PHP Hangs On Numeric Value 2.2250738585072011e-308”")”: Java — both its runtime and *compiler* — go into an infinite loop when converting the decimal number 2.2250738585072012e-308 to double-precision binary floating-point. This number is supposed to convert to 0x1p-1022, which is DBL\_MIN; instead, Java gets stuck, oscillating between 0x1p-1022 and 0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022, the largest subnormal double-precision floating-point number.

## Send a Java Program Into An Infinite Loop

Compile this program and run it; the program will hang (at least it does on a 32-bit system with the latest JRE/JDK):

```

class runhang {
public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Test:");
  double d = Double.parseDouble("2.2250738585072012e-308");
  System.out.println("Value: " + d);
 }
}

```
## Send the Java Compiler Into An Infinite Loop

Try to compile this program; *the compiler will hang*:

```

class compilehang {
public static void main(String[] args) {
  double d = 2.2250738585072012e-308;
  System.out.println("Value: " + d);
 }
}

```

## Where’s the Problem?

For the runtime case at least, Konstantin has narrowed the problem down to the “correction loop” in [FloatingDecimal.java](http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/misc/FloatingDecimal.java.html "FloatingDecimal.java"). See [his comments](https://www.exploringbinary.com/why-volatile-fixes-the-2-2250738585072011e-308-bug/comment-page-1/#comment-4645 "See Konstantin Preisser’s Comments on Rick Regan's Article “Why “Volatile” Fixes the 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug”") on my PHP bug analysis article.

Like PHP, Java gets stuck crossing the normalized/unnormalized border, but in the opposite direction: it starts with an estimate just below DBL\_MIN — 0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022 — and is trying to get up to DBL\_MIN. but with a twist: it starts with an estimate that is correct — DBL\_MIN — and then adjusts it to 0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022. It then adjusts *that* back to DBL\_MIN, and [around it goes…](https://www.exploringbinary.com/a-closer-look-at-the-java-2-2250738585072012e-308-bug/ "Read Rick Regan's Article “A Closer Look at the Java 2.2250738585072012e-308 Bug”")

## Bug Report

Konstantin reported this problem to Oracle three weeks ago, but is still waiting for a reply. (Update: as per Konstantin’s comment below, the bug has been assigned “internal review ID of 1949967, which is NOT visible on the Sun Developer Network (SDN)”.)

### Update: Previous Bug Reports Describe the Same Problem

Readers found two bug reports that describe the same problem (although not in terms of the magic number 2.2250738585072012e-308): [bug number 100119 from 2009](http://bugs.openjdk.java.net/show_bug.cgi?id=100119 "See Bug Report 100119 "), and [bug number 4421494 from **2001**](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4421494 "See Bug Report 4421494 "). (But don’t bother clicking on that last one — the link is now dead, as of 2/3/11.)

## Addendum

As pointed out in the comments below, equivalent forms of the number cause the problem as well; examples:

* 0.00022250738585072012e-304 (decimal point placement)
* 00000000002.2250738585072012e-308 (leading zeros)
* 2.225073858507201200000e-308 (trailing zeros)
* 2.2250738585072012e-00308 (leading zeros in the exponent)
* 2.2250738585072012997800001e-308 (superfluous digits beyond digit 17)

   Hi,

   thanks for publishing this article! 🙂

   Note that the ‘correction loop’ that I was referring to, is at lines 1473 – 1599 of the linked FloatingDecimal.java (marked wtih “correctionLoop”). If these lines are removed, the function does not hang any more, but the result for other numbers is less accurate than with that correction loop.

   This could also be used as a workaround, if you need to provide a user interface from a java application where the user can enter a string which is converted to a double, and it is critical that the application must not hang (e.g. when parsing the String in a Java Servlet, which is used just like PHP for creating dynamic websites), you can copy the FloatingDecimal.java into your project (change the “package sun.misc;” line), and remove the “correction loop”.

   Then you would need to replace “Double.parseDouble(…)” with “yourPackage.FloatingDecimal.readJavaFormatString(…).doubleValue()”.

   However, I think this bug is less critical than PHP’s bug, because Java Servlets are not used as much as PHP, and because of Java’s strong type system, you would have explicitly use “Double.parseDouble()” to parse a String containg a floating point number.

   Of course, it follows that scala has the same problem. If you start up the command line interpreter (scala w/o any arguments) and ask it to evaluate the value under discussion, it will hang, hogging a CPU. I assume the same will go for compiled programs as well.

   Works on Google documents too! (Spreadsheet)

   Enter this double value into a cell (you may or may not have to force the back-end to evaluate the value by inserting something like “=+2” into a different cell).

   The Ajax back-end hangs until it times out.

    Uh… use BigDecimal instead? Double and Floats are known to be buggy and have problems with some operations (like division). BigDecimal was created to address those problems.

    Hello,

    @g0dkar:

    Float and Double are used for fast floating point arithmetics, and they are in general not buggy (except this bug here). It is just the nature of floating point numbers. You should not just use BigDecimal instead of Double, because BigDecimal is intended for use when you need to do calulations which are more accurate than Doubles.

    However BigDecimal is MUCH slower than double, because it doesn’t use floating point arithmetics, but does the calculations manually (for example, a calulation which takes 0,017 ms with doubles, took 25780,43 ms with BigDecimal).

    So you should not generally replace double with BigDecimals. As long as you don’t need a better precision than Double, you should use Double.

    @Michael,

    2.2250738585072014e-308 is the “canonical” form of DBL\_MIN, but all five of these 17 digit numbers map to DBL\_MIN:

    – 2.2250738585072012e-308

    – 2.2250738585072013e-308

    – 2.2250738585072014e-308

    – 2.2250738585072015e-308

    – 2.2250738585072016e-308

    2.2250738585072014e-308 is probably chosen because it is “safely” in the middle (and round-trips to boot).

    Note that runhang and compilehang work perfectly(?) in the Java 1.5.0 implementation of the GNU Compiler Collection (tested with gij/gcj 4.4.5) on a 32-bit system.

    It also works with 2.2250738585072011e-308.

    However, the output is 2.225073858507201E-308 using both numbers.

    I’m less than impressed but not at all surprised that Oracle doesn’t take this seriously. What, the PHP bug was fixed in 3 days, Oracle hasn’t even responded in 3 weeks! Jeez,the JVM is certainly in the right hands! I can’t wait until the first hacker creates a crawler that posts this number to forms, rest-apis and attackable surfaces all over the net, wreaking all kinds of havoc. My bet is that this will happen in the next couple of days/weeks. In my experience, lots of developers do string=>primitive conversion before they do form validation, so I believe the impact of this could potentially be huge. Even if/when Oracle eventually get around to roll out a fix that works, it will still take ages until the patch is adopted by slow moving corporations. I’m surprised I haven’t read about this in any big IT newspaper yet.

    By the way, there is another Bug in Sun’s Java 6 (at least under Windows) which crashes the VM. Try this:

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    BufferedImage rendImg = new BufferedImage(100, 100, BufferedImage.TYPE\_3BYTE\_BGR);

    BufferedImage drawImg = new BufferedImage(100, 100, BufferedImage.TYPE\_INT\_ARGB);

    g.transform(new AffineTransform(1E-16, 0.0, -1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0));

    g.drawImage(rendImg, -rendImg.getWidth() / 2, -rendImg.getHeight() / 2, null);

    }

    This is a really, really big deal.

    Most Java web application frameworks use tools like apache BeanUtils to automatically populate typed object fields from string http parameters. Any application that populates a double or Double from a form is now susceptible to a serious denial-of-service attack. REST frameworks are probably equally vulnerable.

    It wouldn’t be hard to shut down rather large chunks of the (java-powered) internet with this. How many appservers are smart enough to terminate cpu-bound threads? Not the common ones. This will require operator intervention.

    All you’d need is a script that crawls the net looking for forms, and posts that # for every field. Yikes.

    This problem was already reported at the end of 2009 but apparently was not considered critical:

    That seems correct.

    If you enter a Value between A:= 1\*2^(-1022) – 0.5\*2^(-52)\*2^(-1022) and B:= 1\*2^(-1022), it hangs.

    A ~= 2.225073858507201136057409796709131975934 \* 10 ^ (-308);

    b ~= 2.225073858507201383090232717332404064219 \* 10 ^ (-308);

    For example, System.out.println(Double.parseDouble(“2.225073858507201136057409796709131975934E-308”));

    works, but

    System.out.println(Double.parseDouble(“2.225073858507201136057409796709131975935E-308”));

    A = 2^(-1022) – 2^(-1075)

    B = 2^(-1022)

    Hmm, although in that bug report it says, the upper boundary is 2^(-1022) (Double.MIN\_NORMAL), that’s not quite correct.

    It seems the upper bound is

    B = 2^(-1022) – 2^(-1076)

    ~= 2.225073858507201259573821257020768020077 \* 10 ^ (-308)

    Rick, saying that we didn’t take it seriously until you publicized is more coincidental than systematic, I think. You reported the bug on Thursday Dec.30. The holidays and New Year’s meant fewer eyes on the bug reports and you “publicized” it on Monday Jan.3 when at least some of the core folks were just sobering up and getting back online. At that point we fixed it quickly. It was about a week from bug report to a new release.

    We also get a lot of completely bogus bug reports. It takes a while to sort through the chaff. For future reference, for any bugs that seem security-related, email security@php.net.

    Hi Rasmus,

    Point taken about the holidays. I’m willing to believe it was just bad timing (maybe I should have been partying and not messing around with subnormal numbers :)). From my point of view though it was such a simple bug to reproduce (one line of code) that I expected at least a response to the effect of “we can/can’t reproduce this.” But like you said — and like I already acknowledged — you took care of it quickly once “more eyes” were on it.

    In any case, I’ll expect MY bug reports to be fast-tracked in the future 🙂 .

    | BTW, have you seen [my article analyzing the bug](https://www.exploringbinary.com/why-volatile-fixes-the-2-2250738585072011e-308-bug/ "Read Rick Regan's Article “Why “Volatile” Fixes the 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug”")?

    Hi,

    the bug report on OpenJDK suggests to change in FloatingDecimal.java inside the ‘correction loop’:

    – if ( (bigIntNBits == 1) && (bigIntExp > -expBias) ){

    + if ( (bigIntNBits == 1) && (bigIntExp > -expBias+1) ){

    If I change this line in the FloatingPoint.java and then try

    System.out.println(myPackage.FloatingDecimal.readJavaFormatString(“2.2250738585072012e-308”).doubleValue());

    it does not hang any more, and correctly prints “2.2250738585072014E-308” as result. So I guess that change fixes the bug 😉

     Rick, I did read your analysis, yes. You spend way too much time pondering this stuff.

     As for being simple to reproduce. Personally I had to go find a 32-bit vm image before I could reproduce it, so it was more than just a 1-line test script’s worth of effort. PHP bugs also go through a couple of levels of review. An initial quick bogus filter to weed out the ridiculous or incomplete ones. Since your bug wasn’t immediately marked bogus, you passed that. Then typically a closer look by someone more experienced, in this case Pierre, who was able to reproduce it and poked Dmitry for his take on it since he knows that part of the code best. Dmitry was unfortunately away skiing somewhere in Siberia, or somewhere equally remote which slowed things down by another day. I think it was then Derick who figured out it went away with -O0 which is always a bad sign and we zeroed in on it from there. I was visiting Facebook and sat down with Scott there and we tested a couple of different fixes and we determined just marking it volatile was the safest short-term fix for now.

     So, that was the full story of the fix.

     I would be interested in seeing the equivalent story for the 2009-reported Java version of this. 🙂

     @Roger Lewis

     Java 5 is at end of life. Will an eventual bug fix be released for this platform as well?

     While we’re waiting for the fix, feel free to play around with this little curl-invocation:

     curl -H “Accept-Language: en-us;q=2.2250738585072012e-308” <http://url>

     Any Tomcat-server calling getLocale() on the request (i.e most of them, especially those with Spring) will hang the processing thread. Not sure about jetty, oc4j etc but I guess they have similar weaknesses.

     Hello,

     @Erik

     I am using Tomcat 7.0.6 for hosting Java Servlets on my Websites, and I tried to send this HTTP request:

     GET / HTTP/1.1

     Host: myhost

     Connection: keep-alive

     Accept-Language: en-us;q=2.2250738585072012e-308

     However it doesn’t seem to have any effect. Tomcat processes the request normally and doesn’t hang. (I don’t use any getLocale() calls, may this be the reason?)

     @Rasmus,

     Yes, I DO spend way too much time pondering this stuff. But c’mon: double rounding on underflow — how cool is that? You don’t see THAT everyday!

     Thanks for the full backstory. The only thing I’ll still say is that since it was reproducible, at least that much should have been stated in the initial bug report response (and perhaps it should have been marked as a security issue at that point?).

     In any case, it doesn’t seem any harm has come to the Web from this, and I learned a ton from writing the articles.

     Thanks for reading.

     @Konstantin

     Try calling request.getLocale() in one of your servlets. If your goal is just to check it out, you can also try it on Tomcats helloworld-servlet that is bundled in the release – it calls request.getLocale.

     The actual trouble occurs in org.apache.catalina.connector.Request.parseLocalesHeader where this code is run:

     // Extract the quality factor for this entry

     double quality = 1.0;

     int semi = entry.indexOf(“;q=”);

     if (semi >= 0) {

     try {

     quality = Double.parseDouble(entry.substring(semi + 3));

     } catch (NumberFormatException e) {

     quality = 0.0;

     }

     entry = entry.substring(0, semi);

     }

     I added this fix to FloatingDecimal.java

     1475: int iterationCount = 100;

     1477: while (–iterationCount > 0) {

     Inserted after 1599:

     if (iterationCount == 0) {

     throw new NumberFormatException(“SPIN LOOP DETECTED – TRAPPING EXPLOIT. Value = ” + this.toString());

     }

     At least this way, you will be able to detect anyone using the exploit.

     I’m sure you can loop fewer than 100 times, but I did that just to be safe as the code in that loop is hairy.

     Obviously, you’ll need to do bad things with rt.jar and replace sun.misc.FloatingDecimal.class with this one, which is against the license agreement… so this is for information purposes only!

     Since this affects JRuby, I decided to find a workaround that doesn’t involve tweaking rt.jar-based classes. I blogged my solution here: <http://blog.headius.com/2011/02/working-around-java-doubleparsedouble.html>

     It’s not particularly elegant but it works. I essentially just use BigDecimal to parse the mantissa, and then proceed from there back to a primitive double. I believe it solves the cases in question, but I’d love to have feedback on ways to improve it (on my blog…I’m not monitoring this post for comments).

     Further to my previous post #59 – You don’t specifically need to fiddle with rt.jar.

     You can of course put FloatingDecimal in it’s own jar and run java with

     -Xbootclasspath/p:

     to prepend the new FloatingDecimal to the boot clas path.

     Either way works 🙂

     Also, I’ve ran Double.parseDouble nearly a billion times with random values to parse, and the maximum iterations encountered with the set I’ve tested is 3.

     100 is definately overkill, but I’m still very nervous about reducing it to 3!

     Description

     java version “1.3.0”

     Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.0-C)

     Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.0-C, mixed mode)

     Parsing double literals very near the exact halfway point of the cutoff for

     denormalized numbers has some problems. This cutoff can be determined as the

     average of Double.longBitsToDouble(0x0010000000000000L) and

     Double.longBitsToDouble(0x000fffffffffffffL), using the precise math of

     java.math.BigInteger. The halfway point must round up, according to IEEE 754

     round-to-nearest rules.

     With this example, the literal is larger than the lines – be sure that there are

     no line breaks in the actual number when compiling.

     Basically, appending a non-zero extension at the end of the literal

     causes java.lang.Double.parseDouble to enter an infinite loop. As javac

     uses this library call, it is impossible to compile this example:

     class Literal {

     public static void main(String[] args) {

     System.out.println(

     0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

     Tomcat has committed changes to parseLocalesHeader() late in the night of February 1st, 2011 that fix the Accept-Language issue. The HTTP/1.1 spec says the q value should have 3 digits after the period maximum, so they implemented that.

     The fix is in the recently released Tomcat 6.0.32, in the soon-to-be-released Tomcat 7.0.7, and will be in the next 5.5.x release. It is not in Tomcat 5.5.32, which was released a mere couple of hours before the fix went in.

     Hi

     It is hanging only for “2.2250738585072012e-308”, for other numbers say “2.2250738585072011e-308” or “2.2250738585072013e-308” and so on, working fine (not hanging)….

     Hi,

     @prabhu

     It is not only hanging for 2.2250738585072012e-308.

     It is hanging for any number between

     2^(-1022) – 2^(-1075) and

     2^(-1022) – 2^(-1076).

     For example, 2.22507385850720117e-308

     @phraktle,

     I tried FLT\_MIN (1.175494351e-38 = [2-126](https://www.exploringbinary.com/what-powers-of-two-look-like-inside-a-computer/#float-powers-of-two "Read Rick Regan's article “What Powers of Two Look Like Inside a Computer”")) and a couple of values around it but there was no problem. The code in *floatValue()* is a little different than *doubleValue()*; for one, there is no correction loop. This is probably because it has enough intermediate precision (double-precision) to compute it accurately.

     @Konstantin, @g0dkar:

     I’m with g0dkar on this one.

     Been doing Java since 1.0.2 and have yet to come up with a good reason to NOT use BigDecimal. Long ago learned to avoid doubles and floats in Java at ALL costs.

     This works:

     BigDecimal d = new BigDecimal(“2.2250738585072012e-308”);

     If your app is SO performance sensitive that you need double/float rather than BigDecimal, consider Fortran.

     Hello,

     @intelectual\_tortoise

     I would agree with you that if you need to to scientifical calculations which require a much higher precision (a mantissa with more than 52 bit), you should use BigDecimal than double.

     But besides that, double can be about 1516370 % faster than BigDecimal (if you do calculations which causes a growth of the mantissa, which is normally what you’re doing). If you do not require much higher precision than double, there really is no reason to use BigDecimal instead of double. Why would you like to avoid doubles and use extremely slow BigDecimal for your calculations? (You are right that you should avoid floats, as they are very less accurate, and only use them if you need to save memory).

     Especially if you need to program algorithms that take a lot of calculations with floating point numbers, it’s not advisable to use BigDecimal instead of double.

     Note that BigDecimal also requires much more memory than double, because every time it’s value changes, a new BigDecimal object needs to be created, whereas a double always takes 8 bytes, and is hardware-implemented by the underying processor.

     Please also note that since Java 1.0.2, a lot of improvements have been made to the JVM (HotSpot), for example JIT which makes Java applications nearly as fast as C(++) or other language which compile to native code.

     Hmm, it’s actually not 1516370 %, but 151649488 % (I was referring to my comment above, where I made a comparison of double and BigDecimal, where double took 0,017 ms and BigDecimal 25780,43 ms.)

     “compilehang” hangs on IBM JREs for AIX 5.3, both 64 bits and 32 bits (Java 6 SR6 pap6460sr6-20090925\_01 and pap3260sr6-20090925\_01).

     @Konstantin

     My perspective is from mostly business-oriented applications. Any performance hit associated with BigDecimal is more than made up for by not having to mop up after float/double rounding issues.

     The mantissas are relatively small, the calculations are to fixed decimal places, etc.

     Memory’s not really an issue with modern GC: calculations are usually done in a fixed scope, objects go out of scope and are GC’ed.

     If an application domain requires so many float/double calculations with large mantissas that performance becomes an issue, it begs the question whether or not Java is the right tool.

     Not sure I’m following. I’m not saying change the language. Neither am I saying don’t fix the bug. I’m just stating that I can’t imagine too many reasons to use the float/double aspect of the language in the problem domains for which the language is naturally suited.

     Unless there are transitive calls to parseDouble() from other Java internal methods in rt.jar (there are, but harder to exploit directly), one can use aspectj and load-time weaving to safeguard parseDouble calls as in:

     package hotfixes;

     public aspect ParseDoubleHotFix

     {

     double around(String s):

     !within(hotfixes.\*\*) &&

     call(double java.lang.Double.parseDouble(String)) &&

     args(s)

     {

     if (s.indexOf(“2250738585072012”) >= 0) {

     throw new IllegalArgumentException(

     “We apologize for inconvenience, but this number is temporarily not” +

     ” parseable by Oracle: ” + s);

     } else {

     return Double.parseDouble(s);

     }

     }

     }

     And then running java with: java -javaagent:…/aspectjweaver\*.jar …

     Works like a charm for Tomcat, for example (before they applied the Accept-Language patch).

     So, in reality, your aspect doesn’t quite catch everything – there are quite a few other bits you’d need to weave around. I think fundamentally you’d be much better off prepending a patched FloatingDouble to the bootstrap classpath and you can be damn sure you’ll be protected.

     @Gary

     Sure, you’re right — prepending bootclasspath is the right way to go. I just thought the AspectJ solution is an elegant approach to the problem (in fact, to be complete you’d need to catch Double.valueOf() and Method.invoke() too).

     Even so, when you do the weaving, it’s nice to see in the weaver log where all these double.parsedouble calls are (as in the Tomcat example).

     Thank you. We are adding an additional link to our download page, outside of the Oracle Support site. The download has been on the link below since the CVE was released, we are just adding links to make it easier to get to the page:

     @Dawid Weiss: The method you wanted to safeguard was probably sun.misc.FloatingDecimal#doubleValue() which is where the error really is/was.

     I just reproduced with JRockit 1.6.0\_22 on Windows.

     I also confirmed that this does not hang:

     new BigDecimal(“2.2250738585072012e-308”)

     @boa13

     Oh, this would be too simple… I was talking about load-time weaving and because aspectj weaver is written in Java, FloatingDecimal is loaded way before anything else is executed at the weaver level. So you can’t weave FloatingDecimal directly (with load-time weaving).

     Also, like I said — this was just an idea for a nice and elegant solution; for production I’d prepend bootclasspath with the patched FloatingDecimal.

     I just confirmed the issue on this JVM:

     $ java -version

     java version “1.4.2”

     Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2)

     Classic VM (build 1.4.2, J2RE 1.4.2 IBM AIX build ca142ifx-20100215 (SR13 FP4) (JIT enabled: jitc))

     Notably, this version of Java is what runs WebSphere Commerce, which is what powers the ecommerce sites of some of the biggest retails in the US (if not the world), who I will not name, and hope no other commenter names. Using a few curl invocations, someone could ruins the days of quite a few fortune 500’s.

     I’m currently emailing as many of these sites as I can, and trying to reach IBM. I suggest others do the same.

     I’m a system admin for an application, runs on WebLogic. WLS shipped with java 1.6.0\_05, the app shipped with 1.5.0\_06. It’s a pretty big deal, end-users all over the org use it 24/7, some outside vendors connect, considered one of our core applications.

     How big a deal is this bug? If it were your app would you pull out the stops to patch? Wait until a schedule maintenance period? Ignore it?

     The blog post said:

     In the spirit of trying to be open about how we approach the responsibilities associated with being the steward of Java, I thought it would be useful to share some of the “behind the scenes” activity involving the Security Alert that we released yesterday.

     @Brian Dunbar:

     My client, who runs one of the biggest e-commerce site in my country, has dealt with it as a major high-priority must-fix issue. They had some floating-point input fields, and were running Tomcat. They had quite a few people work on that as soon as they heard about it, and fixed it in the next 24 hours.

     Anybody on the Internet could have taken the whole site down with a few hundred poisoned requests, which is trivial to do. I believe this was a low-enough volume that this would also have been under the radar of their anti-DDoS measures.

     @Grohl:

     If no code on the server calls getLocale() on the request object, then Tomcat doesn’t die.

     Most frameworks call getLocale() as part of their i18n features. The admin webapps that ship with Tomcat call getLocale() too.

     @Brian Dunbar

     I fully agree with boa13.

     Today my team spent quite a bit of time patching and double-checking (wow, that expression makes sense these days!) more than 100 servers which we run as a part of our SaaS service. Kudos to Oracle, the patch works just fine.

     I just tested (only one request per shop, will cause no harm) on three different European ecommerce sites, all major brands, running on a well known ecommerce SaaS platform. They all could be ddosed with very little effort. If you think about the potential damage caused to an ecommerce site by a mere set of some thousand requests, this is an absolute prio 1 issue.

     Actually the HTTP specs are clear on this: there shouldn’t be more than three digits after the dot. So Tomcat is at least partly faulty too here: there’s no reason to use floating-point numbers to parse a decimal value that has at most three digits after the decimal (it’s a bit as noobish as using floating-point numbers for monetary computations).

     @nono:

     You are right, and Tomcat recognized their fault as soon as they heard about the problem. They fixed their implementation the day after this blog was published.

     Releases including the fix have been made on the three Tomcat branches: Tomcat 5.5.33, Tomcat 6.0.32, and Tomcat 7.0.8 are now fine.

     “you think about the potential damage caused to an ecommerce site by a mere set of some thousand requests, this is an absolute prio 1 issue.”

     My app isn’t an ecommerce site, but it does have hooks to vendors and partners outside my corporate net. So this should be a big deal for me, as well.

     However I’d like to have the vendor give me their .02 worth on updating the java their app uses: there must be a reason why they ship 1.5 . . .

     The vendor doesn’t seem to share my sense of urgency: still waiting for them to call me back, have attempted to escalate the ticket, getting phone tree hell.

     @gbt:

     I told a customer to patch his shop. His IT told me: We’re using IBM JDK, so nothing to do here.

     Well, I couldn’t resist but ran a http-accept-language-you-know-what-I-mean request against his shop, and it took veeeeery long to process.

     So I assume that IBM JDK is affected as well.

     @gbt:

     IBM JREs are affected. See comments #81 and #99.

     @Brian Dunbar:

     All Java versions dating back to 1.3 or maybe even 1.2 are affected. You do not need to update Java: Oracle has released a tool that patches the faulty rt.jar files.

     The second sentence in the abstract at that link says *“This problem only occurs with 2.2250738585072012e-308, which also happens to be the largest floating point number”* (neither are correct).

     I tried this on my .NET 3.5 dev env out of curiousity. No such glitch exists in C# at run-time or compile-time:

     double d1 = Double.Parse(“2.2250738585072012e-308”);

     Console.WriteLine(“Value: ” + d1);

     double d2 = 2.2250738585072012e-308;

     Console.WriteLine(“Value: ” + d2);

     If anyone can find anything similar in .NET I’d love to play with it, I can’t find anything like this, how boring!

     @Tim,

     The other “magic number” you can try is [2.2250738585072011e-308](https://www.exploringbinary.com/php-hangs-on-numeric-value-2-2250738585072011e-308/ "Read Rick Regan's Article “PHP Hangs On Numeric Value 2.2250738585072011e-308”"), which tripped up PHP (I don’t think it will trip up .NET though, since I assume it uses its own proprietary conversion algorithm).

Package        : openjdk-6
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4476
Debian Bug     : 612660

It was discovered that the floating point parser in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform, can enter an infinite loop when
processing certain input strings.  Such input strings represent valid
numbers and can be contained in data supplied by an attacker over the
network, leading to a denial-of-service attack.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.3-2~lenny1.  For technical reasons, this update will
be released separately.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.3-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
