attacks
Date: Wed, 29 Sep 2010 17:15:58 +1000
```
Package: python-libcloud
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

libcloud fails to perform ssl validation on https connections.
This means that users of this module, who which perform api requests using https urls / connections are at risk to mitm attacks.
See <http://github.com/tjfontaine/linode-python/issues/issue/1#issue/1> for more information.

That I'll soon submit a patch.

OK, let's say 1 week as worst case expectation - but if someone else
wants to do it before, no problem.

Otherwise, please let me know if the "patch" should be a complete
debdiff for NMU.

I didn't forget this, it's just harder than I thought, in particular
considering I have no cloud computing experience and account.

I'm still committed to fix it (and also asked for help upstream), but
have no precise idea of the time it will take. In particular, any help
is appreciated.

This appears to be still unfixed in current 0.4 and should be reported/
fixed upstream.

Given that libcloud is already outdated, has no reverse deps and
virtually no users in popcon, we should remove it from Squeeze.

Please (not just you, possibly anyone who can test it), just check [1],
then decide freely - I'm not necessarily against removing it, but it's
apparently not that hard to keep it.

Hi apparently I wasn't subscribed to this bug report...
There are many other python packages in debian that do not do ssl
checking as well...
In addition, there is this
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.ssl_match_hostname/>
I haven't checked it at all. I was linked to it from
<http://bugs.python.org/issue1589#msg120947>

Pietro, thanks for your contribution to Debian!

Howeber, the deeper problem is that the maintainer himself didn't followup
on this bug during the last 70 days. As such, I prefer to remove libcloud
from Squeeze. A package like this needs an active maintainer, it's too
volatile to rot in the archive.

If you have a deeper interest in libcloud, you could pick up the maintenance
of libcloud in the future.

[ Adding debian-release to CC, please remove libcloud from testing for now ]

Cheers,
        Moritz

Hi.

I'm the "maintainer". I'll readily admit I've failed miserably to
track this issue appropriately.
Part of it is due to some rather unfortunate e-mail filtering, but
that's certainly not all. (Debian bug mail ended in a folder I didn't
subscribe to, but I noticed the issue when it was first raised on the
libcloud list)

I've had no time to drive this issue personally, but idly following
the upstream libcloud mailing list (where Pietro has done  a great job
trying to get things moving), there doesn't seem to be any resolution.
The final e-mail in the thread (AFAIK) being this:

    [http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-libcloud/201011.mbox/%3CAANLkTi=X9NFBv7igzcAKWUQoumoE-J1tK6duw3Y6as9F@mail.gmail.com%3E](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-libcloud/201011.mbox/%3CAANLkTi%3DX9NFBv7igzcAKWUQoumoE-J1tK6duw3Y6as9F%40mail.gmail.com%3E)

I was sort of hoping it would be resolved soon so that we could get
the fix in. I didn't see much point in getting 0.4 into squeeze since
this issue would remain. (Was that wrong?)

I agree the issue is important. I'm not sure I personally think it
warrants removal, but if that's how things are done, that's of course
fine.

On a more general note, I'm going to thoroughly reconsider my
maintaining this package. I don't really use it anymore, and if I did,
it wouldn't be on Debian, so if anyone else wants to take it over,
that'd be great. If not, it'll be on a best-effort basis, were "best"
probably isn't going to be very awesome :(

Um, well I could see if they would accept a patch I could make up soon...
The problem is / was they closed the bug saying it was a python issue,
where they didnt' even attempt to ensure that a https connection would
be secured, through wrapping it in ssl, iirc.

Never-mind, there has already been a potential patch emailed in that

Hi all,

We have recently implemented SSL verification capability in libcloud 0.4.1-dev (slated for release this week).

For more information: <http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/LibcloudSSL>

The default setting of VERIFY_SSL_CERT=False emits a UserWarning when an SSL connection is first attempted, and provides a CA_CERTS_PATH which includes usage of Debian's ca-certificates package.

Cheers,
Jerry

```

Apache Libcloud 0.4.2 is now available for public consumption:
- <http://incubator.apache.org/libcloud/downloads.html>
- <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/apache-libcloud/0.4.2>

## Background

Python does not perform SSL certificate name verification out of the box.

To address this, we've introduced the **libcloud.security** module with tunable parameters.

Accordingly, the LibcloudHTTPSConnection objects load settings from this module and performs hostname checks against the `commonName` and `subjectAltName` DNS entries.

## Requirements

At time of writing, this change pushes the requirement of the `ssl` PyPI *package* for 2.5+, as 2.6+ contains the built-in `ssl` *module*.

## Usage

### Disabling SSL Certificate Check

Setting **VERIFY\_SSL\_CERT** to False is currently the default behavior of 0.4.1-dev. This will likely change in future versions.

```

import libcloud.security
libcloud.security.VERIFY_SSL_CERT = False

```

When this value is false, it emits a UserWarning:

{{{#!bash libcloud/httplib\_ssl.py:55: UserWarning: SSL certificate verification is disabled, this can pose a security risk. For more information how to enable the SSL certificate verification, please visit the libcloud documentation.

### Enabling SSL Certificate Check

```

import libcloud.security
libcloud.security.VERIFY_SSL_CERT = True

# optionally, add to CA_CERTS_PATH
libcloud.security.CA_CERTS_PATH.append("/path/to/your/cacerts.txt")

```

**CA\_CERTS\_PATH** contains common paths to CA bundle installations on the following platforms:

* **openssl** on CentOS/Fedora
* **ca-certificates** on Debian/Ubuntu/Arch/Gentoo
* **ca\_root\_nss** on FreeBSD
* **curl-ca-bundle** on Mac OS X

## Example Failure Scenarios

### Missing Valid Certificate Authority

When a valid CA cannot be found in **CA\_CERTS\_PATH**, one may see the following stacktrace:

{{{#!bash libcloud/httplib\_ssl.py:75: UserWarning: Warning: No CA Certificates were found in CA\_CERTS\_PATH. Toggling VERIFY\_SSL\_CERT to False.

warnings.warn(libcloud.security.CA\_CERTS\_UNAVAILABLE\_MSG)

}}}

### Certificate Hostname Mismatch Failure

When the hostname does not match the certificate, an SSLError exception is raised.

To manually test, one can edit the HOSTS file to point a Provider API hostname to another SSL-enabled site, and the result should be:

{{{#!bash

File "libcloud/httplib\_ssl.py", line 99, in connect

raise ssl.SSLError('Failed to verify hostname') ssl.SSLError: Failed to verify hostname

}}}

## Miscellaneous

### OS X: Batteries Not Included

The current issue with OS X root certificates is that they're stored in the Keychain format, unlike the standard PEM format available on other \*nix platforms.

### Acquiring CA Certificates

If the above packages are unavailable to you, and you don't wish to roll your own, the makers of cURL provides an excellent resource, generated from Mozilla: <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html>

## Feedback

Any feedback, please send to the mailing list at libcloud@incubator.apache.org or the JIRA at <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD>.

#### Description

this python project is vulnerable to MITM as it fails to verify the ssl validity of the remote destination.

urllib / urllib2, httplib.SHTTPConnection do not verify ssl at all by default.

from base.py

class ConnectionKey(object):

""" A Base Connection class to derive from.

""" conn\_classes = (httplib.HTTPConnection, httplib.HTTPSConnection)

.... def connect(self, host=None, port=None):

..... connection = self.conn\_classesself.secure

this request can be MITMed leading to the compromise of a users API key - where a secured https connection was requested, but can be MITM'ed.
