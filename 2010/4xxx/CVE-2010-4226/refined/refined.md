{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `cpio` utility, when used to extract RPM packages, is vulnerable to a symlink attack. A malicious RPM package containing a specially crafted symlink could cause `cpio` to overwrite arbitrary files on the system during extraction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of symlinks during archive extraction.",
      "Use of an insecure utility (`cpio`) for extracting untrusted archives."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This could lead to data corruption, denial of service, or, potentially, arbitrary code execution if critical system files are overwritten with malicious content.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker crafts a malicious RPM package that includes a symlink that points to a sensitive file on the target system."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create a malicious RPM package.",
      "Ability to make the malicious RPM available to the vulnerable system for extraction (either as a user, or as an action performed by the vulnerable system)"
    ],
      "additional_details": "This vulnerability exists in `cpio` versions 2007.05.10, 2010.07.28, and possibly other versions. The vulnerability was addressed in SUSE products by replacing cpio with bsdtar in the build scripts used for extracting untrusted rpm packages for bootstrapping virtual machines"
