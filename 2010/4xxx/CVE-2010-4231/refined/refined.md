- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Camtron CMNC-200 IP Camera's built-in web server is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The web server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when accessing files, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system using ".." sequences in the requested URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read any file on the camera's file system, including critical files such as `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`, which could contain sensitive information such as user credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with directory traversal sequences in the URL. Example: `GET /../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable camera's web server and does not require any authentication.
