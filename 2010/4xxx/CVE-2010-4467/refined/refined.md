  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to multiple flaws in the Java Development Kit (JDK) that is bundled with HP Network Node Manager i (NNMi).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and other components such as Deployment, Sound, Swing, HotSpot, JAXP, 2D, Java Language, JDBC, Launcher, Networking, XML Digital Signature, and Java DB."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to remote unauthorized information disclosure, modification of data, or a denial-of-service condition. In some cases, it could also allow for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation through network access, typically through untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets.",
      "Exploitation by supplying malicious data to vulnerable APIs in affected components, including web services.",
     "Local exploitation by running standalone applications (in some specific cases)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system and the ability to deliver malicious Java applets or crafted data to the affected components.
