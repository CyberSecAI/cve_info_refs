Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-4873:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the `confirm.php` file of WeBid 0.8.5P1, specifically when processing the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the application, which could lead to:
    - Execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser.
    - Theft of session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `id` parameter.
- The victim clicks the malicious link, causing the server to reflect the XSS payload back to the victim's browser which then executes the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the crafted URL.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable parameter: `id` parameter in `confirm.php`
- Vulnerable software: WeBid 0.8.5P1
- PoC: `http://localhost/webid/confirm.php?id=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(0)%3C/script%3E`

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3, with an exploitability subscore of 8.6.
- The attack complexity is considered medium due to the need to trick the user into clicking the crafted URL.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by John Leitch.
