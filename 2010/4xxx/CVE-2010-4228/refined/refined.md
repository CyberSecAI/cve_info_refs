    "description": "This document describes various bug fixes and feature enhancements for the NetWare FTP Server (NWFTPD.NLM), including a fix for a buffer overflow vulnerability. The specific vulnerability is described as: 'FTP clients (authenticated or anonymous) could submit certain lengthy commands which might overflow NWFTPD's command buffer, corrupt the stack, and abend individual FTP session threads.'",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation of FTP commands within the NWFTPD.NLM module.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Lack of Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to the crashing of individual FTP session threads and potentially require a system restart in severe cases. It could also enable arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted, overly long FTP commands.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Authenticated or anonymous FTP users can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server and send commands."

    "description": "This advisory from the Zero Day Initiative provides a concise summary of the vulnerability and its impact, along with mitigation information.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the processing of DELE command arguments within the NWFTPD.NLM module. The application copies user-supplied data to a fixed-length stack buffer without proper bounds checking.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via crafted DELE commands.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
