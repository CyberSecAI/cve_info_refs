Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-4655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the improper clearing of heap memory by several `ethtool` functions in the Linux kernel. Specifically, functions like `ethtool_get_rxfh_indir`, `ethtool_get_rx_ntuple`, and potentially others, allocated heap memory but did not clear its contents before returning it to user space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Information Leak:** The primary weakness is that the allocated heap memory could contain sensitive or arbitrary data from previous kernel operations. This uninitialized data is then copied back to user space.
- **Missing Zeroing:** The vulnerability arises from a lack of `kzalloc` or explicit memory clearing (`memset`) before copying heap data to user space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges can potentially read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy. The content of the leaked memory is dependent on previous kernel operations and could expose sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **CAP_NET_ADMIN Privilege:** The attacker must possess the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability, which allows them to configure network interfaces.
- **Ethtool IOCTL:** The attacker triggers the vulnerable code path using specific `ethtool` ioctl commands that call the vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the target system.
- **Privileged User:** The attacker must have `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capabilities to utilize vulnerable `ethtool` functionalities.
- **System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands and interact with the kernel via ioctl system calls.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The `ethtool_get_regs()` function used `kmalloc`, which was later changed to `vmalloc` in kernel 2.6.37 to resolve the issue. This shows that not all functions had the same memory handling.
- The `ethtool_get_rxfh_indir` function was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.36-rc1.
- The `ethtool_get_rx_ntuple` function was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.34-rc1.
- The fix involved replacing `kmalloc` with `kzalloc` to zero the memory before use in several locations.
- Patches were released to address this issue in the Linux Kernel, Ubuntu, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which simply states "Kees Cook discovered that some ethtool functions did not correctly clear heap memory. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could exploit this to read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.".
