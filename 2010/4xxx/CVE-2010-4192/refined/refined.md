      "Source": "www.zerodayinitiative.com_8c027ab9_20250124_162820.html",
      "URL": "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-078/",
      "Advisory ID": "ZDI-11-078",
      "CVE ID": "CVE-2010-4192",
      "Publish Date": "2011-02-08"
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root Cause": "The routine responsible for parsing 3D record type 0xFFFFFF88 does not properly validate multiple fields within the structure. If these values are too large, the process can create a faulty allocation. Later, when the rendering routine attempts to use this buffer, memory is corrupted.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation leading to faulty memory allocation.",
        "Buffer corruption."
      ],
       "Impact": "Remote code execution under the context of the user running the browser.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Visiting a malicious web page.",
        "Opening a malicious file."
      ],
       "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure the victim into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file."
    },
      "Affected Products": [
        "Adobe Shockwave Player"
    ]
  }
