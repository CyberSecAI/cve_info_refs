# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2011

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2011

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are cumulative but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 73 new security fixes across all product families listed below.

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below.  The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Products and Versions column.   Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PIN) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2011verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1291877.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1291877.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for your releases.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

                 CVE-2011-0025 CVE-2011-0706

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform.

CVE-2010-4351
    The JNLP SecurityManager returns from the checkPermission method
    instead of throwing an exception in certain circumstances, which
    might allow context-dependent attackers to bypass the intended
    security policy by creating instances of ClassLoader.

CVE-2010-4448
    Malicious applets can perform DNS cache poisoning.

CVE-2010-4450
    An empty (but set) LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable results in
    a misconstructed library search path, resulting in code execution
    from possibly untrusted sources.

CVE-2010-4465
    Malicious applets can extend their privileges by abusing Swing
    timers.

CVE-2010-4469
    The Hotspot just-in-time compiler miscompiles crafted byte
    sequences, resulting in heap corruption.

CVE-2010-4470
    JAXP can be exploited by untrusted code to elevate privileges.

CVE-2010-4471
    Java2D can be exploited by untrusted code to elevate privileges.

CVE-2010-4472
    Untrusted code can replace the XML DSIG implementation.

CVE-2011-0025
    Signatures on JAR files are not properly verified, which allows
    remote attackers to trick users into executing code that appears
    to come from a trusted source.

CVE-2011-0706
    The JNLPClassLoader class allows remote attackers to gain
    privileges via unknown vectors related to multiple signers and the
    assignment of "an inappropriate security descriptor

In addition, this security update contains stability fixes, such as
switching to the recommended Hotspot version (hs14) for this
particular version of OpenJDK.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.7-2~lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.7-2~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.8.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.

# Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory - February 2011

## Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory - February 2011

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE and Java for Business also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes across Java SE and Java for Business products.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below.  Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

| Java SE | Patch Availability |
| --- | --- |
| JDK and JRE 6 Update 23 and earlier for Windows, Solaris, and Linux | [Java SE](/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) |
| JDK 5.0 Update 27 and earlier for Solaris 9 | [Java SE](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=448048756028702&id=1231283.1) |
| SDK 1.4.2\_29 and earlier for Solaris 8 | [Java SE](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=448048756028702&id=1231283.1) |

| JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 27 and earlier for Windows, Solaris and Linux | Java for Business |
| SDK and JRE 1.4.2\_29 and earlier for Windows, Solaris and Linux | Java for Business |

### Patch Availability Table and Risk Matrix

Java SE and Java for Business fixes in this Update are cumulative; the latest Critical Patch Update includes all fixes from the previous Critical Patch Updates.

#### Patch Availability Table

| Product Group | Risk Matrix | Patch Availability and Installation Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle Java SE and Java for Business | [Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Risk Matrix](#AppendixJAVA) | Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update February 2011 [My Oracle Support Note 1282490.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=447945977433634&id=1282490.1) Consumer users of Oracle Java SE can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows platform can also use [automatic updates](//www.java.com/en/download/help/5000020700.xml) to get the latest release |

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. Hence Oracle recommends that customers upgrade their Oracle products to a supported version.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle: Afik Castiel from Versafe Anti Fraud; Billy Rios of Google; binaryproof via Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative; binaryproof via iDefense; Dmitri Gribenko; Eduardo Vela Nava of Google; Frederic Hoguin via Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative; Marc Schoenefeld of Red Hat; Peter Csepely via Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative; Roee Hay and Yair Amit of IBM Rational Application Security Research Group; Sami Koivu via Tipping Point's Zero Day Initiative; Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security; and Tom Hawtin.

### Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Schedule

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE and Java for Business

#### Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 21 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE and Java for Business.  19 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.

CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). Where the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", and the corresponding CVSS Base score is 7.5 instead of 10 respectively.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?_afrLoop=447848896303929&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include a JDK.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
