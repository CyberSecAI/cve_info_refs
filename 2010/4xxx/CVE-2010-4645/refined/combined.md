The pitfalls of verifying ﬂoating-point
computations

Abstract

Current critical systems often use a lot of ﬂoating-point computations,
and thus the testing or static analysis of programs containing ﬂoating-
point operators has become a priority. However, correctly deﬁning the
semantics of common implementations of ﬂoating-point is tricky, because
semantics may change according to many factors beyond source-code level,
such as choices made by compilers. We here give concrete examples of
problems that can appear and solutions for implementing in analysis soft-
ware.

Introduction

In the past, critical applications often used ﬁxed-point computations. However,
with the wide availability of processors with hardware ﬂoating-point units, many
current critical applications (say, for controlling automotive or aerospace sys-
tems) use ﬂoating-point operations. Such applications have to undergo stringent
testing or validation. In this paper, we show how the particularities of ﬂoating-
point implementations can hinder testing methodologies and have to be cared
for in techniques based on program semantics, be them assisted proofs, or au-
tomatic analysers.

It has been known for a long time that it was erroneous to compute with
ﬂoating-point numbers and operations as though they were on the real ﬁeld.
There exist entire treatises discussing the topic of stability in numerical al-
gorithms from the point of view of the applied mathematician: whether or
not some algorithm, when implemented with ﬂoating-point, will give “good”
approximations of the real result; we will however not discuss such issues in
this paper. The purpose of this paper is to show the kind of diﬃculties that
ﬂoating-point computations pose for static analysis and program testing meth-
ods: both for deﬁning the semantics of the programs to be analysed, and for
deﬁning and implementing the analysis techniques. We shall not discuss “bugs”
in ﬂoating-point implementations in microprocessors,1 but, rather, how misun-
derstandings and non-intuitive behaviours of correct hardware implementations
aﬀect the safety of programs and program analysis techniques.

Many of the issues that we discuss here are known to ﬂoating-point arith-
metic experts. However, they have often been ignored or misunderstood by de-
signers of programming languages, compilers, veriﬁcation techniques and pro-
gram analysers. Some of them were taken care of, at least partially, in the
deﬁnition of Java and the latest standard for C, as well as modern hardware
implementations. Our primary objective, however, is to educate the designers
of veriﬁcation systems, who in general do not have the luxury to change the
hardware implementation, the programming language, the compilers used or
the algorithms of the systems that they have to verify. Some of the issues we
discuss pertain to the IntelTM 386, i86, PentiumTM lines (IA32TM architecture),
which will most probably continue to be used for embedded work for a number
of years. Because of this focus on program analysis for critical systems, we shall
be particularly interested in programs written in the C programming language,
because this language is often favoured for embedded systems. We shall in par-
ticular discuss some implications of the most recent standard of that language,
“C99” [ISO, 1999]. In order to emphasise that the issues we discuss are real, we
shall give speciﬁc program fragments as well as versions of compilers, libraries
and operating systems with which “surprising” behaviours were witnessed.

All current major microprocessor architectures (IA32, x86 64, PowerPC)
support IEEE-754 ﬂoating-point arithmetic [IEE, 1985], now also an interna-
tional standard [IEC, 1989]; microcontrollers based on these architectures also
do so. Other microcontrollers and microprocessors often implement some variant
of it with some features omitted. The speciﬁcation for the default ﬂoating-point
arithmetic in the Java programming language is also based on IEEE-754. For
these reasons, we shall focus on this standard and its main implementations,
though some of our remarks apply to other kinds of systems. For the sake of a
better understanding, in Section 2, we recall the basics of IEEE-754 arithmetic.
Despite, or perhaps because of, the prevalence of “IEEE-compliant” systems,
there exist a number of myths of what IEEE-compliance really entails from the
point of view of program semantics. We shall discuss the following myths, among
others:

•

•

•

•

“Since C’s float (resp. double) type is mapped to IEEE single (resp.
double) precision arithmetic, arithmetic operations have a uniquely de-
ﬁned meaning across platforms.”

“Arithmetic operations are deterministic; that is, if I do z=x+y in two
places in the same program and my program never touches x and y in the
meantime, then the results should be the same.”

A variant: “If x < 1 tests true at one point, then x < 1 stays true later
if I never modify x.”

“The same program, strictly compliant with the C standard with no “un-
deﬁned behaviours”, should yield identical results if compiled on the same
IEEE-compliant platform by diﬀerent compliant compilers.”

A well-known cause for such unintuitive discrepancies is the 80-bit internal
ﬂoating-point registers on the Intel platform. [Sun, 2001, Appendix D] In Sec-
tion 3.1, we shall expand on such issues and show, for instance, how low-level
issues such as register allocation [Appel and Ginsburg, 1997, chapter 11] and
the insertion of logging instructions with no “apparent” computational eﬀects

2

can change the ﬁnal results of computations. In Section 3.2 we shall discuss
issues pertaining to the PowerPC architecture.

An important factor throughout the discussion is that it is not the hardware
platform that matters in itself, but its combination with the software context,
including the compiler, libraries, and possible run-time environment. Compat-
ibility has to be appreciated at the level of the application writer — how code
written using types mapped to IEEE normalised formats will eﬀectively behave
when compiled and run. Indeed, the standard recalls [IEC, 1989, IEE, 1985,
1.1]:

§

It is the environment the programmer or user of the system sees that
conforms or fails to conform to this standard. Hardware components that
require software support to conform shall not be said to conform apart
from such software.

IEEE-754 standardises a few basic operations; however, many programs use
functions such as sine, cosine, . . . , which are not speciﬁed by this standard and
are generally not strictly speciﬁed in the system documentation. In Section 4,
In
we shall explore some diﬃculties with respect to mathematical libraries.
addition to issues related to certain ﬂoating-point implementations, or certain
mathematical libraries, there are issues more particularly related to the C pro-
gramming language, its compilers and libraries. Section 4.3 explores such system
dependencies. Section 4.4 explores issues with input and output of ﬂoating-point
values.

A commonly held opinion is that whatever the discrepancies, they will be
negligible enough and should not have noticeable consequences. In Section 5,
we give a complete example of some seemingly innocuous ﬂoating-point code
fragment based on real-life industrial code. We illustrate how the ﬂoating-point
“oddities” that we explained in the preceding sections can lead to rare and
extremely hard to diagnose run-time errors.

While the focus of the paper is on the C programming language, in Section 6
we shall discuss a few aspects of the compilation of Java, a language reputedly
more “predictable”, which many advocate for use in embedded systems.

While in most of the paper we dismiss some incorrectly optimistic beliefs
about how ﬂoating-point computations behave and what one can safely sup-
pose about them for program analysis, an opposite misconception exists: that
ﬂoating-point is inherently so complex and tricky that it is impossible to do any
kind of sound analysis, or do any kind of sound reasoning, on programs using
ﬂoating-point, except perhaps in very simple cases. By sound analysis (Sec. 7.2),
we mean that when one analyses the program in order to prove properties (say,
“variable x does not exceed 42), using some automated, semi-automated or
manual proof techniques, then the results that are obtained truly hold of the
concrete system (e.g. one does not prove the above statement when in reality
x can reach 42.000000001). The Astr´ee static analyser2 implements mathe-
matically sound analyses by taking into account some “error bounds” derived
2Astr´ee is a static analyser specialised on a subset of C suitable for many critical ap-
plications.
It features speciﬁc, sound and precise analyses for ﬂoating-point digital ﬁlters.
It was successfully applied to several classes of critical code, especially ﬂy-by-wire software.
See http://www.astree.ens.fr as well as [Blanchet et al., 2002, 2003, Cousot et al., 2005].
Simply put, Astr´ee takes as input the source code of a program, a speciﬁcation of bounds
on program inputs, and computes, symbolically, a super-set of reachable program states and
possible program executions, from which it extracts properties interesting to the user, and

3

from the speciﬁcation of the concrete ﬂoating-point semantics. The existence
of Astr´ee and its use in an industrial context demonstrate that it is possible
to obtain sound analyses with a reasonable cost, at least for some classes of
applications. We shall therefore refer to this tool as a practical example further
on.

In Section 7 we analyse the consequences of the issues discussed in previous
sections on abstract interpretation-based static analysis and other validation
techniques, and show how to obtain sound results.

IEEE-754: a reminder

All current general-purpose microprocessors, and many microcontrollers, imple-
ment hardware ﬂoating-point as a variant of standard ANSI/IEEE-754 [IEE,
1985], later adopted as international standard IEC-60559 [IEC, 1989]. We thus
begin by an overview of this standard. We shall not, however, describe how algo-
rithms can make clever use of the standard for numerical computation purposes,
and refer the reader to papers and presentations from e.g. William Kahan3 on
such issues.

2.1 Numbers

IEEE ﬂoating point numbers are of the following kinds:

Zeroes There exist both a +0 and a

0. Most operations behave identically
regardless of the sign of the zero, however one gets diﬀerent results if one
extracts the sign bit from the number, or if one divides a nonzero number
by a zero (the sign of the zero and that of the nonzero other operand
determine whether +

is returned).

or

−

∞

−∞

Many programs do not depend on this feature of IEEE arithmetic and
would behave identically if only a single zero was provided. This is the
case of most programs implementing real (as opposed to complex) com-
putations. However, discriminating between +0 and
0 allows for some
−
simpler implementations of certain classes of algorithms.

±

An important example of the use for separate
0 is complex arith-
metic [Kahan, 1987]: if branch cuts are located along the real or complex
axes, then distinguishing +0 and
0 allow making functions continuous
from both sides of the slit, while having a single zero value introduces a
log(z) with z = x + iy, x < 0:
discontinuity. As an example, consider
limy→0+
π, and thus
it makes sense to deﬁne by continuity from both sides: log(x + 0i) = +π
and log(x
π. This behaviour of complex arithmetic along branch
cuts is mandated by the C99 standard [ISO, 1999,

Normal numbers (Also known as normalised numbers.) These are the most

common kind of nonzero representable reals.

Subnormal numbers (Also known as denormalised numbers or denormals.)
These represent some values very close to zero. They pose special issues
regarding rounding errors.

IEEE speciﬁes 5 possible kinds of exceptions. These exceptions can, at the

request of the programmer, be substituted for “silent” default responses:

Invalid operation This is the exception corresponding to the conditions pro-

ducing a NaN as silent response.

Overﬂow This exception is raised when the result of an operation is a number
too large in magnitude to be represented in the data type. The silent
response is to generate

Underﬂow This exception is raised when a result is too small in magnitude to
be computed accurately. This is generally harmless in programs; however,
care must be taken when computing error bounds on ﬂoating-point com-
putations, because error bounds on underﬂow diﬀer from those on normal
computations (see below).

Inexact The “real” result of a computation cannot be exactly represented by a
ﬂoating-point number. The silent response is to round the number, which
is a behaviour that the vast majority of programs using ﬂoating-point
numbers rely upon. However, rounding has to be correctly taking into
account for sound analysis.

In typical critical embedded critical programs, invalid operations, divisions
by zero, and overﬂows are undesirable conditions. In such systems, inputs vary
within controlled ranges, many variables model physical quantities (which also
should lie within some reasonable range), and thus NaNs and
should not
appear. This is especially true since inﬁnities may generate NaNs down the line
(e.g. (+
) = N aN ), NaNs propagate throughout the algorithms, and
converting a NaN to an output quantity (conversion to integer after scaling, for
instance) yields an undeﬁned result. For this reason, in most critical embedded
systems, the generation of a NaN or inﬁnity is an undesirable condition, which
the designers of the system will want to rule out, including through formal
methods (see Sec. 7). The invalid operation, overﬂow and division by zero
exceptions may be activated, so that they are raised as soon as an undesirable
result is computed. They may trigger the termination of the program, or the
running of a “degraded” version of it with limited functionality or complexity.
This is why one of the features of analysers such as Astr´ee is to detect where
in programs such exceptions may be raised. In order to achieve this goal, the

5

analyser will have to bound variables and results of ﬂoating-point operations,
which requires some sound analysis techniques and motivates this paper.

Floating point numbers are represented as follows: x =

for a given number if we impose that the leftmost digit of the mantissa is 1 —
this is called a normalised representation. Except in the case of numbers of very
small magnitude, IEEE-754 always works with normalised representations.

Hexadecimal ﬂoating-point representations are especially important when val-
ues must be represented exactly, for reproducible results — for instance, for
testing “borderline cases” in algorithms. For this reason, we shall use them in
this paper wherever it is important to specify exact values. See also Section 4.4
for more information on inputting and outputting ﬂoating-point values.

§

2.2 Rounding

Each real number x is mapped to a ﬂoating-point value r(x) by a uniquely de-
ﬁned rounding function; the choice of this function is determined by the rounding
mode.

Generally, ﬂoating-point units and libraries allow the program to change
the current rounding mode; C99 mandates fegetround() and fesetround()
to respectively get and set the current rounding mode on IEEE-compliant plat-
forms. Other platforms (BSD etc.) provide fpgetround() and fpsetround().
Finally, on some other platforms, it may be necessary to use assembly language
instructions that directly change the mode bits inside the ﬂoating-point unit.4
IEEE-754 mandates four standard rounding modes:

•

Round-to-+
value greater than or equal to x.

(directed rounding to +

∞

): r(x) is the least ﬂoating point

4The Astr´ee static analyser, which uses directed rounding internally as described in
Sec. 7.5, contains a module that strives to provide a way of changing rounding modes on
most current, common platforms. We regret the uneven support of the standardised func-
tions.

Round-to-nearest: r(x) is the ﬂoating-point value closest to x with the

with diﬀerent precisions twice in a row (say, ﬁrst to double precision, then
to single precision) may yield diﬀerent results than rounding directly to
the ﬁnal type; this is known as double rounding. Some implications of
double-rounding are investigated in Sec. 3.1.2.

The default mode is round-to-nearest, and this is the only one used in the

vast majority of programs.

The discussion on ﬂoating-point errors frequently refers to the notion of “unit
in the last place” or “ulp”; but there are diﬀerent deﬁnitions of this notion, with

This relative error characterisation is used in some papers analysing the impact
of roundoﬀ errors. It is, however, incorrect in the context of IEEE-754, where the
range of exponents is bounded: not only there is the possibility of overﬂow, but
there exists a least positive representable number, which introduces an absolute
error for values very close to zero [Min´e, 2004a,
7.4.3][Min´e, 2004b]. As a
result, for any ﬂoating-point type with a bounded number of bits, there exist
two positive reals εrel and εabs such that

§

One diﬃculty, when reasoning about ﬂoating-point computations, both with
human and automated reasoning, is that ﬂoating-point operations “almost”
behave like their name-sakes on the reals, but not quite exactly. For instance, it
is well-known that ﬂoating-point operations are not associative (e.g (1020
⊖
1020 = 0
1 using IEEE-754 double precision operations).
Many symbolic computation techniques, used in compiler optimisers, program
analysers or proof assistants, assume some good algebraic properties of the
arithmetic in order to be sound; thus, if applied directly and straightforwardly

on ﬂoating-point operation, they are unsound. Yet, some compilers rely on
such properties to perform optimisations (see 4.3.2). In Section 7.5, we shall
explain how it is possible to make such analysis methods sound with respect to
ﬂoating-point.

3 Architecture-dependent issues

Some commonplace architectures, or, more appropriately, some commonplace
ways of compiling programs and using ﬂoating-point programs on certain com-
monplace architectures, can introduce subtle inconsistencies between program
executions.

3.1 IA32, x86 64 architectures

The IA32 architecture, originating from Intel, encompasses processors such as
the i386, i486 and the various Pentium variants. It was until recently the most
common architecture for personal computers, but has since been superseded
for that usage by the x86 64 architecture, a 64-bit extension of IA32.5 IA32,
however, is a very commonplace architecture for embedded systems, including
with embedded variants of the i386 and i486 processors.
IA32 oﬀers almost
complete upward compatibility from the 8086 processor, ﬁrst released in 1978; it
features a ﬂoating-point unit, often nicknamed x87, mostly upwardly compatible
with the 8087 coprocessor, ﬁrst released in 1980.

Later, another ﬂoating-point unit, known as SSE, was added to the archi-
tecture, with full support for IEEE-754 starting from the Pentium 4 processor;
it is now the preferred unit to use. The use of the x87 unit is deprecated on
x86 64 — for instance, the popular gcc compiler does not use it by default
on this platform, and the documentation for Microsoft Visual Studio C++ on
x86 64 calls this unit “legacy ﬂoating-point”. However, microcontrollers and
embedded microprocessors are likely not to include this SSE unit in the years
to come, even if they include x87 hardware ﬂoating-point.

3.1.1 x87 ﬂoating-point unit

Processors of the IA32 architecture (Intel 386, 486, Pentium etc. and com-
patibles) feature a ﬂoating-point unit often known as “x87” [Int, 2005, chapter
8].

It supports the ﬂoating-point, integer, and packed BCD integer data
types and the ﬂoating-point processing algorithms and exception handling
architecture deﬁned in the IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point
Arithmetic.

This unit has 80-bit registers in “double extended” format (64-bit mantissa
and 15-bit exponent), often associated to the long double C type; IEEE-754
speciﬁes the possibility of such a format. The unit can read and write data

5AMD made a 64-bit architecture called AMD64TM. Intel then produced a mostly com-
patible architecture, calling it Intel r
64 (not to be confused with IA64TM, another, incom-
(cid:13)
patible, 64-bit architecture from Intel, found in the ItaniumTM processor), after brieﬂy calling
it EM64TTM. Microsoft Windows documentation calls these architectures x64. We chose a
middle ground and followed the terminology of GNU/Linux distributions (x86 64).

to memory in this 80-bit format or in standard IEEE-754 single and double
precision.

By default, all operations performed on CPU registers are done with 64-bit
precision, but it is possible to reduce precision to 24-bit (same as IEEE sin-
gle precision) and 53-bit (same as IEEE double precision) mantissas by setting
some bits in the unit’s control register.[Int, 2005,
8.1.5.2] These precision set-
tings, however, do not aﬀect the range of exponents available, and only aﬀect a
limited subset of operations (containing all operations speciﬁed in IEEE-754).
As a result, changing these precisions settings will not result in ﬂoating-point
operations being performed in strict IEEE-754 single or double precision.6

§

The most usual way of generating code for the IA32 is to hold temporaries —
and, in optimised code, program variables — in the x87 registers. Doing so yields
more compact and eﬃcient code than always storing register values into memory
and reloading them. However, it is not always possible to do everything inside
registers, and compilers then generally spill extra temporary values to main
memory,
[Appel and Ginsburg, 1997, chapter 11] using the format associated
to the type associated to the value by the typing rules of the language. For
instance, a double temporary will be spilt to a 64-bit double precision memory
cell. This means that the ﬁnal result of the computations depend on how the
compiler allocates registers, since temporaries (and possibly variables) will incur
or not incur rounding whether or not they are spilt to main memory.

As an example, the following program compiled with gcc 4.0.1 [Fre, 2005b]

under Linux will print 10308 (1E308):

double v = 1E308;
double x = (v * v) / v;
printf("%g %d\n", x, x==v);

, and the ﬁnal result should be +

How is that possible? v * v done in double precision will overﬂow, and thus
yield +
. However, since all computations
are performed in extended precision, with a larger exponent range, the compu-
tations do not overﬂow. If we use the -ffloat-store option, which forces gcc
to store ﬂoating-point variables in memory, we obtain +

∞

∞

The result of computations can actually depend on compilation options or
compiler versions, or anything that aﬀects propagation. With the same compiler
and system, the following program prints 10308 (when compiled in optimised
mode (-O), while it prints +

when compiled in default mode.

.
∞

∞

double foo(double v) {

double y = v * v;
return (y / v);

}

main() { printf("%g\n", foo(1E308));}

Examination of the assembly code shows that when optimising, the compiler
reuses the value of y stored in a register, while it saves and reloads y to and
from main memory in non-optimised mode.

6By “strict IEEE-754 behaviour”, “strict IEEE-754 single precision” or “strict IEEE-754
double precision”, we mean that each individual basic arithmetic operation is performed as if
the computation were done over the real numbers, then the result rounded to single or double

tions that should be inlined (however, compilers are free to inline or not to
inline such functions; they may also inline other functions when it is safe to
do so). However, on x87, whether or not inlining is performed may change the
semantics of the code!

Consider what gcc 4.0.1 on IA32 does with the following program, depending

on whether the optimisation switch -O is passed:

static inline double f(double x) {

return x/1E308;

}

double square(double x) {

double y = x*x;
return y;

}

int main(void) {

printf("%g\n", f(square(1E308)));

}

gcc does not inline functions when optimisation is turned oﬀ. The square
function returns a double, but the calling convention is to return ﬂoating point
values into a x87 register — thus in long double format. Thus, when square
is called, it returns approximately 10716, which ﬁts in long double but not
double format. But when f is called, the parameter is passed on the stack —
thus as a double, +
. In comparison, if the
program is compiled with optimisation on, f is inlined; no parameter passing
takes place, thus no conversion to double before division, and thus the ﬁnal
result printed is 10308.

. The program therefore prints +

It is somewhat common for beginners to add a comparison check to 0 before
computing a division, in order to avoid possible division-by-zero exceptions or
the generation of inﬁnite results. A ﬁrst objection to this practise is that, any-
way, computing 1/x for x very close to zero will generate very large numbers
that will most probably result in overﬂows later. Indeed, programmers lack-
ing experience with ﬂoating-point are advised that they should hardly ever use
strict comparison tests (=,
) with ﬂoating-
point operands, as it is somewhat pointless to exclude some singularity point by
excluding one single value, since it will anyway be surrounded by mathematical
instability or at least very large values which will break the algorithms. Another
objection, which few programmers know about and that we wish to draw at-
tention to, is that it may actually fail to work, depending on what the compiler
does — that is, the program may actually test that x
= 0, then, further down,
ﬁnd that x = 0 without any apparent change to x. How can this be possible?

if (z != 0) {

This program exhibits diﬀerent behaviours depending on various factors,

even when one uses the same compiler (gcc version 4.0.2 on IA32):

If it is compiled without optimisation, x / y is computed as a long
double then converted into a IEEE-754 double precision number (0) in
order to be saved into memory variable z, which is then reloaded from
memory for the test. The if statement is thus not taken.

If it is compiled as a single source code with optimisation, gcc performs
some kind of global analysis which understands that do_nothing does
nothing. Then, it does constant propagation, sees that z is 0, thus that
the if statement is not taken, and ﬁnally that main() performs no side
eﬀect. It then eﬀectively compiles main() as a “no operation”.

If it is compiled as two source codes (one for each function) with opti-
misation, gcc is not able to use information about what do_nothing()
does when compiling main().
It will thus generate two function calls
to do_nothing(), and will not assume that the value of y (respectively,
z) is conserved across do_nothing(&y) (respectively, do_nothing(&z)).
The z != 0 test is performed on a nonzero long double quantity and
thus the test is taken. However, after the do_nothing(&z) function call,
z is reloaded from main memory as the value 0 (because conversion to
double-precision ﬂushed it to 0). As a consequence, the ﬁnal assertion
fails, somehow contrary to what many programmers would expect.

One should therefore be extra careful with strict comparisons, because the
comparison may be performed on extended precision values, and fail to hold later
after the values have been converted to single or double precision — which may
happen or not depending on a variety of factors including compiler optimisations
and “no-operation” statements.

We are surprised by these discrepancies. After all, the C speciﬁcation says

[ISO, 1999, 5.1.2.3, program execution,

12, ex. 4]:

§

Implementations employing wide registers have to take care to hon-
our appropriate semantics. Values are independent of whether they are

11

represented in a register or in memory. For example, an implicit spilling
of a register is not permitted to alter the value. Also, an explicit store
and load is required to round to the precision of the storage type.

However, this paragraph, being an example, is not normative. [ISO, 1999, fore-
word,
6]. By reading the C speciﬁcation more generally, one gets the impression
that such hidden side-eﬀects (“hidden”, that is, not corresponding to program
statements) are prohibited.

§

The above examples indicate that common debugging practises that appar-
ently should not change the computational semantics may actually alter the
result of computations. Adding a logging statement in the middle of a compu-
tation may alter the scheduling of registers, for instance by forcing some value to
be spilt into main memory and thus undergo additional rounding. As an exam-
ple, simply inserting a printf("%g\n", y); call after the computation of y in

ments which are not supposed to aﬀect the state of the variables.

In addition, it is commonplace to disable optimisation when one intends to
use a software debugger, because in optimised code, the compiled code corre-
sponding to distinct statements may become fused, variables may not reside
in a well-deﬁned location, etc. However, as we have seen, simply disabling or
enabling optimisation may change computational results.

3.1.2 Double rounding

In some circumstances, ﬂoating-point results are rounded twice in a row, ﬁrst
to a type A then to a type B. Surprisingly, such double rounding can yield
diﬀerent results from direct rounding to the destination type.7 Such is the case,
for instance, of results computed in the long double 80-bit type of the x87
ﬂoating-point registers, then rounded to the IEEE double precision type for
storage in memory. In round-to-0, round-to-+
modes, this
is not a problem provided that the values representable by type B are a subset
of those representable by type A. However, in round-to-nearest mode, there
exist some borderline cases where diﬀerences are exhibited.

and round-to-

−∞

∞

In order to deﬁne the round-to-nearest mode, one has to deﬁne arbitrarily
how to round a real exactly in the middle between the nearest ﬂoating-point
values. IEEE-754 chooses round-to-even [IEC, 1989, IEE, 1985,

4.1]:8

§

In this mode, the representable value nearest to the inﬁnitely precise
result shall be delivered; if the two nearest representable values are equally
near, the one with its least signiﬁcant bit equal to zero shall be delivered.

This deﬁnition makes it possible for double rounding to yield diﬀerent results
than single rounding to the destination type. Consider a ﬂoating-point type B
where two consecutive values are x0 and x0 + δB, and another ﬂoating-type A
containing all values in B and also x0 + δB/2. There exists δA > 0 such that all
δA/2, x0 + δB/2) get rounded to x0 + δB/2
reals in the interval I = (x0 + δB/2

7This problem has been known for a long time.[Figueroa del Cid, 2000,

double x0 = 0x1.0000000000001p0;

double z1 = x0 + y;
double z2 = (long double) x0 + (long double) y;
printf("%a %a\n", z1, z2);

In order to get strict IEEE-754 double precision computations for the double
type, we execute double-precision computations on the SSE unit (see Sec-
tion 3.1.3) of an x86 64 or Pentium 4 processor. We then obtain that z1 = x0
and that z2 = x0 + 2−52: both z1 and z2 are double values obtained by ap-
parently identical computations (the sum of x0 and y), but the value that z2
holds will have been doubly rounded (ﬁrst to extended precision, then to double
precision for storing to z2) while z1 holds a value directly rounded to double
precision.

Note that, on IA32, depending on compilation modes, the above discrepancy
may disappear, with both values undergoing double rounding: on IA32 Linux
/ gcc-4.0.1 with default options, the computations on double will be actually
performed in the long double type inside the x87 unit, then converted to IEEE
double precision. There is thus no diﬀerence between the formulae computing
z1 and z2.

Another example was reported as a bug by a user who noticed inconsistencies

between 387 and SSE but did not identify the source of the problem:

double b = 0x1.fffffffffffffp-1;
double x = 1 / b;

Let ε = 2−53, then b = 1
ε. 1/b = 1 + ε + ε2 + . . . ; the nearest double
precision numbers are 1 and 1 + 2ε and thus direct rounding gives x = 1 + 2ε.
However, rounding to extended precision will give 1 + ε, which is rounded to 1
when converting to double precision.

A similar problem occurs with rounding behaviour near inﬁnities: see the

3.1.3 SSE ﬂoating-point unit

Intel introduced the SSE ﬂoating-point unit [Int, 2005, chapter 10] in the
Pentium III processor, then the SSE2 extension in the Pentium 4 [Int, 2005,
chapter 11]. These extensions to the x86 instruction set contain, respectively,
IEEE-compatible single-precision and double-precision instructions.9 One can
make gcc generate code for the SSE subsystem with the -mfpmath=sse option;
since SSE is only available for certain processors, it is also necessary to specify,
for instance, -march=pentium4. On x86 64, -mfpmath=sse is the default, but
-mfpmath=387 forces the use of the x87 unit.

Note the implication: the same program may give diﬀerent results when
compiled on 32-bit and 64-bit “PCs” (or even the same machine, depending on
whether one compiles in 32-bit or 64-bit mode) because of the diﬀerence in the
default ﬂoating-point subsystem used.

The diﬀerences may seem academic, but the following incident proves they
are not. The Objective Caml system [Leroy et al., 2005] includes two compil-
ers: one compiles Caml code into a portable bytecode, executed by a virtual
machine (this virtual machine is written in C); the other one compiles directly
to native assembly code. One user of Objective Caml on the recent Intel-based
Apple Macintosh computers complained of a mysterious “bug” to the Caml
maintainers: the same program gave slightly diﬀerent results across the byte-
code and native code versions. The problem could not be reproduced on other
platforms, such as Linux on the same kind of processors. It turned out that, as
all Intel-based Macintosh machines have a SSE unit, Apple conﬁgured gcc to
use the SSE unit by default. As a consequence, on this platform, by default,
the Objective Caml virtual machine uses the SSE unit when executing bytecode
performing ﬂoating-point computations: for instance, an isolated ﬂoating-point
addition will be performed as a sequence of two loads from double-precision
operands, addition with the result in a double-precision register, and then save
to a double-precision variable. The native code compiler, however, uses the x87
unit: the same ﬂoating-point addition is thus performed as a sequence of two
loads from double-precision operands, addition with the result in an extended-
precision register, and then save to a double-precision variable. As we pointed

9In addition to scalar instructions, SSE and SSE2 introduce various vector instructions,
that is, instructions operating over several operands in parallel. We shall see in
4.3.2 that
§
compilers may rearrange expressions incorrectly in order to take advantage of these vector
instructions. For now, we only discuss the scalar instructions.

14

out in the preceding section, these two sequences of operations are not equiv-
alent in the default round-to-nearest mode, due to double rounding. It turned
out that the user had stumbled upon a value resulting in double rounding. The
widespread lack of awareness of ﬂoating-point issues resulted in the user blaming
the discrepancy on a bug in Objective Caml!

§

In addition, the SSE unit oﬀers some non-IEEE-754 compliant modes for
better eﬃciency: with the ﬂush-to-zero ﬂag [Int, 2005,
10.2.3.3] on, subnormals
are not generated and are replaced by zeroes; this is more eﬃcient. As we
noted in Section 2.2, this does not hamper obtaining good bounds on the errors
introduced by ﬂoating-point computations; also, we can assume the worst-case
situation and suppose that this ﬂag is on when we derive error bounds.
The ﬂush-to-zero ﬂag, however, has another notable consequence: x

y = 0
is no longer equivalent to x = y. As an example, if x = 2−1022 and y =
x = 2−1023 in normal mode, and y

x = 0 in ﬂush-to-zero
mode. Analysers should therefore be careful when replacing comparisons by
“equivalent” comparisons.

In addition, there exists a denormals-are-zero ﬂag [Int, 2005,

10.2.3.4]: if
it is on, all subnormal operands are considered to be zero, which improves
performance. It is still possible to obtain bounds on the errors of ﬂoating point
computations by assuming that operands are oﬀset by an amount of at most
2emin−(p−1) before being computed upon. However, techniques based on exact
±
replays of instruction sequences will have to replay the sequence with the same
value of the ﬂag.

§

3.1.4 Problems and solutions

We have shown that computations on the float (respectively, double) types
are not performed on the x87 unit exactly as if each atomic arithmetic operation
were performed with IEEE-754 single (respectively, double precision) operands
and result, and that what is actually performed may depend on seemingly irrel-
evant factors such as calls to tracing or printing functions. This goes against the
widespread myth that the result of the evaluation of a ﬂoating-point expression
should be the same across all platforms compatible with IEEE-754.

This discrepancy has long been known to some people in the programming
language community, and some “ﬁxes” have been proposed. For instance, gcc
has a -ffloat-store option, ﬂushing ﬂoating-point variables to memory. [Fre,
2005b] Indeed, the gcc manual [Fre, 2005b] says:

On 68000 and x86 systems, for instance, you can get paradoxical re-
sults if you test the precise values of ﬂoating point numbers. For example,
you can ﬁnd that a ﬂoating point value which is not a NaN is not equal
to itself. This results from the fact that the ﬂoating point registers hold a
few more bits of precision than ﬁt in a double in memory. Compiled code
moves values between memory and ﬂoating point registers at its conve-
nience, and moving them into memory truncates them. You can partially
avoid this problem by using the -ffloat-store option.

The manual refers to the following option:

-ffloat-store Do not store ﬂoating point variables in registers, and
inhibit other options that might change whether a ﬂoating point value is
taken from a register or memory.

15

This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines [. . . ]
where the ﬂoating registers [. . . ] keep more precision than a ‘double’ is
supposed to have. Similarly for the x86 architecture. For most programs,
the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely on the pre-
cise deﬁnition of IEEE ﬂoating point.[sic] Use ‘-ffloat-store’ for such
programs, after modifying them to store all pertinent intermediate com-
putations into variables.

Note that this option does not force unnamed temporaries to be ﬂushed to mem-
ory, as shown by experiments. To our knowledge, no compiler oﬀers the choice
to always spill temporaries to memory, or to ﬂush temporaries to long double
memory, which would at least remove the worst problem, which is the non-
reproducibility of results depending on factors independent of the computation
code (register allocation diﬀerences caused by compiler options or debugging
code, etc.). We suggest that compilers should include such options.

Unfortunately, anyway, systematically ﬂushing values to single- or double-
precision memory cells do not reconstitute strict IEEE-754 single- or double-
precision rounding behaviour in round-to-nearest mode, because of the double
rounding problem (3.1.2). In addition, the -ffloat-store option is diﬃcult
to use, because it only aﬀects program variables and not temporaries: to ap-
proximate strict IEEE-754 behaviour, the programmer would have to rewrite
all program formulae to store temporaries in variables. This does not seem to
be reasonable for human-written code, but may be possible with automatically
generated code — it is frequent that control/command applications are imple-
mented in a high-level language such as Simulink10 Lustre [Caspi et al., 1987]
or ScadeTM,11 then compiled into C [ISO, 1999].

Another possibility is to force the ﬂoating-point unit to limit the width of
the mantissa to that of IEEE-754 basic formats (single or double precision).12
This mostly solves the double-rounding problem. However, there is no way to
constrain the range of the exponents, and thus these modes do not allow exact
simulation of strict computations on IEEE single and double precision formats,
when overﬂows and underﬂows are possible. For instance, the square program
of Sec. 3.1.1, which results in an overﬂow to +
if computations are done on
IEEE double precision numbers, does not result in overﬂows if run with the x87
in double precision mode. Let us note, however, that if a computation never
results in overﬂows or underﬂows when done with IEEE-754 double-precision
(resp. single-) arithmetic, it can be exactly simulated with the x87 in double-
precision (resp. single) mode.13

double precision computations in round-to-nearest mode, including with respect
to overﬂow and underﬂow conditions, one can use, at the same time, limitation
of precision and options and programming style that force operands to be sys-
tematically written to memory between ﬂoating-point operations. This incurs
some performance loss; furthermore, there will still be slight discrepancy due
to double rounding on underﬂow. A simpler solution for current personal com-
puters is simply to force the compiler to use the SSE unit for computations on
IEEE-754 types; however, most embedded systems using IA32 microprocessors
or microcontrollers do not use processors equipped with this unit.

Yet another solution is to do all computations in long double format. This
solves all inconsistency issues. However, long double formats are not the same
between processors and operating systems, thus this workaround leads to porta-
bility problems.

not semantically equivalent to performing separate addition, multiplication and
optional negate IEEE-compatible instructions; in fact, intermediate results are
computed with extra precision [Fre, 2001b, D.2]. Whether these instructions are
used or not depends on the compiler, optimisation options, and also how the
compiler subdivides instructions. For instance, gcc 3.3 compiles the following

without it if optimisation is oﬀ, yielding diﬀerent semantics:14

4 Mathematical functions

Many operations related to ﬂoating-point are not implemented in hardware;
most programs using ﬂoating-point will thus rely on suitable support libraries.
Our purpose, in this section, is not to comprehensively list bugs in current
ﬂoating-point libraries; it is to illustrate, using examples from common operating
systems and runtime environments, the kind of problems that may happen.

4.1 Transcendental functions

A ﬁrst remark is that, though IEEE-754 speciﬁes the behaviour of elementary
operations +,
, / and √, it does not specify the behaviour of other functions,
including the popular trigonometric functions. These are generally supplied by
a system library, occasionally by the hardware.

,

As an example, consider the sine function. On the x87, it is implemented in
hardware; on Linux IA32, the GNU libc function sin() is just a wrapper around
the hardware call, or, depending on compilation options, can be replaced by
inline assembly.15 Intel [Int, 2005,
6.5.5] claim
that their transcendental instructions (on recent processors) commit errors less
than 1 ulp in round-to-nearest mode; however it is to be understood that this is
after the operands of the trigonometric functions are reduced modulo 2π, which

Linux, and GNU libc on x86 64 (in 64-bit mode) yield -0x1.95b0115490ca6p-1.
A more striking example of discrepancies is sin(p) where p = 14885392687.
This value was chosen so that sin(p) is close to 0, in order to demonstrate
the impact of imprecise reduction modulo 2π.16 Both the Pentium 4 x87 and

ment the same transcendental functions with diﬀerent accuracies. We already
noted the diﬀerence between the AMD-K5 and the K6 and following processors
with respect to angular reduction.
Intel also notes that the algorithms’ pre-
cision was improved between the 80387 / i486DX processors and the Pentium
processors. [Int, 1997,

With the Intel486 processor and Intel 387 math coprocessor, the worst-
case, transcendental function error is typically 3 or 3.5 ulps, but is some-
times as large as 4.5 ulps.

15The latter behaviour is triggered by option -ffast-math. The documentation for this
function says it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an exact imple-
mentation of IEEE or ISO rules/speciﬁcations for math functions.

16Consider a rational approximation of π, i.e. integers p and q such that p/q

There thus may be ﬂoating-point discrepancies between the current Intel em-
bedded processors (based on i386 / i387) and the current Pentium workstation
processors.

To summarise, one should not expect consistent behaviour of transcendental
functions across libraries, processor manufacturers or models, although recent
developments such as the MPFR library17 provide exactly rounded transcen-
dental functions. In any case, static analysis tools should never assume that the
libraries on the analysis host platform behave identically to those on the target
platform, nor, unless it is speciﬁed in the documentation, that they fulﬁl prop-
erties such as monotonicity (on intervals where the corresponding mathematical
function is monotonic).

4.2 Non-default rounding modes

We also have found that ﬂoating-point libraries are often poorly tested in “un-
common” usage conditions, such as rounding modes diﬀerent from “round-to-
nearest”; or, perhaps, that they are not supposed to work in such modes, but
that this fact is not reﬂected adequately in documentation. This is especially
of interest for implementers of static analysers (Section 7.5), since some form of
interval arithmetic will almost certainly be used in such software.

FreeBSD 4.4 provides the fpsetround() function to set the rounding mode
of the processor. This function is the BSD counterpart of the C99 fesetround()
function. However, the printf() standard printing function of the C library
does not work properly if the processor is set in round-to-+
mode: when one
attempts to print very large values (such as 10308), one can get garbage output
(such as a colon in a location where a digit should be, e.g. :e+307).

∞

On GNU libc 2.2.93 on IA32 processors, the fesetround() function only
changed the rounding mode of the x87 FPU, while the gcc compiler also oﬀered
the possibility of compiling for SSE.

On GNU libc 2.3.3 on x86 64, computing xy using the pow() function in
round-to-+
mode can result in a segmentation violation for certain values
of x and y, e.g. x = 0x1.3d027p+6 and y = 0x1.555p-2. As for the exp()
exponential function, it gives a result close to 2502 on input 1, and a negative
result on input 0x1.75p+0. The problems were corrected in version 2.3.5.

4.3 Compiler issues

The C standard is fairly restrictive with respect to what compilers are allowed or
not allowed to do with ﬂoating-point operations. Unfortunately, some compilers
may fail to comply with the standard. This may create discrepancies between
what really happens on the one hand, and what users and static analysis tools
expect on the other hand.

17MPFR, available from http://www.mpfr.org, is a library built on top of the popular
GNU MP multiprecision library. MPFR provides arbitrary precision ﬂoating-point arithmetic
with the same four rounding modes as IEEE-754. In addition to the basic arithmetic opera-
tions speciﬁed by IEEE-754, MPFR also provides various arbitrary precision transcendental
functions with guaranteed rounding.

19

4.3.1 Standard pragmas

The C standard, by default, allows the compiler some substantial leeway in the
way that ﬂoating-point expressions may be evaluated. While outright simpli-
ﬁcations based on operator associativity are not permitted, since these can be
very unsound on ﬂoating-point types [ISO, 1999,
5.1.2.3 #13], the compiler is
for instance permitted to replace a complex expression by a simpler one, for
instance using compound operators (e.g. the fused multiply-and-add in Sec-
tion 3.2) [ISO, 1999, 6.5]:

§

A ﬂoating expression may be contracted, that is, evaluated as though it
were an atomic operation, thereby omitting rounding errors implied by the
source code and the expression evaluation method. [. . . ] This license is
speciﬁcally intended to allow implementations to exploit fast machine in-
structions that combine multiple C operators. As contractions potentially
undermine predictability, and can even decrease accuracy for containing
expressions, their use needs to be well-deﬁned and clearly documented.

While some desirable properties of contracted expressions [ISO, 1999,
requested, no precise behaviour is made compulsory.

§

F.6] are

Because of the inconveniences that discrepancies can create, the standard
also mandates a special directive, #PRAGMA STDC FP_CONTRACT [ISO, 1999,
7.12.2], for controlling whether or not such contractions can be performed.
§
Unfortunately, while many compilers will contract expressions if they can, few
compilers implement this pragma. As of 2007, gcc (v4.1.1) ignores the pragma
with a warning, and Microsoft’s Visual C++ handles it as a recent addition.

We have explained how, on certain processors such as the x87 (Section 3.1.1),
it was possible to change the precision of results by setting special ﬂags — while
no access to such ﬂags is mandated by the C norm, the possibility of various
precision modes is acknowledged by the norm [ISO, 1999, F.7.2]. Furthermore,
IEEE-754 mandates the availability of various rounding modes (Section 2.2);
in addition, some processors oﬀer further ﬂags that change the behaviour of
ﬂoating-point computations.

All changes of modes are done through library functions (or inline assembly)
executed at runtime; at the same time, the C compiler may do some computa-
tions at compile time, without regard to how these modes are set.

During translation the IEC 60559 default modes are in eﬀect: The
rounding direction mode is rounding to nearest. The rounding preci-
sion mode (if supported) is set so that results are not shortened. Trap-
ping or stopping (if supported) is disabled on all ﬂoating-point exceptions.
[. . . ] The implementation should produce a diagnostic message for each
translation-time ﬂoating-point exception, other than inexact; the imple-
mentation should then proceed with the translation of the program.

In addition, programs to be compiled may test or change the ﬂoating-point
status or operating modes using library functions, or even inline assembly. If
the compiler performs code reorganisations, then some results may end up being
computed before the applicable rounding modes are set. For this reason, the C
norm introduces #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON/OFF [ISO, 1999,

7.6.1]:

§

The FENV ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the implemen-
tation when a program might access the ﬂoating-point environment to test

20

ﬂoating-point status ﬂags or run under non-default ﬂoating-point control
modes.
[. . . ] If part of a program tests ﬂoating-point status ﬂags, sets
ﬂoating-point control modes, or runs under non-default mode settings,
but was translated with the state for the FENV ACCESS pragma oﬀ, the
behaviour is undeﬁned. The default state ( on or oﬀ ) for the pragma is
implementation-deﬁned. [. . . ] The purpose of the FENV ACCESS pragma
is to allow certain optimisations that could subvert ﬂag tests and mode
changes (e.g., global common subexpression elimination, code motion,
and constant folding). In general, if the state of FENV ACCESS is oﬀ, the
translator can assume that default modes are in eﬀect and the ﬂags are
not tested.

Another eﬀect of this pragma is to change how much the compiler can evalu-
ate at compile time regarding constant initialisations. [ISO, 1999, F.7.4, F.7.5].
If it is set to OFF, the compiler can evaluate ﬂoating-point constants at compile
time, whereas if they had been evaluated at runtime, they would have resulted
in diﬀerent values (because of diﬀerent rounding modes) or ﬂoating-point excep-
tion. If it is set to ON, the compiler may do so only for static constants — which
are generally all evaluated at compile time and stored as a block of constants in
the binary code of the program.

Unfortunately, as per the preceding pragma, most compilers do not recog-
nise this pragma. There may, though, be some compilation options that have
some of the same eﬀect. Again, the user should carefully read the compiler
documentation.

4.3.2 Optimisations and associativity

Some optimising compilers will apply rules such as associativity, which may
signiﬁcantly alter the outcome of an algorithm, and thus are not allowed to
apply according to the language standard. [ISO, 1999,

5.1.2.3]

A particularly interesting application of such permissiveness is vectorisation;
that is, using the features of certain processors (such as IA32, x86 64 or EM64T
processors, with a SSE unit) that enable doing the same mathematical operation
on several operands in a single instruction. Take for instance the following
program, which sums an array:

§

double s = 0.0;
for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {

s = s + t[i];

}

This code is not immediately vectorisable. However, assuming that n is a
multiple of two and that addition is associative, one may rewrite this code as
follows:

double sa[2], s; sa[0]=sa[1]= 0.0;
for(int i=0; i<n/2; i++) {

sa[0] = sa[0] + t[i*2+0];
sa[1] = sa[1] + t[i*2+1];

}
s = sa[0] + sa[1];

21

That is, we sum separately the elements of the array with even or odd indexes.
Depending on other conditions such as memory alignment, this code may be
immediately vectorised on processors that can do two simultaneous double pre-
cision operations with one single vector instruction.

If we compile the ﬁrst code fragment above using Intel’s icc compiler with
options -xW -O2 (optimise for Pentium 4 and compatible processors), we see
that the loop has been automatically vectorised into something resembling the
second fragment. This is because, by default, icc uses a “relaxed” confor-
mance mode with respect to ﬂoating-point; if one speciﬁes -fp-model precise,
then the application of associativity is prohibited and the compiler says “loop
was not vectorised: modifying order of reduction not allowed under given
switches”. Beta versions of gcc 4.2 do not vectorise this loop when using
-O3 -ftree-vectorize, but they will do so on appropriate platforms with op-
tion -ffast-math or the aptly named -funsafe-math-optimisations.

Another class of optimisations involves the assumption, by the compiler,

that certain values (

the distinction between

computations, but may be inappropriate in some contexts; for instance, some
computations on complex numbers use the fact that
0 are distinct [Kahan,
1987]. It is thus regrettable, besides being contrary the C standard, that some
compilers, such as icc, choose, by default, to assume that NaNs should not be

handled correctly, or that
a simple example.

Consider the problem of computing the minimum of two ﬂoating-point num-

bers. This can be implemented in four straightforward ways:

1. x < y ? x : y

2. x <= y ? x : y

3. x > y ? y : x

4. x >= y ? y : x

These four expressions are equivalent over the real numbers, but they are not if
one takes NaNs into account, or one diﬀerentiates

0. Witness:

On SSE (see

3.1.3), both icc, by default, and gcc with the -O2
-ffast-math option will compile all four expressions as though they were the
ﬁrst one. The reason is that the ﬁrst expression maps directly to one assembly
instruction, minss or minsd, while the others entail more complex and slower
code. Interestingly, if the four above expression are present in the same function,
gcc -O2 -ffast-math will detect that they are equivalent and simply reuse the
same result.

We echo William Kahan18 in deploring that some compilers allow them-
selves, by default, to ignore language standards and apply unsafe optimisations,

18See for instance the essay The baleful inﬂuence of SPEC benchmarks upon ﬂoating-point

arithmetic on Kahan’s web page.

22

presumably in order to increase performance in benchmarks. Some algorithms
are written in a certain way so as to minimise roundoﬀ error, and compilers
should not rewrite them in another way. Also, static analysis results obtained
from the source code (see Section 7.5) may not be applicable on the object code
if the compilers make such unsafe transformations. We thus suggest that users
of analysis tool operating on the source code read the documentation of their
compiler carefully in search of discussion of “relaxed” or “strict” ﬂoating-point
issues.

4.4 Input/output issues

Another possible compilation issue is how compilers interpret constants in source
code. The C norm states:

For decimal ﬂoating constants, and also for hexadecimal ﬂoating
constants when FLT RADIX19 is not a power of 2, the result is either
the nearest representable value, or the larger or smaller representable
value immediately adjacent to the nearest representable value, chosen in
an implementation-deﬁned manner. For hexadecimal ﬂoating constants
when FLT RADIX is a power of 2, the result is correctly rounded.

§

This means that two compilers on the same platform may well interpret the
same ﬂoating-point decimal literal in the source code as diﬀerent ﬂoating-point
value, even if both compilers follow C99 closely. Similar limitations apply to
the behaviour of the C library when converting from decimal representations to
ﬂoating-point variables [ISO, 1999,

7.20.1.3].
Reading and printing ﬂoating-point numbers accurately is a non-trivial issue
if the printing base (here, 10) is not a power of the computation base (binary
in the case of IEEE-754) [Clinger, 1990, Steele and White, 1990]. There exist
few guarantees as to the precision of results printed in decimal in the C norm
7.19.6.1, F.5]. IEEE-754, however, mandates some guarantees [IEC,
[ISO, 1999,
1989, IEE, 1985,
5.6], such that printing and reading back the values should
yield the same numbers, within certain bounds. However, we have seen that
the standard C libraries of certain systems are somewhat unreliable; thus, one
may prefer not to trust them on accuracy issues. Printing out exact values and
reading them is important for replaying exact test cases.

§

§

In order to alleviate this, we suggest the use of hexadecimal ﬂoating-point
constants, which are interpreted exactly. Unfortunately, many older compilers
do not support these; also, in order to print ﬂoating-point values as hexadecimal
easily, printf and associated functions have to support the %a and %A formats,
which is not yet the case of all current C libraries.

5 Example

Arguably, many of the examples we gave in the preceding sections, though cor-
rect, are somewhat contrived: they discuss small discrepancies, often happening
with very large or very small inputs. In this section, we give a complete and

realistic example of semantic problems related to diﬀerences between ﬂoating-
point implementations (even, dependent on compilation options!). It consists of
two parts:

1. an algorithm for computing a modulo (such as mapping an angle into
180, 180] degrees), inspired by an algorithm found in an embedded sys-

[
−
tem;

2. possible implementations of tabulated functions.

The composition of the two give seemingly innocuous implementations of angu-
lar periodic functions... which crash for certain speciﬁc values of the inputs on
certain platforms.

Given x, m and M (m < M ), we want to compute r such that r

x is an
integer multiple of M
M . The following algorithm, adapted

from code found in a real-life critical system, is correct if implemented over the
real numbers:

double modulo(double x, double mini, double maxi) {

double delta = maxi-mini;
double decl = x-mini;
double q = decl/delta;
return x - floor(q)*delta;

}

Let us apply this algorithm to the following case:

int main() {

double m = 180.;
double r = modulo(nextafter(m, 0.), -m, m);

}

We recall that floor(x ) is the greatest integer less than or equal to x , and
that nextafter(a, b ) is the next representable double value from a in the
direction of b . nextafter(m, 0.) is thus the greatest double-precision number
strictly smaller than 180.

360, then q is 1. The program then returns r
180.00000000000002842, which
is outside the speciﬁed bounds.

Simply rewriting the code as follows makes the problem disappear (because

the compiler holds the value in a register):

double modulo(double x, double mini, double maxi) {

double delta = maxi-mini;
return x - floor((x-mini)/delta)*delta;

}

This is especially troubling since this code and the previous one look semanti-
cally equivalent.

24

The same phenomenon occurs, even if optimisation is turned on, if we add a
logging statement (printf()) after the computation of decl. This is due to the
forced spilling of the ﬂoating-point registers into main memory across function
calls.

Interestingly enough, we discovered the above bug after Astr´ee would not
validate the ﬁrst code fragment with the post-condition that the output should
be between mini and maxi: Astr´ee was giving an interval with a lower bound
slightly below mini. After vainly trying to prove that the code fragment worked,
the author began to speciﬁcally search for counter-examples. In comparison,
simply performing unit testing on a IA32 PC will not discover the problem if the
compiler implements even simple register scheduling (which will be turned on by
any optimisation option). Guidelines for testing generally specify that programs
should be tested on the target system; however, unit testing on the target
architecture will discover this problem only if using carefully chosen values. The
above phenomenon was missed because testers, following testing guidelines, had
tested the program at points of discontinuity, and slightly before and after these
points, but had not tested the values just before and after these points.

Now, one could argue that the odds of landing exactly on nextafter(180.,
0.) are very rare. Assuming an embedded control routine executed at 100 kHz,
24 hours a day, and a uniform distribution of values in the [
180, 180] interval,
such a value should happen once every 4000 years or so on a single unit.20 How-
ever, in the case of a mass-produced system (an automobile model, for instance),
this argument does not hold. If hundreds of thousands of systems featuring a
defective component are manufactured every year, there will be real failures
happening when the systems are deployed — and they will be very diﬃcult to

odds are considerably higher with the same probabilistic assumptions: a single
100 Hz system would break down twice a day.

−

Now, it seems that a slight error such as this should be of no consequence:
the return value is less than the intended lower bound, but still extremely close
to it. However, let us consider a typical application of computing modulos:
computing some kind of periodic function, for instance depending on an angle.
Such a function is likely to contain trigonometric operators, or other operations
that are costly and complex to compute. A common way to work around this
cost and complexity is to look such functions up from a precomputed table.

One implementation technique sometimes found is to put all these tables in
some big array of constants (perhaps loaded from a ﬁle during initialisation),
and read from the array at various oﬀsets:

val = bigTable[r + 180 + FUNCTION_F_OFFSET];

This means an implicit truncation of r+180+FUNCTION_F_OFFSET to 0; if r is a

The table look-up can then yield whatever value is at this point in memory,
possibly totally out of the expected range.

Such kinds of problems are extremely diﬃcult to reproduce if they are found
in practise — they may result in program crashes or nondeterministic behaviour
for very rare input values. Furthermore, they are not likely to be elicited by
random testing.21 Finally, the problem may disappear if the program is tested
with another compiler, compilation options, or execution platform.

6 A few remarks on Java

§

Java’s early ﬂoating-point model was a strict subset of IEEE-754 [Gosling et al.,
1996,
4.2.3]: essentially, strict IEEE-754 single and double-precision arith-
metic without the exception traps (overﬂow, invalid operation. . . ) and without
rounding modes other than round-to-nearest. However, strict compatibility with
IEEE-754 single- and double-precision operations is diﬃcult to achieve on x87
(see Section 3.1.1). As a consequence, requests were made so that strict compat-
ibility would be relaxed in order to get better performance, particularly for sci-
entiﬁc computing applications. The possibility of giving up Java’s deterministic,
portable semantics was requested by some [Kahan and Darcy, 1998], but contro-
versial for others [Java Grande Forum Panel, 1998]. Finally, the Java language
4.2.3]: run-time computing in
speciﬁcation was altered [Gosling et al., 2000,
extra precision (single-extended and double-extended formats) was allowed for
classes and methods not carrying the new strictfp modiﬁer [Gosling et al.,
2000, 2005,
15.4]: they may be evaluated with an extended exponent range. To
summarise, the Java designers made it legal to compile expressions to straight-
forward x87 code.

§

§

This is actually a bolder decision than may appear at ﬁrst sight. The
whole design of the Java language, with well-deﬁned semantics, aimed at en-
forcing unique semantics for single-threaded programs22 that do not use system-
dependent features (ﬁles, graphical interfaces, etc.): a program that merely did

21The example described here actually demonstrates the importance of non-random testing:
that is, trying values that “look like they might cause problems”; that is, typically, values at
or close to discontinuities in the mathematical function implemented, special values, etc.

22Java does not attempt to prescribe how a multi-threaded program should be executed: it
describes valid multi-threading behaviours, all of which are equally acceptable [Gosling et al.,
2005, Chapter 17]. Some nondeterminism is thus acceptable.

26

single-threaded computations should behave identically regardless of the ma-
chine, operating system and Java runtime system. This decision breaks this
uniqueness of semantics and introduces platform dependencies, which Java was
supposed to overcome.

Let us take for instance the foo program of Section 3.1.1, translated into

Java:

class Foo {

static double foo(double v) {

double y = v*v;
return (y / v);

}

public static void main(String[] args) {

System.out.println(foo(1E308));

}

}

We use gcj (the Java compiler associated with gcc) version 4.1.1 on a x86 64
system. Unsurprisingly, when compiled to machine code for the SSE target, the
program prints Infinity. The results get more diverse on the x87 target:

•

•

•

If no optimisation is used, the program prints Infinity. Examination of
the assembly code shows that intermediate values are spilled to memory.

If optimisation level 1 is used (-O), then the program prints 1E308 (10308).
Intermediate values are left in registers, but functions are not inlined.

If optimisation level 3 is used (-O3), the program prints Infinity.
The compiler
the parameter to
System.out.println() is a constant. It computes that constant using
strict IEEE-754 double precision, thus the result.

function foo and detects

inlines

§

The strictfp modiﬁer should force the program to adopt strict IEEE-754
round-to-nearest semantics. However, this modiﬁer is ignored by gcj [Fre,
2.1] (and the above experiments show identical results regardless of
2005a,
strictfp). The author is even unsure that the behaviour noted above is cor-
rect even in the absence of strictfp: strictfp is supposed to aﬀect only
temporaries [Gosling et al., 2005,

15.4], and y is not a temporary.

§

The “normal” mode of operation of Java is not straight compilation to na-
tive code, but compilation to bytecode; the bytecode may then be executed
inside a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), comprising a Java Virtual Machine
(JVM). The simplest JVMs just interpret the bytecode, but more advanced
ones do “just-in-time compilation” (JIT). A JIT-capable virtual machine will
typically interpret bytecode at ﬁrst, but will detect frequently used functions
and will compile these to native codes. Because JIT occurs at runtime, it can
perform advanced optimisations, such as detecting that certain arguments occur
frequently for certain functions and specialising these functions, that is, compil-
ing a special version of these functions for certain values of its arguments and
replacing the calls to the generic function by calls to the specialised function
when appropriate. The same kind of problems that we gave above for generation
of native code can thus occur: the interpreted version will spill temporaries to

27

memory and output one value, a JIT-compiled version may give another value,
but if JIT specialises the function it may give a third value (or the same value as
if interpreted). Note that JIT can thus dynamically change the semantics of a
function for reasons unrelated to the program being executed: the programmer
has no means to predict or control when and how JIT compilation is performed.
We can conclude that programmers should be cautious before assuming that
Java programs will behave predictably when using ﬂoating-point. First, this is
only true if the strictfp modiﬁer is used, and, even then, some very popular
compilers and runtime systems (gcj ships by default with many GNU/Linux
systems) ignore this modiﬁer and may even ignore some other parts of the
speciﬁcation. The presence of JIT compilers may also add various amusing
eﬀects.

Implications for program veriﬁcation

Program veriﬁcation comprises a variety of methods whose goals is to prove
formally that programs ﬁt their speciﬁcations, often lumped together under
the term “formal methods”. Formal methods have long ignored ﬂoating-point
computations, because they were judged too baroque or too diﬃcult to model.

7.1 Goals of program veriﬁcations

Purposes of veriﬁcation of programs using ﬂoating-point computations may be,
in increasing order of complexity:

1. Proving that the program will never trigger “undeﬁned” or “undesirable”
behaviours, such as an overﬂow on a conversion from a ﬂoating-point type
to an integer type. This problem has attracted the attention of both the
industrial world and the program analysis community since the much pub-
licised self-destruction of the Ariane 5 launcher during its maiden ﬂight,
which was due to overﬂow in a conversion from a 64-bit ﬂoating point
value to a 16-bit integer [Lions et al., 1996].

Proving that a value does not overﬂow entails ﬁnding some bounds for
that value, and if that value is the result of a complex computation de-
pending on the history of previous inputs and outputs (as is the case of e.g.
inﬁnite impulse response ﬁlters, rate limiters, and combinations thereof),
then ﬁnding and proving such bounds entails proving the stability of the
numerical computation. In many cases, though, automatic program anal-
ysers, taking as input the source code of the program (typically in C or
some other language, perhaps even in assembly language) can automati-
cally compute properties of such systems. If the analyser is sound, then
all the properties it prints (say, x < 5) hold for every run of the analysed
programs.
The Astr´ee system analyses programs written in a subset of the C pro-
gramming language [Cousot et al., 2005, Blanchet et al., 2003, 2002] and
attempts bounding all variables and proving the absence of overﬂows and
other runtime errors. While it is possible to specify assertions (such as
bounds on some variables representing physical quantities with known lim-

28

its), which Astr´ee will attempt to prove, the system is not designed to
prove such user-deﬁned properties.

2. Pin-pointing the sources of roundoﬀ errors in the program; proving an

upper bound on the amount of roundoﬀ error in some variable.

While in the preceding class of problems, it does not matter whether the
numerical computation makes sense as long as it does not crash or vi-
olate some user-speciﬁed assertion, here the problems are subtler. The
Fluctuat tool automatically provides results on the origin and magni-
tude of roundoﬀ errors in numerical programs [Martel, 2006, Goubault,
2001, Martel, 2002b,a].

3. Proving that the program implements such or such numerical computation
up to some speciﬁed error bound. Except in the simplest cases, automated
methods are unsuitable; if formal proofs are desired, then computerised
proof assistants may help. Proving that a program ﬁts its speciﬁcation
is diﬃcult in general, even more so over numerical programs, which do
not have “good” algebraic properties; yet some progress has been recently
made in that direction [Filliˆatre and Boldo, 2007].

7.2 Semantic bases of program analysis

In order to provide some proofs in the mathematical sense, one has to start with
a mathematical deﬁnition of program behaviours, that is, a semantics. [Winskel,
1993] This semantics should model all possible concrete behaviours of the sys-
tem, without omitting any.

An alternative point of view is that, for the sake of simplicity of veriﬁca-
tion, the chosen semantics may fail to reﬂect some behaviours of the concrete
system. For instance, one may consider that all ﬂoating-point variables behave
as real numbers. We have shown, however, in Sec. 5, that very real bugs can
occur in simple, straightforward programs that are correct if implemented over
the real numbers, but that exhibit odd, even fatal, behaviours due to ﬂoating-
point roundoﬀ. Such an approach is thus risky if the goal is to provide some
assurance that the program performs correctly, but it may be suitable for bug-
ﬁnding systems, whose goal is not to prove the absence of bugs, but to direct
programmers to probable bugs. Indeed, bug-ﬁndings techniques are typically
unsound : they trade soundness (all possible bugs should be listed) for ease of
use (not too many warnings about bugs that do not exist) and eﬃciency (quick
analysis). In that context, methods that consider that ﬂoating-point variables
contain real numbers (as opposed to ﬂoating-point values), or that integer vari-
ables contain unbounded integers (as opposed to n-bit integers computed using
modular arithmetic), may be relevant.

In this paper, we are concerned with sound veriﬁcation techniques: tech-
niques that only produce correct results; that is, if the analysis of a program
results in the analyser claiming that some conversion from ﬂoating-point to in-
teger will not overﬂow, then it should not be possible to have this conversion
overﬂow, regardless of inputs and roundoﬀ errors. Given the various misunder-
standings about ﬂoating-point that we cited in the previous sections, it is no
surprise that it is extremely easy for an analysis designer to build an unsound

29

static analysis tool without meaning it, for instance by starting with a semantics
of ﬂoating-point operations that does not model reality accurately enough.

It is well-known that any method for program veriﬁcation cannot be at the
same time sound (all results produced are truthful), automatic (no human inter-
vention), complete (true results can always be proved) and terminating (always
[Cousot, 1990],23 unless one supposes that program mem-
produces a result)
ory is ﬁnite and thus that the system is available to model-checking techniques.
Given that the state spaces of programs with ﬂoating-point variables are enor-
mous even with small numbers of variables, and that the Boolean functions
implementing ﬂoating-point computations are not very regular, it seems that
model-checking for whole ﬂoating-point algorithms should not be tractable. As
a consequence, we must content ourselves with techniques that are unsound,
non-terminating, incomplete, or not automatic, or several at the same time.
The purpose of this section is to point out how to avoid introducing unsound-
ness through carelessness.

All terminating automatic program analysis methods are bound to be incom-
plete; that is, they may be unable to prove certain true facts. Incompleteness
is equivalent to considering a system that has more behaviours than the true
concrete system. Since we must be incomplete anyway, it is as well that we
take this opportunity to simplify the system to make analysis more tractable;
in doing so, we can still be sound as long as we only add behaviours, and not
remove any. For instance, in Astr´ee, most analyses do not attempt to track
exactly (bit-by-bit) the possible relationships between ﬂoating-point values, but
rather rely on the bound on roundoﬀ given by inequality 3.

7.3 Diﬃculties in deﬁning sound semantics

We have seen many problems regarding the deﬁnition of sound semantics for
programs using ﬂoating-point; that is, how to attach to each program a math-
ematical characterisation of what it actually does. The following approaches
may be used:

•

•

A naive approach to the concrete semantics of programs running on
“IEEE-754-compatible” platforms is to consider that a +, -, * or / sign in
the source code, between operands of type float (resp. double), corre-
operation, with single-precision
sponds to a strict IEEE-754
(resp. double-precision) operands and result: a
b = r(a + b) where r
rounds to the target precision. As we have seen, this does not hold in
many common cases, especially on the x87 (Section 3.1.1).

A second approach is to analyse assembly or object code, and take the
exact processor-speciﬁed semantics as the concrete semantics for each
operation. This is likely to be the best solution if the compiler is not
trusted not to make “unsafe optimisations” (see
It is possible
to perform static analysis directly on the assembly code, or even object
code [Balakrishnan and Reps, 2004]. In addition, it is possible, if source

4.3.2).

§

23The formal version of this result is a classic of recursion theory, known as Rice’s theorem:
let C be a collection of partial recursive functions of one variable, then, noting φx the partial
recursive function numbered x, then
has a recursive characteristic function if
∈
and only if C is empty or contains all partial recursive functions of all variables. [Rogers, 1987,
p. 34][Rice, 1953, corollary B] This result is proved by reduction to the halting problem.

code in a high level language is available, to help the assembly-level static
analyser with information obtained from source-level analysis, through in-
variant translation [Rival, 2003], which may be helpful for instance for
pointer information.

One remaining diﬃculty is that some “advanced” functions in ﬂoating-
point units may have been deﬁned diﬀerently in successive generations
of processors, so we still cannot rule out discrepancies. However, when
doing analysis for embedded systems, the exact kind of target processor
is generally known, so it is possible to use information as to its behaviour.
Another possibility is to request that programmers do not use poorly-
speciﬁed functions of the processor.

•

A third approach is to encompass all possible semantics of the source code
into the analysis. Static analysis methods based on abstract interpreta-
tions (Section 7.5) are well-suited for absorbing such “implementation-
deﬁned” behaviours while still staying sound.

7.4 Hoare logic

As an example in the diﬃculty of proposing simple semantics based on the
source code of the program, let us consider the proof rules of the popular Hoare
logic [Hoare, 1969, Winskel, 1993]. These rules are the basis of many proof
assistants and other systems for proving properties on imperative programs. A
Hoare triple
is read as follows: if the program state at the beginning
of the execution of program c veriﬁes property A, then, if c terminates, then the
ﬁnal program state veriﬁes property B. A rule

if we can prove the hypotheses H1, . . . , Hn, then we can prove the
reads as:
conclusion C by applying rule r. If there are zero hypotheses, then we say rule
r is an axiom.

We recall the classical rules for assignment, sequence of operation, and test:

In the following rule, we use hypotheses of the form

used to reason about programs, is parametrised by an underlying mathematical
logic, used to reason about the quantities inside the program.

⊕

Hoare logic is generally used inside a proof assistant, a program which al-
lows the user to prove properties following the rules, possibly with some partial
automation. The proof assistant must know how to reason about ﬂoating-point
quantities. x
y may be deﬁned as r(x + y), where r is the appropriate round-
ing function. x + y is the usual operation over the reals (thus, the underlying
mathematical logic of the Hoare prover should include a theory of the reals),
and r is the rounding function, which may be deﬁned axiomatically. Inequalities
such as ineq. 2, or properties such as r
r = r then appear as lemmas of the
mathematical prover. An axiomatisation of the ﬂoating-point numbers is, for
instance, used in the Caduceus tool [Filliˆatre and Boldo, 2007].

◦

However, the above rules, as well as all tools based on them, including
Caduceus, are unsound when applied to programs running on architectures
such as the x87. They assume that any given arithmetic or Boolean expres-
sion has a unique value, depending only the value of all variables involved,
and that this value does not change unless at least one of the variables in-
volved changes through an assignment (direct or through pointers). Yet, in the
program zero_nonzero.c of Sec. 3.1.1, we have shown that it is possible that
inequality z != 0 holds at a program line, then, without any instruction assign-
ing anything to z in whatever way, that inequality ceases to hold. Any proof
assistant straightforwardly based on Hoare logic would have accepted proving
that the assertion in zero_nonzero.c always holds, whereas it does not in some
concrete executions.

Such tools based on “straightforward” Hoare rules are thus sound only on
architectures and compilation schemes for which the points where rounding
takes place are precisely known. This excludes:

•

•

The x87 architecture, because of rounding points depending on register
scheduling and other circumstances not apparent in the source code.

Architectures using a fused multiply-add instruction, such as the PowerPC
(Sec. 3.2), because one does not know whether x
z will get executed
as r(r(x

y) + z) or r(xy + z).

What can we propose to make these tools sound even on such architectures?
The ﬁrst possibility is to have tools operate not on the C source code (or, more
generally, any high-level source code) but on the generated assembly code, whose
semantics is unambiguous.24 However, directly checking assembly code is stren-
uous, since code in assembly language is longer than in higher-level languages,
directly deals with many issues hidden in higher-level languages (such as stack
allocation of variables), and exhibits many system dependencies.

Another solution for the x87 rounding issue, is to replace the “simple” ax-
iomatic semantics given above by a nondeterministic semantics where the non-
determinacy of the position of rounding is made explicit.
Instead of an as-
signment x := a being treated as a single step, it is broken into a sequence of
elementary operations. Thus, x := a
c), over the double precision num-
t. Then, each operation is written
bers, is decomposed into t := b

The transformation consists in using the re rounding operation in elemen-
b gets translated as re(a + b)) and prepending an
tary operations (thus a
optional (nondeterministically chosen) rd rounding step before any operation
on any operand on that operation. The resulting code is then suitable for
proofs in Hoare logic, and the properties proved are necessarily fulﬁlled by any
compilation of the source code, because, through nondeterminism, we have en-
compassed all possible ways of compiling the operations. We have thus made
the proof method sound again, at the expense of introduced nondeterminism
(which, in practise, will entail increased complexity and tediousness when prov-
ing properties) and also, possibly, of increased incompleteness with respect to a
particular target (we consider behaviours that cannot occur on that target, due
to the way the compiler allocates registers or schedules instructions).

If we know more about the compiler or the application binary interface, we
can provide more precise semantics (less nondeterminism, encompassing fewer
cases that cannot occur in practice). For instance, using the standard parameter
passing scheme on IA32 Linux for a non-inline function, ﬂoating-point values
are passed on the stack. Thus, a Hoare logic semantics for parameter passing
would include a necessary rs (single precision) or rd rounding phase, which could
simplify the reasoning down the program, for instance by using the fact that
rs

rs = rs and rd

A similar technique may be used to properly handle compound instructions
such as fused-multiply-add. On a processor where fused-multiply-add yields

This technique, however, relies on the knowledge of how the compiler may
possibly group expressions. Because compilers can optimise code across instruc-
tions and even across function calls, it is likely that the set of possible ways of
compiling a certain code on a certain platform is large.

To summarise our ﬁndings: the use of Hoare-logic provers is hampered by
platforms or language where a given ﬂoating-point expression does not have a
single, unambiguous meaning; straightforward application of the rules may yield
unsound results, and workarounds are possible, but costly.

7.5 Static analysers based on abstract interpretation

We here consider methods based on abstract interpretation, a generic frame-
work for giving an over-approximation of the set of possible program execu-
tions. [Cousot and Cousot, 1992] An abstract domain is a set of possible sym-
bolic constraints with which to analyse programs. For instance, the interval
C2, the octagon abstract
domain represents constraints of the form C1 ≤

7.5.1 Intervals

The most basic domain for the analysis of ﬂoating-point programs is the in-
terval domain [Blanchet et al., 2002, Min´e, 2004a,b]:
to each quantity x in
the program, attach an interval [mx, Mx] such that in any concrete execution,
[mx, Mx]. Such intervals [mx, Mx] can be computed eﬃciently in a static
x
analyser for software running on a IEEE-754 machine if one runs the analyser
on a IEEE-754 machine, by doing interval arithmetic on the same data types as
used in the concrete system, or smaller ones.

Fixing x, y

[a′, b′] by [a

y is monotonic. It is therefore tempting, when imple-
b′] with
menting interval arithmetic, to approximate [a, b]
the same rounding mode. Unfortunately, this is not advisable unless one is
really sure that computations in the program to be analysed are really done
with the intended precision (no extended precision temporary values, as com-
mon on x87, see Sec. 3.1.1), do not suﬀer from double rounding eﬀects (see 3.1.2
and the preceding section), and do not use compound operations instead of
atomic elementary arithmetic operations. In contrast, it is safe to use directed
rounding: computing upper bounds in round-to-+
mode, and lower bounds
⊕+∞ b′].25 This is what
in round-to-
is done in Astr´ee [Cousot et al., 2005]. Note, however, that on some systems,
rounding-modes other than round-to-nearest are poorly tested and may fail to
work properly (see Section 4.2); the implementers of analysers should therefore
pay extra caution in that respect.

Another area where one should exercise caution is strict comparisons. A sim-
ple solution for abstracting the outcome for x of x < y, where x

x = min(Mx, My), as if one abstracted x <= y. Un-
y
fortunately, this is not suﬃcient to deal with programs that use special ﬂoating-
point values as markers (say, 0 is a special value meaning “end of table”). One
can thus take M ′
x = min(Mx, pred(My)) where pred(x) is the largest ﬂoating-
point number less than x in the exact ﬂoating-point type used. However, as we
showed in
3.1.1, on x87 a comparison may be performed on extended precision
operands, which may later be rounded to lesser precisions depending on register
spills. We showed in the preceding section that this particularity made some
proof methods unsound, and it also makes the above bound unsound.

∈

§

In order to be sound, we should use the pred operation on the extended preci-
sion type; but then, because of possible rounding to lesser precisions, we should
round the bounds of the interval... which would bring us back to abstracting <
as we abstract

.

We can, however, reﬁne the technique even more.

If we know that x is
exactly representable in single (resp. double) precision, then we can safely use
the pred function on single (resp. double) precision ﬂoats. Some knowledge of
the compiler and the application binary interface may help an analyser establish
that a variable is exactly representable in a ﬂoating-point type; for instance, if
a function is not inlined and receives a ﬂoating-point value in a double variable

passed by value on the stack, then this value is exactly representable in double
precision. More generally, values read from memory without the possibility that
the compiler has “cached” them inside a register will necessarily be representable
in the ﬂoating-point format associated with the type of the variable.

7.5.2 Numerical relational domains

The interval domain, while simple to implement, suﬀers from not keeping rela-
tions between variables. For many applications, one should also use relational
abstract domains — abstract domains capable of reﬂecting relations between
two or more variables. Relational domains however tend to be designed for data
taken in ideal structures (ordered rings, etc.); it is thus necessary to bridge the
gap between these ideal abstract structures and the concrete execution. Fur-
thermore, it is necessary to have eﬀective, implementable algorithms for the
abstract domains.

Min´e proposed three abstraction steps [Min´e, 2004a,b]:

1. From a (deterministic) semantics over ﬂoating-point numbers to a non-
deterministic semantics over the real numbers, taking into account the
rounding errors.

2. From the “concrete” nondeterministic semantics over the reals, to some
ideal abstract domain over the reals (R) or the rationals (Q), such as the
octagon abstract domain [Min´e, 2001].

3. Optionally, the ideal abstract domain is over-approximated by some eﬀec-
tive implementation. For instance, wherever a real number is computed
in the ideal domain, a lower or upper bound, or both, is computed in the
implementation, for instance using ﬂoating-point arithmetic with directed
rounding.

Following a general method in abstract interpretation [Cousot, 1997], the

succession of abstraction steps yields a hierarchy of semantics:

concrete semantics over the ﬂoats

⊑
nondeterministic semantics over the reals

⊑
ideal abstract domain over R or Q

⊑
(optional) eﬀective implementation over the ﬂoats

The analysis method is sound (no program behaviour is ignored), but, because
of the abstractions, is incomplete (the analyser takes into account program
behaviours that cannot appear in reality, thus is incapable of proving certain
tight properties).

The ﬁrst step is what this paper is concerned about: a sound modelling of
the ﬂoating-point computations. If this step is not done is a sound manner, for
instance if the semantics of the programming language or the target platform
with respect to ﬂoating point are misunderstood, then the whole analysis may
be unsound.

The simplest solution, as proposed by Min´e and implemented in Astr´ee,
is to consider that the “real” execution and the ﬂoating-point execution diﬀer

by a small error, which can be bound as recalled in 2.2 (

εabs). However, in doing so, one must be careful not to be too optimistic:
for instance, because of possible double rounding, the error bounds suitable
for simply rounded round-to-nearest computations may be incorrect if, due to
possible “spills”, double rounding may occur (see 3.1.2). The εrel coeﬃcient
must thus be adjusted to compensate possible double rounding.

The second step depends on the abstract domain. For instance, for the
octagon abstract domain [Min´e, 2001], it consists in a modiﬁed shortest-path
algorithm. In any case, it should verify the soundness property: if a constraint
(such as x + y < 3) is computed, then this constraint should be true on any
concrete state. Finally, the last step is usually achieved using directed rounding.

7.5.3 Symbolic abstract domains

⊕

Other kinds of relational domains propagate pure constraints or guards (say,
x = y
z). An example is Min´e’s symbolic rewrite domain implemented in
Astr´ee [Min´e, 2004a]. Intuitively, if some arithmetic condition is true on some
variables x and y, and neither x nor y are suppressed, then the condition con-
tinues to hold later. However, we have seen in Section 3.1 that one should
beware of “hidden” rounding operations, which may render certain propagated
identities invalid. We may work around this issue using the same techniques as
in Sec. 7.4: allow rounding at intermediate program points.

In addition, we have also seen that certain equivalences such as x

y =
x = y are not necessarily valid, depending on whether certain modes

such as ﬂush-to-zero are active.26

7.6 Testing

In the case of embedded system development, the development platform (typi-
cally, a PC running some variant of IA32 or x86 64 processors) is not the same as
the target platform (typically, a microcontroller). Often, the target platform is
much slower, thus making extensive unit testing time-consuming; or there may
be a limited number of them for the development group. As a consequence, it
is tempting to test or debug numerical programs on the development platform.
We have shown that this can be a risky approach, even if both the development
platform and the target platform are “IEEE-754 compatible”, because the same
program can behave diﬀerently on two IEEE-754 compatible platforms.

We have also seen that in some cases, even if the testing and the target
platform are identical, the ﬁnal result may depend on the vagaries of compila-
tion. One should be particularly cautious on platforms, such as IA32 processors
with the x87 ﬂoating-point unit, where the results of computations can depend
on register scheduling. Even inserting “monitoring” instructions can aﬀect the
ﬁnal result, because these can change register allocation, which can change the
results of computations on the x87. This is especially an issue since it is common
to have “debugging-only” statements excluded from the ﬁnal version loaded in
the system. In the case of the x87, it is possible to limit the discrepancies (but
not totally eradicate them) by setting the ﬂoating-point unit to 53-bit mantissa
precision, if one computes solely with IEEE-754 double precision numbers.

Static analysis techniques where concrete traces are replayed inside the anal-
ysis face similar problems. One has to have an exact semantic model of the
program to be analysed as it runs on the target platform.

8 Conclusion

Despite claims of conformance to standards, common software/hardware plat-
forms may exhibit subtle diﬀerences with respect to ﬂoating-point computations.
These diﬀerences pose special problems for unit testing or debugging, unless one
uses exactly the same object code as the one executed in the target environment.
More subtly, on some platforms, the exact same expression, with the same
values in the same variables, and the same compiler, can be evaluated to diﬀer-
ent results, depending on seemingly irrelevant statements (printing debugging
information or other constructs that do not openly change the values of vari-
ables). This is in particular the case on the Intel 32-bit platform, due to the
way that temporary variables are commonly handled by compilers. This breaks
an assumption, common in program veriﬁcation techniques, that, barring the
modiﬁcation of some of the variables used in the expression (directly or through
a pointer), the same expression or test evaluates twice to the same value. We
have seen that this assumption is false, even providing concrete example where a
condition holds, then ceases to hold two program lines later, with no instruction
in the source code that should change this condition in between.

We proposed some alterations to program veriﬁcation techniques based on
Hoare logic in order to cope with systems where this assumption does not hold.
However, these alterations, necessary in order to preclude proving false state-
ments on programs, make proofs more complex due to increase nondeterminism.
With respect to automated analysis techniques based on abstract interpretation,
we explained how to cope with the Intel 32-bit platform in a sound way, includ-
ing with precise analysis of strict comparisons, through simple techniques.

With respect to the development of future systems, both hardware, and
software, including compilers, we wish to stress that reproducibility of ﬂoating-
point computations is of paramount importance for safety-critical applications.
All designs — such as the common compilation schemes on the Intel 32-bit
platform — where the results can change depending on seemingly irrelevant
circumstances such as the insertion of a “print” statement make debugging fringe
conditions in ﬂoating-point programs diﬃcult, because the insertion of logging
instructions may perturb results. They also make several program analysis
techniques unsound, leading to sometimes expensive ﬁxes.

The fact that some well-known compilers, by default, decide to activate
optimisations that contradict published programming language standards and
also break veriﬁcation techniques, is not comforting. “Unsafe” optimisations
often yield improved performance, but their choice should be conscious.

# PHP Hangs On Numeric Value 2.2250738585072011e-308

By [Rick Regan](https://www.exploringbinary.com/about/) January 3rd, 2011

I stumbled upon a very strange bug in PHP; this statement sends it into an infinite loop:

```

<?php $d = 2.2250738585072011e-308; ?>

```

(The same thing happens if you write the number without scientific notation — 324 decimal places.)

I hit this bug in the two places I tested for it: on Windows (PHP 5.3.1 under XAMPP 1.7.3), and on Linux (PHP Version 5.3.2-1ubuntu4.5) — both on an Intel Core Duo processor. I’ve written a [bug report](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53632 "See PHP bug report “PHP hangs on numeric value 2.2250738585072011e-308”").

## What’s Going On?

As a string, 2.2250738585072011e-308 causes no problems; it’s when it’s treated as a numeric value that the bug hits.

This works:

```

<?php $d = '2.2250738585072011e-308'; echo $d; ?>

```

but this doesn’t:

```

<?php $d = '2.2250738585072011e-308'; echo $d + 0; ?>

```

I don’t have a debug build of PHP available, but I did poke around in the source code (version 5.2.8). I found zend\_strtod.c, which appears to be based on a very old version of [David Gay’s strtod() function](https://www.ampl.com/netlib/fp/dtoa.c "David Gay's dtoa.c"). I don’t know if zend\_strtod() is even called in this case, but it was simple enough for me to isolate it and run it outside of PHP — under Visual C++ in fact. It did not hang on that input. (Update: zend\_strtod() *is* called, and I *can* hang zend\_strtod() in Visual C++ if I compile with all optimizations.)

### What’s Special About 2.2250738585072011e-308?

2.2250738585072011e-308 represents the largest [subnormal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number "Wikipedia article on denormal numbers") double-precision floating-point number; written as a [hexadecimal floating-point constant](https://www.exploringbinary.com/hexadecimal-floating-point-constants/ "Read Rick Regan's article “Hexadecimal Floating-Point Constants”"), it’s 0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022. 2.2250738585072011e-308 is one of five 17-digit decimal values that convert (correctly) to 0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022:

* 2.2250738585072007e-308
* 2.2250738585072008e-308
* 2.2250738585072009e-308
* 2.2250738585072010e-308
* 2.2250738585072011e-308

Only 2.2250738585072011e-308 causes the problem. It happens to be the largest of the five decimal values, so I guess that matters somehow.

If you have any thoughts on what the bug is, please let me (or [PHP](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53632 "See PHP bug report “PHP hangs on numeric value 2.2250738585072011e-308”")) know.

## Is This Serious?

I’ve gotten no response to my bug report yet, but I can’t help but wonder: is this serious? Could you bring down a Web server by entering this constant in a PHP-based form?

## Update

Yes, it’s serious.

1/4/2011: There is a lot of discussion about this, in addition to the comments below; for example, see

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/evtrq/php_hangs_on_numeric_value_22250738585072011e308/ "reddit").
* [Slashdot](https://it.slashdot.org/story/11/01/06/1820208/PHP-Floating-Point-Bug-Crashes-Servers "slashdot").
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2066352 "Hacker News").
* My [PHP bug report](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53632 "PHP bug report “PHP hangs on numeric value 2.2250738585072011e-308”").

And as pointed out in the comments, equivalent forms of the number also cause the problem:

* Variations on the placement of the decimal point: 0.22250738585072011e-307, 22.250738585072011e-309, 22250738585072011e-324, etc.
* Leading zeros: e.g., **0**2.2250738585072011e-308.
* Trailing zeros: e.g., 2.2250738585072011**0**e-308.
* Leading zeros in the exponent: e.g., 2.2250738585072011e-**0**308.
* (Combinations of the above)

You can also alter the full 324 decimal place version of the number with leading and trailing zeros.

1/22/2011: I thought of another set of numbers that cause the same problem — numbers of 18 digits or more but with the same 17 digit prefix. For example:

* 2.22507385850720111e-308
* 2.225073858507201123e-308
* 2.22507385850720113099e-308
* 2.225073858507201100001e-308
* 2.2250738585072011123456789012345678901234567890123456789e-308
* etc.

In decimal these numbers are distinct, but they all map to the same floating-point number.

It seems the only ones that cause a problem though are those whose 18th digit is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (2.22507385850720114e-308 doesn’t cause the problem, for example).

## Update: The Bug Has Been Fixed

The bug fix was released on 1/6/2011; this is from the [PHP news release](https://www.php.net/archive/2011.php#id2011-01-06-1 "See PHP 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug Fix News Release"):

> This release resolves a critical issue … where conversions from string to double might cause the PHP interpreter to hang on systems using x87 FPU registers.

> The problem is known to only affect x86 32-bit PHP processes, regardless of whether the system hosting PHP is 32-bit or 64-bit.

## Update: An Analysis of the Bug and Its Fix

I’ve found the specific cause of the bug, and why the fix fixes it; please see my article “[Why “Volatile” Fixes the 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug](https://www.exploringbinary.com/why-volatile-fixes-the-2-2250738585072011e-308-bug/ "Read Rick Regan's Article “Why “Volatile” Fixes the 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug”").”

## Update: The Real Problem Is the Old Copy of dtoa.c

This bug could have been avoided altogether if zend\_strtod() was kept in sync with David Gay’s strtod(); see my article “[A Better Fix for the PHP 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug](https://www.exploringbinary.com/a-better-fix-for-the-php-2-2250738585072011e-308-bug/ "Read Rick Regan's Article “A Better Fix for the PHP 2.2250738585072011e-308 Bug”").”

   Bug appearing at my Core 2 Duo / Win7 / PHP 5.3.0.

   This is \*really\* serious. In fact, I’ve just tested if the problem happens for GET passed values and it does. Not all the passed data to a website is treated as a number, so not all websites with the PHP versions and configuration that could fail with this bug will be vulnerable, but definitely there is going to be a huge amount of websites that will do. This is really scaring.

   I hope the PHP team patch it soon.

   Meanwhile, a possible workaround would be adding this line at the very top of the execution of php website:

   if (strpos(str\_replace(‘.’, ”, serialize($GLOBALS)), ‘22250738585072011’)!==false) die();

   This will stop execution if any decimal version of the number were passed as parameter. Note that 222.50738585072011e-310 cause problems too, and any of the other possibilities to write it.

   Do you know if there are any other possible ways to write the number that causes trouble too?

    Many people are reporting different PHP versions and saying whether the problem manifests there or not.

    The relevant variable is actually the CPU architecture.

    On 32-bit systems (i386), it freezes (PHP 5.2.x and 5.3.x). On 64-bit systems (i686, amd64), it does not.

    Confirmed to affect i386 (32-bit) FreeBSD 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x with any PHP 5.x.x version, built from ports. CGI vs. CLI doesn’t matter.

    Issue does not affect 64-bit FreeBSD (6.x, 7.x, or 8.x) using PHP 5.x.x.

    You can attempt to reproduce the issue via CLI by doing:

    php -r ‘$d = 2.2250738585072011e-308;’

    I should note that the infinite loop does result in PHP wedging to the point of it taking 100% CPU time. I did not have the time nor desire to run it under gdb and debug this utter nonsense.

    PHP 5.3.4 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Dec 16 2010 21:08:08)

    This doesn’t effect PHP 4, at least not the build I am running, it’s a bit old on this machine.

    For those on 64-bit machines, won’t the equivalent (much larger) 64 bit value likely result in the same bug?

    @RoundSparrow: This is a 64-bit double. I don’t believe 64-bit architectures have 128-bit doubles, if they do then the value you may wish to try will be around 1.189731495357231765085759326628007 e-4932.

    > Follow-up: PROBLEM SOLVED.

    > This problem occurs due to IA-32’s 80-bit floating point arithmetic. The simple fix: add a “-ffloat-store” flag to your CFLAGS.

    > The problematic function, zend\_strtod, seems to parse the mantissa (2.225…011 part) and the exponent (-308 part) separately, calculate the approximation of m\*10^e and successively improve that approximation until the error becomes less than 0.5ulp. The problem is that this particular number causes the infinite loop (i.e. the iteration does not improve the error at all) in 80-bit FP, but does not in 64-bit FP. Since x86-64 in general uses the SSE2 instruction set (with 64-bit FP) instead of the deprecated x87 it does not have this problem.

    I got:

    PHP 5.3.3-6 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Dec 7 2010 18:23:49)

    Copyright (c) 1997-2009 The PHP Group

    with Suhosin v0.9.32.1, Copyright (c) 2007-2010, by SektionEins GmbH

    On a debian 64 bit install with latest updates etc.

    And it does hang my system!

    The funny thing is, i ALSO get the bug when using string (GET/POST) functions.

    It doesn’t really affect the whole domain though, apache kills php after a timeout and restarts it, the website stays available to others browsing at that moment. It just jumps to 100% CPU usage on 1 core for a sec.

    Still, badass weird bug, I wonder if they’re accidentally using a 1 to MAX\_INTEGER+1 value system instead of 0 to MAX\_INTEGER, causing it to overflow somehow ..

    Only wild guesses here.

    Still, nice finding!

    @Pierre,

    Yes, technically, “can you take a look at it please?” is a response; but maybe a real response would have been “we can confirm this happens” or “this could be serious” or “this is a security issue”. I have minimal knowledge of PHP — I don’t see how I could have made that determination myself.

     Consider that we do that already, if it was not reproduceable or not a real bug (bogus), it would have been closed in the 1st place.

     We have slapped together a quick workaround.

     Have to use substring-search because “2.2250738585072011e-308” could also be spelled “02.2250738585072011e-308” or “002.2250738585072011e-308” etc.

     @Rafi,

     What about variations on the placement of the decimal point, like 222.50738585072011e-310? What about superfluous leading zeros in the exponent, like 2.2250738585072011e-0308? Your script doesn’t handle those.

     Yes, I was wrong about leading zeros in the exponent. But what about 2225.0738585072011e-311? 22250.738585072011e-312? What about trailing 0s before the exponent, like 2.22507385850720110e-308?

     @Rick

     Good Point. Changed the script to remove the “.” and changed the string that is searched for.

     <http://www.aircraft24.com/en/info/php-float-dos-quickfix.htm>

     Better now ?

     That will probably do it, if you change ‘250738585072011’ to ‘22250738585072011’.

     Done. Would have worked with “’250738585072011” as well but is less unlikely to catch “false positives” now.

     Yes, false positives were my concern.

     For those using Zend Server or Zend Server Community Edition, a hotfix was just released. I have installed it on 2 servers running PHP 5.3 on CentOS 5 and can confirm that the fix works.

     I am confused. Does this only affect people with older cpus that do not support SSE2?

     I do not seem to be affected by the bug, yet am on a 32 bit CPU and PHP was compiled with -O2.

     uname -a:

     Linux www 2.6.9-67.0.22.ELsmp #1 SMP Fri Jul 11 10:38:12 EDT 2008 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

     Running the test script outlined above comes back immediately. No hang.

     CPU is Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5430 @ 2.66GHz which support SSE2.

     Since my CPU supports SSE2, would I not be affected by this?

     @John Flax,

     This is a comment from Rasmus Lerdorf, in the bug report:

     “If you are on an architecture that uses the x87 FPU and you haven’t forced SSE or float-store then you will see this problem.”

     What version of PHP are you using?

     PHP ver is 5.2.14. As far as I know I have not forced float-store or SSE, unless Centos does that by default.

     Updated the workaround now:

     – handles arrays

     – terminates execution instead of deleting the offending variable

     – performance improved

     An official, proper fix for this has been committed. Who knows when the PHP team will release a new/updated version of PHP for this though.

     <http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/Zend/zend_strtod.c?r1=307095&r2=307094&pathrev=307095>

     The “”fix”” Rafi came up with is utter nonsense as well (so many edge cases which aren’t addressed). I’d recommend folks suffering from this put pressure on the PHP team to tag and distribute a new release rather than using horrid hacks like the one here: <http://www.aircraft24.com/en/info/php-float-dos-quickfix.htm>

     @koitsu

     Of course, patching or upgrading PHP to a fixed version is the way to go.

     We just wanted to provide protection for sites that cannot immediately fix their PHP-installation and that want to protect their server against script-kids that try around with GET and POST-vars. Our script does exactly that. It is not a fix but a workaround.

## Details

It was discovered that an integer overflow in the XML UTF-8 decoding

code could allow an attacker to bypass cross-site scripting (XSS)

protections. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, Ubuntu 8.04 LTS,

and Ubuntu 9.10. ([CVE-2009-5016](/security/CVE-2009-5016))

It was discovered that the XML UTF-8 decoding code did not properly

handle non-shortest form UTF-8 encoding and ill-formed subsequences

in UTF-8 data, which could allow an attacker to bypass cross-site

scripting (XSS) protections. ([CVE-2010-3870](/security/CVE-2010-3870))

It was discovered that attackers might be able to bypass open\_basedir()

restrictions by passing a specially crafted filename. ([CVE-2010-3436](/security/CVE-2010-3436))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that a NULL pointer derefence in the

ZIP archive handling code could allow an attacker to cause a denial

of service through a specially crafted ZIP archive. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and Ubuntu

10.10. ([CVE-2010-3709](/security/CVE-2010-3709))

It was discovered that a stack consumption vulnerability in the

filter\_var() PHP function when in FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL mode, could

allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and

Ubuntu 10.10. ([CVE-2010-3710](/security/CVE-2010-3710))

It was discovered that the mb\_strcut function in the Libmbfl

library within PHP could allow an attacker to read arbitrary memory

within the application process. This issue only affected Ubuntu

10.10. ([CVE-2010-4156](/security/CVE-2010-4156))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that an integer overflow in the

NumberFormatter::getSymbol function could allow an attacker to cause

a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 10.10. ([CVE-2010-4409](/security/CVE-2010-4409))

Rick Regan discovered that when handing PHP textual representations

of the largest subnormal double-precision floating-point number,

the zend\_strtod function could go into an infinite loop on 32bit

x86 processors, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2010-4645](/security/CVE-2010-4645))

I think so too but in any case it would rock if I could get a CVE #
asap, we are going to release 5.2.17/5.3.5 tomorrow (packaging now).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Here are the details from the Slackware 13.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/php-5.2.17-i486-1_slack13.1.txz:  Upgraded.   This update fixes an infinite loop with conversions from string to   double that may result in a denial of service.   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4645   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com? Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading directly from ftp.slackware.com.  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

Subject: possible flaw in widely used strtod.c implementation

hi,

Referring to: <http://bugs.php.net/53632>

This bug affects PHP and can be remotely triggered if someone actually
process an input as double (p.php?id=... and then $d
= $id +1 for example). However this issue could also affect any
software relying on the "strtod for IEEE-, VAX-, and IBM-arithmetic
machines." implementation (quite a lot actually do, according to
codesearch&co). See a non exhaustive list here:

<http://www.google.com/codesearch?as_q=strtod+for+IEEE-,+VAX-,+and+IBM-arithmetic+machines.&btnG=Search+Code&hl=en&as_package=&as_lang=&as_filename=&as_class=&as_function=&as_license=&as_case=>

Whether the bug exists in the respective builds of each of these
softwares may depend on how they are built (options, arch, etc.).

A fix is already in php's svn:
<http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=307095>

A good explanation about this issue is in the gcc bug tracker (thanks
Rasmus for the pointer):

It is a design flaw in the x87 fpu registers, so keeping the float out
of those registers circumvents the problem.  It is
one of the suggested ways of fixing this that is mentioned in the famous
gcc bug 323 report:

<http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=323>

See Comment 87:

 bruno 2006-12-21 15:08:57 UTC
 The option -ffloat-store, recommended by Richard Henderson, has
 the effect of decreasing the performance of floating-point
 operations for the entire compilation unit. If you want a minimal
 fix that does not affect other functions in the same compilation
 unit, you can use 'volatile double' instead of 'double'. It's
 like a one-shot -ffloat-store. Example:

 #include <stdio.h>

 void test(double x, double y) {
   const volatile double y2 = x + 1.0;
   if (y != y2) printf("error\n");
 }

 void main() {
   const double x = .012;
   const double y = x + 1.0;

   test(x, y);
 }

On windows it is slightly more complicated as it seems to do some more
under the wood work. I was able to reproduce the problem on certain
CPUs (i7) and not on other  (xeon) using the exact same binaries. I
still have to verify what is done exactly.

About getting a CVE #, I'm not sure it should be categorized only for
php or more generally about this strtod.c (newest version has the same
problem btw). Ideas? Comments?

Cheers,
--

I am using PHP 5.3.1 XAMPP 1.7.3 on Windows.  2.2250738585072011e-308 represents the largest subnormal double-precision floating-point number, 0.1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 x 2^-1022.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: possible flaw in widely used strtod.c implementation

hi,

Referring to: <http://bugs.php.net/53632>

This bug affects PHP and can be remotely triggered if someone actually
process an input as double (p.php?id=... and then $d
= $id +1 for example). However this issue could also affect any
software relying on the "strtod for IEEE-, VAX-, and IBM-arithmetic
machines." implementation (quite a lot actually do, according to
codesearch&co). See a non exhaustive list here:

<http://www.google.com/codesearch?as_q=strtod+for+IEEE-,+VAX-,+and+IBM-arithmetic+machines.&btnG=Search+Code&hl=en&as_package=&as_lang=&as_filename=&as_class=&as_function=&as_license=&as_case=>

Whether the bug exists in the respective builds of each of these
softwares may depend on how they are built (options, arch, etc.).

A fix is already in php's svn:
<http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=307095>

A good explanation about this issue is in the gcc bug tracker (thanks
Rasmus for the pointer):

It is a design flaw in the x87 fpu registers, so keeping the float out
of those registers circumvents the problem.  It is
one of the suggested ways of fixing this that is mentioned in the famous
gcc bug 323 report:

<http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=323>

See Comment 87:

 bruno 2006-12-21 15:08:57 UTC
 The option -ffloat-store, recommended by Richard Henderson, has
 the effect of decreasing the performance of floating-point
 operations for the entire compilation unit. If you want a minimal
 fix that does not affect other functions in the same compilation
 unit, you can use 'volatile double' instead of 'double'. It's
 like a one-shot -ffloat-store. Example:

 #include <stdio.h>

 void test(double x, double y) {
   const volatile double y2 = x + 1.0;
   if (y != y2) printf("error\n");
 }

 void main() {
   const double x = .012;
   const double y = x + 1.0;

   test(x, y);
 }

On windows it is slightly more complicated as it seems to do some more
under the wood work. I was able to reproduce the problem on certain
CPUs (i7) and not on other  (xeon) using the exact same binaries. I
still have to verify what is done exactly.

About getting a CVE #, I'm not sure it should be categorized only for
php or more generally about this strtod.c (newest version has the same
problem btw). Ideas? Comments?

Cheers,
--
Pierre

The template HTML files generated by this feature referenced a script file from a non-encrypted origin. An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to inject malicious scripts in the local domain if the user views a template file locally. This issue is resolved by removing the reference to an online script. This issue does not affect OS X Lion systems.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

See this thread:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/01/05/2>

"Since this problem stems from a single codebase, strtod.c, so it gets a
single CVE identifier (already assigned CVE-2010-4645).  The CVE
description will "blame" strtod.c and mention PHP, and any other
high-profile software that is discovered to use the same vulnerable,
shared code."

CVE-2010-4645 description currently in NVD is:

"strtod.c, as used in the zend_strtod function in PHP 5.2 before 5.2.17
and 5.3 before 5.3.5, and other products, allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a certain
floating-point value in scientific notation, which is not properly
handled in x87 FPU registers, as demonstrated using
2.2250738585072011e-308."

Interestingly, at least PHP's fix at the time wasn't to avoid the direct
comparison, but to avoid having the floating-point values stay in x87 FP
registers.  This should be sufficient to workaround GCC "bug" 323, but
it might not be robust across platforms and it does not fix CWE-1077.
