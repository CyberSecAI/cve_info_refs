Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw in the Ziggurat Farsi CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `grp` parameter of the `main.asp` page, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database. This could lead to:
    *   Data breaches, gaining access to sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Data manipulation, allowing modification or deletion of data within the database.
    *   Potential full compromise of the server via database command execution (if the database user has enough privileges).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `main.asp` page.
*   The specific vulnerable parameter is `grp`.
*   The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `grp` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No authentication or special privileges are mentioned as required for the attack.

**Technical Details:**

*   Vulnerable file: `http://server/main.asp?id=5945&grp=[SQL Injection]`
*   Platform: ASP

This exploit is fairly straightforward, targeting a known SQL injection vulnerability with a direct GET request.
