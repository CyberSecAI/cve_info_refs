{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'uri' parameter within the index.php file, leading to local file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the 'uri' parameter.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` with a crafted 'uri' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
