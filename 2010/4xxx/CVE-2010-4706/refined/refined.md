The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Linux-PAM, including CVE-2010-4706.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability (CVE-2010-4706):**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `check_acl()` function of the `pam_xauth` module. Specifically, it lacks a check to ensure that the ACL file provided by the target user is a regular file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Handling of ACL Files:** The `pam_xauth` module does not verify if the ACL file provided by a user is a regular file. This could allow the attacker to provide a symlink or other file type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   This could allow a local attacker to potentially perform a symlink attack, potentially leading to data loss or disclosure of sensitive information as mentioned in the Gentoo Security Advisory, although the specific impact for CVE-2010-4706 is not detailed beyond this general statement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A local attacker could manipulate the ACL file to be a symlink or other special file, instead of a regular file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user with the ability to specify an ACL file.

The Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 201206-31) mentions the impact as "data loss or disclosure of sensitive information" and lists CVE-2010-4706 as one of the related CVEs. The Openwall email specifically identifies the missing check in `check_acl()` function as the issue for CVE-2010-4706
