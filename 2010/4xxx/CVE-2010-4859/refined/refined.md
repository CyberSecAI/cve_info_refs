Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2010-4859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a blind SQL injection flaw in the `blog_id` parameter within the `index.php` file of WebAsys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `blog_id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code. Because the application does not display the results of the query directly, it's a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker must infer the results based on application response.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the `blog_id` parameter, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames (`U_ID`) and passwords (`U_PASSWORD`).
- **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** Attackers can gain access to partial confidential information in the database.
- **Partial Integrity Impact:** Attackers can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- **Partial Availability Impact:** Depending on the queries used, an attacker could make the database unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests by manipulating the `blog_id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WebAsys application to send HTTP requests.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit code demonstrates how the blind SQL injection works. It uses the `if` and `substring` functions in SQL queries to extract information character by character.

- The script first determines the length of the desired data (username or password).
- Then, it iterates through possible characters, and by observing the application response (presence/absence of "Subquery returns"), infers the actual character at each position.
- It does this by comparing the ASCII value of each character at each position of the targeted information (username or password).

**Exploit Example:**
The exploit code provided in the content demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords. It takes the URL of the vulnerable application and user ID as arguments.
```
php <script_name> <url> <user_id> <u/p>
```
- `url`: Target web application URL
- `user_id`: ID of the target user
- `u`: for username, `p`: for password

The exploit sends requests similar to:
```
<url>index.php?ukey=news&blog_id=if(ascii(substring((select+U_ID+from+WBS_USER+where+C_ID=<id>),<position>,1))=<ascii_value>,1,(select+1+union+select+2))
```

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit code uses `file_get_contents` to make the HTTP requests.
- It iterates to discover the length of targeted data first, then iterates through each character to retrieve the user info.
- The vulnerability exists in the `blog_id` parameter of the `index.php` file, which handles news content.
