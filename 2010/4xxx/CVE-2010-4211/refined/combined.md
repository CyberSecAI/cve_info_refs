### Not Friendly User - Will Lose Customers

> I have an e-commerce shop that offers different ways to pay. All different payment methods, but PayPal, goes automatically into my account. PayPal will charge a fee for using them. Automatically put limitations if youâre a new account, until you give them all the necessary documents to prove who are and what you do. And even with those limitations taken off, they hold your money because youâre new. You can even be a long time customer but if you havenât sold in awhile or some other silly reason, youâll run into this problem as well. Not only will they keep your money, but apparently my product doesnât qualify for their sellers protection program. So basically not only do I not get paid, but if the customer decides to claim they never received the package just so they can get their money back while keeping my product (because people like that do exist) or somebody did in fact steal their package, Iâm left without pay, while suffering loss of products, and canât be protected from it. And supposedly you have to check off their list of things they want you to do in order to receive those âprivilegesâ. Also no customer is going to want to wait for you to get their money and then send the product. So I either have to have faith in this customer, send the product anyway ahead of time, and hope PayPal will release the money in 24 hours. Thatâs one way of getting your money faster, but itâs not even guaranteed. Terrible service.

### Support is poor; communication is worse

> 1) Itâs really hard to get to someone when thereâs a problem. 2) it can take a long time for a transaction to clear even if itâs already cleared your bank but they act like it hasnât cleared the bank. 3) it will put out error messages that really have no meaning but say try again. I tried again and again only to find out they out a 72 hour block on transfers without notifying me - it looks like because I was on Microsoft defender VPN. BUT each time I tried again as their error message said to do, it reset the 72hour counter for the block they didnât notify me I was on. After waiting for a real person to get back to me, they didnât know why exactly I was on a block and other than it looked like I was away from home. 4) Resolution center doesnât have enough choices to cover the problems. 5) AI help is a regurgitative waste of time. 6) regular help is a repetitive waste of time. 7) they get to float my money longer for their benefit. 8) Support isnât consistent with their answer and vary from person to person. 9) donât use for crypto because they say they have no controls on their system to when transaction fail and trigger hood times not how long those hood time can be so if an attempt is made while on hold the hood can be extended. In my case itâs been over a week to try and transfer out some crypto but the indefinite hold has allowed the value to drop below what I needed it to be and still falling. Canât sell it or transfer it.

### unhelpful

> not only did paypal mark it as suspicious to log into my OWN account, even when i submitted all my information (which i checked was in there) my account was suddenly permanently limited, and i did not have any money in it, but i needed to close it for a certain bank, and i decided to check why such a thing was done, and found out some âpersonâ named âAlma Chamberlainâ was using my information alongside theirs. i obviously went to close the account, but guess what? paypal, with their excruciatingly slow website that froze even after their own notification came up, wouldnât let me close my account, leaving this random âpersonâ with full access to all the banks and cards linked to it i still use someplace in Ohio. after all this, i went to just log into my current account that uses a different social email, and i gave the face id activated, and for some reason it struggled to recognize me in proper lighting looking directly at it, so i entered the password instead, which was correct, and all of a sudden paypal locks me out of that account, and says it was âsuspiciousâ, and that account does in fact have funds in it (which paypal wouldnât let me transfer anyway because of the old one i tried to close) so now i will go lock all of my accounts, solely because paypal has been more of a disservice to me than even close to helpful, and all this is surface level, iâve even left out details. paypal is too internally flawed to make a proper banking app.
