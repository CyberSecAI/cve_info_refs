Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-4396:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `HandleAction` method of the RealPlayer ActiveX control, specifically with CLSID `FDC7A535-4070-4B92-A0EA-D9994BCC0DC5`. The vulnerable action that can be invoked is `NavigateToURL`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Zone Scripting:** The core issue is that the `NavigateToURL` function in RealPlayer's ActiveX control can be manipulated to execute scripts in the Local Zone, typically a more privileged security context than the Internet Zone from where the action is initiated.
- **Uncontrolled File Access:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to control the target URL of the `NavigateToURL` action. Specifically, if this target URL can point to a file on the user's local system that the attacker controls, they can execute malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running RealPlayer. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** The attack requires the victim to navigate to a malicious web page. This implies that this is a client-side vulnerability that can be exploited via web browsers that support ActiveX controls.
- **Maliciously Crafted Skin File:**  The attack involves forcing a download of a specially crafted skin file to a predictable location on the user's system. This file acts as the malicious script payload. Then using `NavigateToURL` to execute scripts in the local zone.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, not requiring any physical access to the victim's system.
- **Malicious Website/Content:** The attacker needs to host or have access to a web page containing the exploit code. This code forces the download of the skin file and manipulates the ActiveX control.
- **Knowledge of File Locations:** The attacker needs to know or predict the location where the downloaded skin file will be saved to point `NavigateToURL` to it.
- **User Interaction:** The user must visit the attacker's malicious web page. This implies that some form of social engineering to get users to visit the webpage is needed

**Additional details from the content:**
