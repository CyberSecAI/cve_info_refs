- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `event_id` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application. No special privileges or authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability based on the provided information. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the Joomla component and how to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit provided demonstrates how to extract user credentials by using a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement.
- A related CVE, CVE-2010-2513, is also mentioned, suggesting there may be similar vulnerabilities in the same component or related software.
