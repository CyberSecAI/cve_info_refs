**Vulnerability:** CVE-2010-4783 is related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Easy Banner Free.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `index.php` script of Easy Banner Free. Specifically, the `siteurl` and `urlbanner` parameters are vulnerable to XSS attacks. The script performs weak validation on these parameters. For `siteurl` it only checks if "http://" is present at the beginning, and for `urlbanner` it checks if an image extension is present at the end, but doesn't sanitize the input against XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is susceptible to XSS attacks via the `siteurl` and `urlbanner` parameters.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode the input received from user parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application by crafting malicious URLs. This code could potentially:
    *   Steal user cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Parameters:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code within the `siteurl` and `urlbanner` URL parameters of the `index.php` script.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to access a crafted link with the malicious javascript in the URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   The attacker must get a victim to click the crafted link.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via a web browser.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable parameters:** `siteurl` and `urlbanner` in `index.php`.
*   **Site URL XSS PoC:** `http://"><script>alert(XSS)</script><aa aa="`
*   **Banner URL XSS PoC:** `"><script>alert(XSS)</script><aa aa=".gif`
*   **Condition:** `magic_quotes_gpc = off`

**Solution:** The vendor, PHP Web Scripts, has updated Easy Banner Free to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to download the latest version from the vendor's website.
