How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This patch updates the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 kernel to fix
various security issues and some bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-4242: The hci\_uart\_tty\_open function in the HCI UART driver
(drivers/bluetooth/hci\_ldisc.c) in the Linux kernel did not verify
whether the tty has a write operation, which allowed local users
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via vectors
related to the Bluetooth driver.
CVE-2010-4527: The load\_mixer\_volumes function in sound/oss/soundcard.c
in the OSS sound subsystem in the Linux kernel incorrectly expected
that a certain name field ends with a '\0' character, which allowed
local users to conduct buffer overflow attacks and gain privileges,
or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, via a
SOUND\_MIXER\_SETLEVELS ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4529: Integer underflow in the irda\_getsockopt function in
net/irda/af\_irda.c in the Linux kernel on platforms other than x86
allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from
kernel heap memory via an IRLMP\_ENUMDEVICES getsockopt call.
CVE-2010-4342: The aun\_incoming function in net/econet/af\_econet.c in
the Linux kernel, when Econet is enabled, allowed remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS)
by sending an Acorn Universal Networking (AUN) packet over UDP.
CVE-2010-2946: fs/jfs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
handle a certain legacy format for storage of extended attributes,
which might have allowed local users by bypass intended xattr namespace
restrictions via an "os2." substring at the beginning of a name.
CVE-2010-3848: Stack-based buffer overflow in the econet\_sendmsg
function in net/econet/af\_econet.c in the Linux kernel, when an
econet address is configured, allowed local users to gain privileges
by providing a large number of iovec structures.
CVE-2010-3849: The econet\_sendmsg function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel, when an econet address is configured, allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
and OOPS) via a sendmsg call that specifies a NULL value for the
remote address field.
CVE-2010-3850: The ec\_dev\_ioctl function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel does not require the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability,
which allowed local users to bypass intended access restrictions and
configure econet addresses via an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4258: The do\_exit function in kernel/exit.c in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle a KERNEL\_DS get\_fs value, which
allowed local users to bypass intended access\_ok restrictions,
overwrite arbitrary kernel memory locations, and gain privileges by
leveraging a (1) BUG, (2) NULL pointer dereference, or (3) page fault,
as demonstrated by vectors involving the clear\_child\_tid feature and
the splice system call.
CVE-2010-4160: Multiple integer overflows in the (1) pppol2tp\_sendmsg
function in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c, and the (2) l2tp\_ip\_sendmsg function
in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ip.c, in the PPPoL2TP and IPoL2TP implementations
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption and panic) or possibly gain privileges via
a crafted sendto call.
CVE-2010-4157: Integer overflow in the ioc\_general function in
drivers/scsi/gdth.c in the Linux kernel on 64-bit platforms allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a large argument in an ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4164: Multiple integer underflows in the x25\_parse\_facilities
function in net/x25/x25\_facilities.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via malformed
X.25 (1) X25\_FAC\_CLASS\_A, (2) X25\_FAC\_CLASS\_B, (3) X25\_FAC\_CLASS\_C,
or (4) X25\_FAC\_CLASS\_D facility data, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2010-3873.
CVE-2010-4158: The sk\_run\_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the
Linux kernel did not check whether a certain memory location has been
initialized before executing a (1) BPF\_S\_LD\_MEM or (2) BPF\_S\_LDX\_MEM
instruction, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel stack memory via a crafted socket filter.
CVE-2010-3442: Multiple integer overflows in the snd\_ctl\_new function
in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted (1) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD or
(2) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_REPLACE ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4081: The snd\_hdspm\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSPM\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
CVE-2010-3067: Integer overflow in the do\_io\_submit function in
fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted use
of the io\_submit system call.
CVE-2010-3310: Multiple integer signedness errors in net/rose/af\_rose.c
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a rose\_getname function call, related to the rose\_bind and
rose\_connect functions.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

## CVE-2010-4242: Linux kernel Bluetooth HCI UART Invalid Pointer Access

[with 2 comments](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/12/01/cve-2010-4242-linux-kernel-bluetooth-hci-uart-invalid-pointer-access/#comments)

[Reported](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=641410) by Eugene Teo, this issue is about Bluetooth HCI UART driver and specifically, a missing check during TTY opening code. Its code is available at drivers/bluetooth/hci\_ldisc.c and below is the buggy function.

```

/* ------ LDISC part ------ */
/* hci_uart_tty_open
 *
 *     Called when line discipline changed to HCI_UART.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *     tty    pointer to tty info structure
 * Return Value:
 *     0 if success, otherwise error code
 */
static int hci_uart_tty_open(struct tty_struct *tty)
{
        struct hci_uart *hu = (void *) tty->disc_data;

        BT_DBG("tty %p", tty);

        if (hu)
                return -EEXIST;

        if (!(hu = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hci_uart), GFP_KERNEL))) {
                BT_ERR("Can't allocate control structure");
                return -ENFILE;
        }

         tty->disc_data = hu;
        hu->tty = tty;
        tty->receive_room = 65536;

        spin_lock_init(&hu->rx_lock);

        /* Flush any pending characters in the driver and line discipline. */

        /* FIXME: why is this needed. Note don't use ldisc_ref here as the
           open path is before the ldisc is referencable */

        if (tty->ldisc->ops->flush_buffer)
                tty->ldisc->ops->flush_buffer(tty);
        tty_driver_flush_buffer(tty);

        return 0;
}

```

And the patch was:

```

        BT_DBG("tty %p", tty);

+       /* FIXME: This btw is bogus, nothing requires the old ldisc to clear
+          the pointer */
        if (hu)
                return -EEXIST;

+       /* Error if the tty has no write op instead of leaving an exploitable
+          hole */
+       if (tty->ops->write == NULL)
+               return -EOPNOTSUPP;
+
        if (!(hu = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hci_uart), GFP_KERNEL))) {
                BT_ERR("Can't allocate control structure");

```

Alan Cox stated that “this is only exploitable on very unusual hardware” where there is no write operation initialized allowing the user to perform a very straightforward privilege escalation exploit.

1. How exactly would this be a “very straightforward privilege escalation exploit”? Unless you have some secret way of getting around mmap\_min\_addr, this is just a DoS.

3. I guess your question was rhetorical since you gave the answer.

   Many of the people you mock on certain IRC channels also have some “secrets”.

## [BSidesBUD 2023: A Deeper Look at the Disrupted Bot Farms in Ukraine](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/02/bsidesbud-2023-a-deeper-look-at-the-disrupted-bot-farms-in-ukraine/)

It would probably take us many years to look into all the intricate details of the countless cyber operations that are taking place globally in relation to the Ukraine/Russia conflict the last couple of years. As a tiny step towards that direction, in 2023 I did some research on how Russian intelligence services have been setting up and utilising “bot farms” inside Ukraine.

Eventually, I was accepted to present this research at BSidesBUD 2023. A really nice event at the capital of Hungary that I’d definitely recommend to everyone from our industry.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsidesbud_2023.jpg?w=1024)

In case you want to get an idea of the content, below I’m attaching the slides that I used. However, the slides were mostly to support my presentation so they do not have that much value on their own. Nevertheless, it was a subject that I hadn’t come across in any security conference before, so I thought it’s worth documenting for future reference.

## [Kaspersky SAS ’23](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/kaspersky-sas-23/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/kaspersky-sas-23/#respond)

I’m always seeking to learn and experience different cyber security events since each one of them gives you a different perspective of our industry (and the world), and Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS), was in my “*to do*” list for a long time.

I planned to attend SAS in 2018-2019 but due to some competing priorities, I couldn’t. Then, in 2020 I applied to do a presentation titled “cyber-crime ecosystem in the travel industry” which was accepted, but the conference was cancelled due to the pandemic, and in 2023 it was the first time since the pandemic that SAS was back. So, after 5 years, I finally managed to attend the SAS ’23 which took place in Phuket, Thailand and was a wonderful, small, security conference.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1.png?w=1024)

It was a relatively small event with a couple of hundred of people or so. But the content was incredible. From all sorts of APTs that you rarely hear about, to innovative research, and of course having the ability network and chat with professionals from national CERTs as well as security researchers from countries rarely present in the well-known US and European cyber security events, with a truly amazing organisation, lots of activities and surprises.

As security professionals it’s imperative that we understand the threat landscape globally, and this event was a remarkable place to gain that insight for anyone coming from US or EU background. Both from the defenders and the attackers’ perspective, the event included very interesting TTPs and content that I hadn’t seen before.

Lastly, as Eugene Kaspersky put it in one of the conference activities, a great security conference needs to have: 1) new and innovative security research/content; 2) be hosted in a nice environment/location that allows people to disconnect from their day-to-day work; and 3) be fun. SAS ’23 managed to cover all three areas successfully.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sas23.jpg?w=1024)

It’s hard to choose my favourite talks from this event, but if I had to pick 5 (in no particular order), based on the knowledge I acquired from them, those would be:

* **StripedFly: Traversing the Blue Expanse in Search of Eternal Wonders**
  + by Sergey Belov and Sergey Lozhkin (Kaspersky GReAT)
* **How Many Gates to the Temple of Space? Shapes of Tunnels Drilled by Desecrators**
  + by Askar Dyussekeyev (KZ-CERT)
* **Unearthing TetrisPhantom: Discovering secrets of an intricate cyber threat campaign**
  + by Noushin Shabab (Kaspersky GReAT)
* **Operation Triangulation: Сonnecting the Dots**
  + by Igor Kuznetsov (Kaspersky)
* **Space Pirates: raiders of privacy**
  + by Denis Kuvshinov (Positive Technologies)

## [2022 CTI-EU Talk: Threat Landscape and Defences Against Mobile Surveillance Implants](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/2022-cti-eu-talk-threat-landscape-and-defences-against-mobile-surveillance-implants/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/2022-cti-eu-talk-threat-landscape-and-defences-against-mobile-surveillance-implants/#respond)

In December 2022 I had a very pleasant surprise, I was given an opportunity to give a lightning talk at the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) conference of 2022, known as **CTI-EU 2022**. I had attended previous editions of this event and it was an amazing experience, so having that opportunity was a great honour.

I had a few different topics that I was researching around that time and after a small discussion with the organisers we agreed that the best option would be the “Threat Landscape and Defences Against Mobile Surveillance Implants”.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.png?w=800)

If you’d like to see what other presentations took place during the CTI-EU 2022, check out the [published agenda](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2022-cti-eu-conference-1/enisa-cti-eu-conference-agenda.pdf) for the event. There were some very valuable presentations, but of course, being an on-site event, the most important part was the face-to-face interactions. With this event ENISA manages to bring public and private sector CTI experts together and we had numerous fruitful conversations ranging from CTI topics, to public/private sector collaborations, challenges, and more.

I’m not sure if/when ENISA will publish the slides from the TLP:WHITE talks, but if you’d like to see mine you can get them here. Apparently, being a lightning talk I couldn’t go in-depth in almost anything, but if you are interested in something mentioned in my slides (but with more depth), please contact me. Additionally, if you are researching this space and would like a second pair of eyes, I’d be more than happy to help.

## [OSINT: A Summary of SIDEWINDER Operations in 2022](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/osint-a-summary-of-sidewinder-operations-in-2022/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/osint-a-summary-of-sidewinder-operations-in-2022/#respond)

SIDEWINDER (also known as RAZOR TIGER, RATTLESNAKE, T-APT-04, HARDCORE NATIONALIST, and APT-C-17) is a cyber espionage actor who has been active at least since 2012. I had a look on all the publicly known 2022 operations (that I could find) attributed to this actor to derive some insights and here’s the outcome.

The main outcome we can derive is that SIDEWINDER is focusing mainly on Pakistani military targets (particularly the Navy) to conduct cyber espionage.

In terms of the data I used, through publicly available information I found 40 unique events (let’s call them operations) for the period of January 2022-December 2022 and here are some statistics…

**Note**: Apparently this is a tiny number compared to [Kaspersky’s](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/sidewinder-hackers-launched-over-1000.html) “*over 1,000 new attacks since April 2020*” but I tried to keep it limited to 2022, publicly available reports, and only those that had some context. Not just IOCs.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_target_countries.jpg?w=851)

*Figure 1: Countries targeted by SIDEWINDER*

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_targeted_sectors.jpg?w=769)

*Figure 2: Sectors targeted by SIDEWINDER*

Many identify SIDEWINDER as an Indian cyber espionage actor and based on the targets of *Figure 1* and *Figure 2* I’d say that we can safely assume that their main target is Pakistani military entities which makes this actor better aligned with what a military intelligence agency would be performing. Maybe something like India’s [Directorate of Military Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Military_Intelligence_%28India%29)? Apparently, there are no hard evidence here to be certain about this, just some food for thought.

Considering the main target is the Pakistani military, here’s a breakdown of the specific SIDEWINDER targets in Pakistan from the limited 2022 dataset I mentioned in the introduction.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_breakdown_of_pakistani_targets.jpg?w=976)

*Figure 3: Volumetric analysis of top SIDEWINDER targets in Pakistan*

Based on that limited dataset, clearly the Pakistani Navy was by far the top target of SIDEWINDER for 2022, strengthening the hypothesis of SIDEWINDER being an actor associated with India’s military intelligence, or even naval intelligence.

With such small sample sets, timelines aren’t particularly valuable but I know that people will be asking for it so here is a timeline analysis too.

## [BSides Cyprus: Cloud… Just somebody else’s computer](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/bsides-cyprus-cloud-just-somebody-elses-computer/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/bsides-cyprus-cloud-just-somebody-elses-computer/#respond)

Just noticed that I haven’t published much for the last few talks I’ve been giving and this is one of them…

That was my 8th, and last, talk for 2021. It was a research more on the cloud security architect/engineering side. That was my second time participating in [BSides Cyprus](https://twitter.com/BsidesCyprus), and as always, it was an amazing event with amazing people. The organizers of BSides Cyprus did a remarkable job. From the set up of the remote event, to the CTF, the prizes for the CTF participants, and the overall atmosphere, it was an excellent event.

Now specifically on my talk, that was a subject that I was preparing for around a year and I’m glad I got to talk about it in BSides Cyprus. For various reasons, public cloud providers are intentionally abstracting lots of the plumbing on how everything is put together and how does this affect security.

So, in this talk I picked up a few services from AWS, GCP, and Azure and dissected them to demonstrate that:

* It’s just computers and software under the hood
* How having this “inner” architectural understanding helps you uncover vulnerabilities (using some publicly available ones in the examples, no 0days or embargoed issues revealed)

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bsidescyprus21.jpg?w=1024)

My goal with this talk wasn’t to uncover some significant design flaw or claim that public cloud is bad. Just to raise awareness and change the mindset of security engineers when working with public cloud to think beyond what the vendor’s documentation says. If you’d like to have a look, you can find my [slides here](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cloud...-just-somebody-elses-computer.pdf).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

My gut feeling is that for mostx86 boxes the worst will be an Oops or very bizarre behaviour because theywon't have any suitable serial ports you can hit or have permission toaccess.tiocmget needs a file pointer because some devices check for hangupshere. Now in fact it would actually make sense to move that into the corecode and see if we can kill the file pointer but right now it doesn'tseem safe.The ioctl helper stuff can either use the ugly set_fs hackery or betteryet shove a helper in the kernel tree to get or set kernel termios whichjust takes a struct ktermios and does the right mutex locks and ops callschecks for NULL ops.I can find no record of this code having been anywhere nearlinux-kernel/linux-serial, which is a pity because after we'd mopped upour spilled drinks the bug would have been reported.Fortunately I looked further and the further I looked the more fun it getsin hci_uart we have                len = tty->ops->write(tty, skb->data, skb->len);but I can't find anywhere we check that the tty has a write op (a fewdon't), and you should check this at open and refuse if the ops you needdon't exist (eg as SLIP does:static int slip_open(struct tty_struct *tty){        struct slip *sl;        int err;        if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN))                return -EPERM;        if (tty->ops->write == NULL)                return -EOPNOTSUPP;Fortunately almost no system will have a driver loaded which lacks awrite op, but this should be fixed.Alan ``` | \ |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## CVE-2010-4242: Linux kernel Bluetooth HCI UART Invalid Pointer Access

[with 2 comments](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/12/01/cve-2010-4242-linux-kernel-bluetooth-hci-uart-invalid-pointer-access/#comments)

[Reported](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=641410) by Eugene Teo, this issue is about Bluetooth HCI UART driver and specifically, a missing check during TTY opening code. Its code is available at drivers/bluetooth/hci\_ldisc.c and below is the buggy function.

```

/* ------ LDISC part ------ */
/* hci_uart_tty_open
 *
 *     Called when line discipline changed to HCI_UART.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *     tty    pointer to tty info structure
 * Return Value:
 *     0 if success, otherwise error code
 */
static int hci_uart_tty_open(struct tty_struct *tty)
{
        struct hci_uart *hu = (void *) tty->disc_data;

        BT_DBG("tty %p", tty);

        if (hu)
                return -EEXIST;

        if (!(hu = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hci_uart), GFP_KERNEL))) {
                BT_ERR("Can't allocate control structure");
                return -ENFILE;
        }

         tty->disc_data = hu;
        hu->tty = tty;
        tty->receive_room = 65536;

        spin_lock_init(&hu->rx_lock);

        /* Flush any pending characters in the driver and line discipline. */

        /* FIXME: why is this needed. Note don't use ldisc_ref here as the
           open path is before the ldisc is referencable */

        if (tty->ldisc->ops->flush_buffer)
                tty->ldisc->ops->flush_buffer(tty);
        tty_driver_flush_buffer(tty);

        return 0;
}

```

And the patch was:

```

        BT_DBG("tty %p", tty);

+       /* FIXME: This btw is bogus, nothing requires the old ldisc to clear
+          the pointer */
        if (hu)
                return -EEXIST;

+       /* Error if the tty has no write op instead of leaving an exploitable
+          hole */
+       if (tty->ops->write == NULL)
+               return -EOPNOTSUPP;
+
        if (!(hu = kzalloc(sizeof(struct hci_uart), GFP_KERNEL))) {
                BT_ERR("Can't allocate control structure");

```

Alan Cox stated that “this is only exploitable on very unusual hardware” where there is no write operation initialized allowing the user to perform a very straightforward privilege escalation exploit.

1. How exactly would this be a “very straightforward privilege escalation exploit”? Unless you have some secret way of getting around mmap\_min\_addr, this is just a DoS.

3. I guess your question was rhetorical since you gave the answer.

   Many of the people you mock on certain IRC channels also have some “secrets”.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
