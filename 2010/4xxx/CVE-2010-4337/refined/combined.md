The configure script creates temporary files in an insecure way:

$ grep -A 7 '$$' gnash-0.8.8/configure
cerr=/tmp/gnash-configure-errors.$$
cwarn=/tmp/gnash-configure-warnings.$$
crec=/tmp/gnash-configure-recommended.$$
echo ""

#trap 'rm cerr' 0 # trap isn't a good idea, might override other traps
exec 3> $cerr

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : gnash
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local / local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4337 CVE-2011-4328 CVE-2012-1175
Debian Bug     : 605419 649384 664023

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in Gnash, the GNU Flash
player.

CVE-2012-1175

  Tielei Wang from Georgia Tech Information Security Center discovered a
  vulnerability in GNU Gnash which is caused due to an integer overflow
  error and can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by
  tricking a user into opening a specially crafted SWF file.

CVE-2011-4328

  Alexander Kurtz discovered an unsafe management of HTTP cookies. Cookie
  files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, vulnerability
  that allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files the users has
  write permissions for, and are also world-readable which may cause
  information leak.

CVE-2010-4337

  Jakub Wilk discovered an unsafe management of temporary files during the
  build process. Files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names,
  vulnerability that allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files
  the users has write permissions for.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8-5+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnash packages.
