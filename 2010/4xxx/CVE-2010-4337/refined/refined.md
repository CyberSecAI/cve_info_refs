```
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `configure` script in gnash creates temporary files in the `/tmp` directory with predictable names based on the process ID ($$).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure temporary file creation: The script uses `/tmp` for temporary files (cerr, cwarn, crec) with predictable names, making them vulnerable to symlink attacks.
- Predictable file names: The use of $$ in the file names makes it easy for an attacker to guess the names of the temporary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local users can overwrite arbitrary files: By creating symlinks to other files with the same name before the vulnerable script runs, an attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system where they have write access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable `configure` script is executed.
- Symlink attack: The attacker creates symbolic links in `/tmp` pointing to target files before the `configure` script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user account on the target system.
- Ability to create symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory.
- Ability to execute the vulnerable `configure` script.
