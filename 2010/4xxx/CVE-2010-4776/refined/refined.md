Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `takefreestart.php` script of the "Pre Online Tests Generator Pro" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`tid2` parameter) before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords of administrators.
*   **Potential for Full System Compromise:** Depending on the database privileges and the specific SQL dialect being used, it might be possible to write to the file system and gain command execution on the server
*  **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial
*   **Integrity Impact:** Partial
*  **Availability Impact:** Partial

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `takefreestart.php` with the vulnerable `tid2` parameter.
*   **Malicious SQL Injection:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `tid2` parameter using a `UNION SELECT` statement, allowing them to retrieve data from the `admin` table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, meaning they don't need local access to the server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit doesn't require any prior authentication.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter** attacker must identify the parameter that is vulnerable.
*   **HTTP interaction:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Exploit Details:**

*   The provided exploit URL demonstrates how an attacker could use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract admin credentials from the database.

```
http://target/path/takefreestart.php?tid=242&tid2=-1+union+select+1,2,3,group_concat(user_name,0x3a,user_pass),5,6,7,8+from+admin--&nxtq=true&q_no=1
```
