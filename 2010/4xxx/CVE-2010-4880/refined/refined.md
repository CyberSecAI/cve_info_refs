Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the ApPHP Calendar application. Specifically, the `category_name`, `category_description`, `event_name`, and `event_description` parameters are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application. This could lead to the execution of malicious code in a victim's browser.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks because it does not properly validate requests, enabling an attacker to trick a user into performing unwanted actions without their consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*  **CSRF:** An attacker can potentially modify calendar entries, create new events, or manipulate other calendar data without the user's knowledge or authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker can exploit the vulnerability via a POST request to the `calendar.php` file. The vulnerable parameters are `category_name`, `category_description`, `event_name`, and `event_description`.
*   An attacker could craft malicious links or forms to trick users into submitting the malicious data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP POST requests, including the vulnerable parameters, to the application.
*   For CSRF, the attacker needs to trick a user into executing a malicious request while the user is authenticated to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor is ApPHP.
*   The affected product is ApPHP Calendar.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the application.
*   The identified vulnerability is rated as a medium risk.
*   The vulnerability is remote (can be exploited from outside of the target system).
*   The advisory links to external resources that confirm the vulnerability including securityfocus and packetstorm.
