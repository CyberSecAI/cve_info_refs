Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the DBSite CMS. The `id` parameter in the `index.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi), which allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries sent to the database.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords. This can lead to further compromise of the system.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web application, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.  The exploit uses a crafted URL to inject SQL code. Example: `http://www.site.it/index.php?id=[SQLi]`.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific position is required besides network connectivity to the target web server.
