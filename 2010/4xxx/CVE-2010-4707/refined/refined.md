Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4707:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents mention CVE-2010-4707 in the context of multiple vulnerabilities found in Linux-PAM. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary root cause for CVE-2010-4707 and related vulnerabilities in Linux-PAM stems from insufficient privilege dropping and validation issues when handling files or programs provided by target users. Specifically, `pam_xauth` module is vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unprivileged File Operations:** In `pam_sm_close_session()`, the code attempts to unlink a cookie file without dropping privileges if the target user ID cannot be determined. This could allow a local user to manipulate the file system in an unexpected way, especially when running as root.
    *   **Missing Regular File Check:** In `check_acl()`, the code does not verify if the ACL file provided by the target user is a regular file, potentially enabling symlink attacks or other file system manipulation.
    *   **Buffer overflow, symlink attacks, data loss/disclosure of sensitive information:** other vulnerabilities mentioned in the Gentoo Security Advisory, not detailed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Local attackers could potentially escalate their privileges to root due to the lack of proper privilege dropping.
    *   **Denial of Service:** A local user might be able to cause a denial of service.
    *   **Data Corruption/Loss:** Attackers could potentially cause data loss or corruption by manipulating files or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the program interacts with file systems.
    *   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** A malicious local user could potentially obtain sensitive information via symlink attacks or by exploiting vulnerabilities that allow access to files they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local access:** Attackers need to have local access to the system.
    *   **Specially crafted files:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities by providing crafted files, including symlinks, or manipulating files used in authentication processes.
    *   **Specially crafted programs:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities by providing specially crafted programs that interact with vulnerable PAM modules.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have local user access to the system.
    *   The attacker must be able to provide or control files used by Linux-PAM.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201206-31) consolidates multiple CVEs affecting Linux-PAM, including CVE-2010-4707. The advisory emphasizes the need to upgrade to version 1.1.5 or later to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The Openwall mailing list archive provides information about specific patches that address certain issues in pam\_xauth, however these are not the only fixes needed.
*   The vulnerabilities are primarily relevant to local attackers, meaning they must have access to the system to exploit them.

In summary, CVE-2010-4707 and the associated issues in Linux-PAM represent a significant local security risk. The vulnerabilities stem from inadequate privilege dropping and validation checks within the PAM framework, leading to potential privilege escalation, denial of service, data corruption, and sensitive information disclosure if exploited. The main attack vectors involve specially crafted files provided by the local user.
