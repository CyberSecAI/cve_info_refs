# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on

# CVE-2010-4334

| **Name** | CVE-2010-4334 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The IO::Socket::SSL module 1.35 for Perl, when verify\_mode is not VERIFY\_NONE, fails open to VERIFY\_NONE instead of throwing an error when a ca\_file/ca\_path cannot be verified, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended certificate restrictions. |

Package: libio-socket-ssl-perl
Version: 1.34-1
Severity: normal
Tags: patch , security

Using IO::Socket::SSL, if i set verify_mode to 0x03 (verify peer, fail
verification if no peer certificate exists), these requests are
removed unless i also supply either ca_file or ca_path.

This is demonstrably the wrong behavior if (for example) the user
supplies a verify_callback.

It also means that IO::Socket::SSL "fails open" if the user simply
forgets to supply information about the acceptable set of "trusted"
CAs -- which seems like a particularly bad thing for a module whose
explicit purpose is improving communications security.

While i'm glad that the module carps that it is failing open, there is
nothing in the documentation to suggest that this behavior will
happen, and, well, it just seems wrong that it happens in the first
place.

I'm attaching two (mutually exclusive) patches to resolve this.

The first patch (default-to-etc-ssl-certs.patch) is less aggressive --
if the user sets verify_mode to a non-zero value, but does not supply
either ca_file or ca_path, it uses /etc/ssl/certs as ca_path -- this
is managed by the sysadmin on debian systems, and is usually populated
by the ca-certificates package.

The second patch (no-default-ca-certs.patch) simply doesn't check for
this condition at all, and allows the underlying library to make the
decision.

Of the two patches, i prefer no-default-ca-certs.patch.

The documentation makes references to ca/ and certs/my-ca.pem -- if
these are actually used by the tool, then no-default-ca-certs.patch is
definitely the way to go.

Hrm, as i look at it further, i'm not entirely sure that
no-default-ca-certs operates as expected with users who relying on the
defaults of ca/ or certs/my-ca.pem.

I do think that IO::Socket::SSL needs to fail *closed* though, and not
revert to accepting unverified connections in the event that the user
forgets to specify CAs (or fails to correctly populate the default
locations).

Hi Dominic

Not yet checked, at least me, so far I have done only first unstable,
now t-p-u upload. I add Moritz, in case he already did?

In lenny we have:

---(snip)---------------------------------------------------------------
    my $verify_mode = $arg_hash->{SSL_verify_mode};
    unless ($verify_mode == Net::SSLeay::VERIFY_NONE()) {
        Net::SSLeay::CTX_load_verify_locations(
            $ctx, $arg_hash->{SSL_ca_file},$arg_hash->{SSL_ca_path}
        ) || return IO::Socket::SSL->error("Invalid certificate authority locations");
    }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here we do not change the verify_mode. So IMHO lenny should be ok,
right?

Bests
Salvatore

I'm not familiar with the details of the problem, but this sounds
plausible. Thanks for checking.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
