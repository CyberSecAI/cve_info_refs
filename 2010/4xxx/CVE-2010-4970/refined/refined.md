Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2010-4970:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `getpage.php` file of WikiWebHelp 0.28 where user input from the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows for SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `getpage.php` due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, including sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This can be used to take complete control of the application and potentially the underlying server.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the ability to extract user credentials from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `handlers/getpage.php`, injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.
   - Example: `http://server/handlers/getpage.php?id=9999999+UNION+SELECT+1,CONCAT_WS(0x3a,user_name,password),3,4,5,6,7+FROM+user+LIMIT+1`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WikiWebHelp instance. No special privileges are needed to exploit the SQL injection.
