| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=672420#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-01-25 04:02:29 UTC  ``` If the iowarrior devices in this case statement support more than 8 bytes per report, it is possible to write past the end of a kernel heap allocation. This will probably never be possible, but change the allocation to be more defensive anyway.  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/3ed780117dbe5acb64280d218f0347f238dafed0>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Kees Cook for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=672420#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-01-25 05:16:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they do not have support for the I/O-Warrior USB devices. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html>. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=672420#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-03-10 20:05:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2011:0330 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=672420#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-08 02:57:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0421 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0421.html>   ``` |  |

# USN-1146-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

9 June 2011

Multiple flaws fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Kees Cook discovered that some ethtool functions did not correctly clear

heap memory. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could exploit

this to read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2010-4655](/security/CVE-2010-4655))

Kees Cook discovered that the IOWarrior USB device driver did not correctly

check certain size fields. A local attacker with physical access could plug

in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system or potentially gain

root privileges. ([CVE-2010-4656](/security/CVE-2010-4656))

Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly

clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could

exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of

privacy. ([CVE-2011-0463](/security/CVE-2011-0463))

Jens Kuehnel discovered that the InfiniBand driver contained a race

condition. On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send

specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2011-0695](/security/CVE-2011-0695))

Rafael Dominguez Vega discovered that the caiaq Native Instruments USB

driver did not correctly validate string lengths. A local attacker with

physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash the

system or potentially gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-0712](/security/CVE-2011-0712))

Timo Warns discovered that LDM partition parsing routines did not correctly

calculate block counts. A local attacker with physical access could plug in

a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2011-1012](/security/CVE-2011-1012))

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not

correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk

device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.

([CVE-2011-1017](/security/CVE-2011-1017))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle

large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1593](/security/CVE-2011-1593))

Subject: CVE request: linux kernel heap issues

Hello,

I don't think these minor issues I reported to the Linux Kernel have
had CVEs assigned to them:

heap contents leak for CAP_NET_ADMIN via ethtool ioctl
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=b00916b189d13a615ff05c9242201135992fcda3>

iowarrior usb device heap overflow
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=3ed780117dbe5acb64280d218f0347f238dafed0>

Thanks,

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
