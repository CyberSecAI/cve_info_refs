The provided content relates to **CVE-2010-3037** and **CVE-2010-3038**, not CVE-2010-4302.  Therefore, this response will not include information for CVE-2010-4302

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2010-3038):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Three accounts ("root", "cs", and "develop") have static, unchangeable passwords.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Hardcoded credentials that cannot be disabled or changed by administrators.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access via FTP and SSH.
*   **Services Misconfiguration:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Misconfigured services and permissions.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  FTP daemon (vsftpd) running with unclear purpose, user credentials created through the web interface allow filesystem exploration, `/etc/shadow` has read permissions for all users, and SSH daemon (openssh) allows port forwarding, SOCKS proxies, and X11 forwarding with restricted shells. Additionally, the web interface runs as root.
    *    **Impact:** Allows attackers to explore the filesystem/firmware, gain unauthorized access via SSH, and potentially elevate privileges.
*  **Weak Session IDs:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Session IDs are based on timestamps and are easily forged.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Predictable session IDs allow attackers to brute-force valid session tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and access the web interface.
*   **Credentials Stored in Cookies:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Web interface credentials stored in base64 encoded cookies over HTTP.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Credentials sent in cookies in a reversible encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure allows attackers to steal user credentials.
*   **Remote Command Injection (CVE-2010-3037):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/goform/websXMLAdminRequestCgi.cgi` script is vulnerable to command injection.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Unsanitized user-supplied input leads to arbitrary command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Post-authentication, attackers can execute arbitrary commands as root, leading to complete compromise of the device. The "username" field is specifically mentioned as a vulnerable parameter.
*   **Weak Credential Obfuscation:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Passwords in `/opt/rv/Versions/CurrentVersion/Mcu/Config/Mcu.val` are weakly obfuscated.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Trivial password obfuscation.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** All vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **Web interface:** Multiple vulnerabilities are related to the web interface.
*   **Network services:** FTP and SSH daemons are vulnerable due to hardcoded credentials and misconfiguration.
*   **HTTP:** Credentials sent through cookies over http.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Authentication:**  Some vulnerabilities (like the command injection) require authentication, however, the weak session ID vulnerability can be used to gain initial access.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters:** For command injection, the attacker needs to identify vulnerable parameters like the "username" field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full device compromise:** Remote command injection allows for complete control of the device.
*   **Internal network access:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to pivot and attack other parts of the target network.
*   **Information disclosure:** User credentials and configuration details can be harvested.
*   **Unauthorized access:** Access to the web interface and device via various methods.

**Affected Systems:**

*   Cisco Unified Videoconferencing 3515, 3522, 3527, 5230, 3545, 5110, and 5115 Systems.
*   Unspecified Radvision systems
*   Firmware version 7.0.1.13.3 and likely all deployed versions.
