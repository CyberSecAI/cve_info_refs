=====================================================================
Description:
During an external pentest exercise for one of our clients, multiple
vulnerabilities and weaknesses were found on the Cisco CUVC-5110-HD10 which
allowed us to ultimately gain access to the internal network.
- - Hard-coded credentials - CVE-2010-3038
Three accounts have a login shell and a password the administrator can neither
disable nor change. The affected accounts are "root", "cs" and "develop".
Matta didn't spend the CPU cycles required to get those passwords but will
provide the salted hashes to interested parties. The credentials can be used
against both the FTP and the SSH daemon running on the device.
- - Services misconfiguration
There is an FTP daemon (vsftpd) running but no mention in the documentation
of what it might be useful for. User credentials created from the
web-interface allow to explore the filesystem/firmware of the device.
The file /etc/shadow has read permissions for all.
The ssh daemon (openssh) has a non-default but curious configuration. It
allows port-forwarding and socks proxies to be created, X11 to be
forwarded... even with the restricted shells.
The daemon binding the port of the web-interface is running as root.
- - Weak session IDs on the web interface
Session IDs are timestamps of when the user logged-in and are trivial to
forge. There are numerous ways of remotely gathering the remote time and
uptime, the easiest being to ask over RPC... Assuming that a user or an
administrator logged into the device shortly after it was powered up, and
that the network connectivity is fast, it is practical to bruteforce a
valid session id.
Using this vulnerability, a non-authenticated attacker can authenticate.
- - Usage of cookies to store credentials
Credentials to access the web interface are stored in base64 format in the
cookie sent by the browser. Over http in default configuration. While users
are not expected to reuse their credentials, in practice they do; this is
an information-disclosure bug.
- - Remote Command Injection on the web-interface - CVE-2010-3037
The script at /goform/websXMLAdminRequestCgi.cgi is vulnerable to remote
command injection (post authentication). Many parameters can be abused,
including but not limited to the "username" field. Obviously, as the
webserver is running as root, it can lead to complete compromise of the
device.
- - Weak obfuscation of credentials
The configuration file /opt/rv/Versions/CurrentVersion/Mcu/Config/Mcu.val
contains obfuscated passwords which are trivial to reveal. This is an
information-disclosure bug. Best practices recommend using PBKDF2 to store
passwords.
=====================================================================
Impact
If successful, a malicious third party can get full control of the device and
harvest user passwords with little to no effort. The Attacker might
reposition and launch an attack against other parts of the target
infrastructure from there.
=====================================================================
Versions affected:
Firmware version 7.0.1.13.3 tested. All deployed versions are probably
vulnerable.
=====================================================================
Threat mitigation
Until a patch is issued by the vendor, Matta recommends you unplug the
device from its network socket.

=====================================================================
Description:

During an external pentest exercise for one of our clients, multiple
 vulnerabilities and weaknesses were found on the  Cisco CUVC-5110-HD10 which
 allowed us to ultimately gain access to the internal network.

- - Hard-coded credentials - CVE-2010-3038

Three accounts have a login shell and a password the administrator can neither
 disable nor change. The affected accounts are "root", "cs" and "develop".
 Matta didn't spend the CPU cycles required to get those passwords but will
 provide the salted hashes to interested parties. The credentials can be used
 against both the FTP and the SSH daemon running on the device.

- - Services misconfiguration

There is an FTP daemon (vsftpd) running but no mention in the documentation
 of what it might be useful for. User credentials created from the
 web-interface allow to explore the filesystem/firmware of the device.

The file /etc/shadow has read permissions for all.

The ssh daemon (openssh) has a non-default but curious configuration. It
 allows port-forwarding and socks proxies to be created, X11 to be
 forwarded... even with the restricted shells.

The daemon binding the port of the web-interface is running as root.

- - Weak session IDs on the web interface

Session IDs are timestamps of when the user logged-in and are trivial to
 forge. There are numerous ways of remotely gathering the remote time and
 uptime, the easiest being to ask over RPC... Assuming that a user or an
 administrator logged into the device shortly after it was powered up, and
 that the network connectivity is fast, it is practical to bruteforce a
 valid session id.

Using this vulnerability, a non-authenticated attacker can authenticate.

- - Usage of cookies to store credentials

Credentials to access the web interface are stored in base64 format in the
 cookie sent by the browser. Over http in default configuration. While users
 are not expected to reuse their credentials, in practice they do; this is
 an information-disclosure bug.

- - Remote Command Injection on the web-interface - CVE-2010-3037

The script at /goform/websXMLAdminRequestCgi.cgi is vulnerable to remote
 command injection (post authentication). Many parameters can be abused,
 including but not limited to the "username" field. Obviously, as the
 webserver is running as root, it can lead to complete compromise of the
 device.

- - Weak obfuscation of credentials

The configuration file /opt/rv/Versions/CurrentVersion/Mcu/Config/Mcu.val
 contains obfuscated passwords which are trivial to reveal. This is an
 information-disclosure bug. Best practices recommend using PBKDF2 to store
 passwords.

=====================================================================
Impact

If successful, a malicious third party can get full control of the device and
 harvest user passwords with little to no effort. The Attacker might
 reposition and launch an attack against other parts of the target
 infrastructure from there.

=====================================================================
Versions affected:

Firmware version 7.0.1.13.3 tested. All deployed versions are probably
 vulnerable.

=====================================================================
Threat mitigation

Until a patch is issued by the vendor, Matta recommends you unplug the
 device from its network socket.
