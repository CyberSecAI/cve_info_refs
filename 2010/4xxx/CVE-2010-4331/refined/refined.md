{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application renders unfiltered and unencrypted content from two different cookies.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the cookies, which are then executed when a user views pages that render these cookies. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through manipulation of the 'default_news' and 'sponsors' cookies.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to modify the cookies, either through their own browser if targeting themselves or possibly through other vulnerabilities if targeting other users."
