{
  "CVE-2010-4052": {
    "Description": "The GNU C library's regcomp() function is vulnerable to stack exhaustion due to excessive recursion when handling complex regular expressions with nested quantifiers. This can lead to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "The `regcomp()` function in the GNU C library uses recursion to process regular expressions with nested quantifiers. This recursive approach can lead to stack exhaustion when processing overly complex expressions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack exhaustion due to excessive recursion",
      "Insufficient checks on the complexity of the input regular expression"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service by crashing applications that use the vulnerable `regcomp()` function.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted regular expressions passed to applications that use the vulnerable function",
      "Via command-line arguments to utilities using the regex engine (like grep, pgrep, whatis etc)"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to supply a specially crafted regular expression to a vulnerable application."
  }
