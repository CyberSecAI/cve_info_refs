# 0040832C  |. F3:AB          REP STOS DWORD PTR ES:[EDI]   -> fill ecx dwords at edi with eax
#
# So basically memset(edi,eax,ecx). We control ecx, so we have control over the number of dwords
# it writes in the heap buffer. But, as you can see, the dwords themselves are not controllable,
# they are NULL. However, we can still write past the bounds of the allocated chunk of memory.
#
# Although it seems unlikely code execution could result, it is still possible to write data
# past the memory allocated on a heap (0x350000) available in the server process.
#
# This code works by setting up a fake channel and accepting a connection. To trigger this
# vulnerability, the server simply needs to initiate communication (monitor mode would be ideal)
# with this fake channel and the results depend on the response you choose.
#
# I tested version 3 running on Windows. Testing the server with this code and its default
# response should't cause the server to crash (immediately anyways). Larger lengths (such as
# the one commented out) may cause the server to crash.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Automated Solutions Modbus/TCP Master OPC server Modbus TCP header vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#768840

Original Release Date: 2011-02-03 | Last Revised: 2011-02-03

---

### Overview

Automated Solutions OPC Server contains a heap corruption vulnerability in the Modbus/TCP Master OPC server.

### Description

| Automated Solutions Modbus/TCP Master OPC Server contains a heap corruption vulnerability. The server is vulnerable to an attacker writing an arbitrary number of double words or DWORDs onto the heap.  For additional information see [ICSA-10-322-02A](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-322-02A.pdf).Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Successful exploitation would likely not allow arbitrary code execution; however, an exploit could possibly corrupt the OPC server memory and cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**According to the Modbus/TCP OPC Server [readme](http://automatedsolutions.com/pub/asmbtcpopc/readme.htm) file, version 3.0.2 addresses this vulnerability. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Enable firewall rules to restrict access to only trusted sources. |

1. Added device property for setting transaction block size.

2. Rebuilt using latest OPC DA source files.

3. Updated Licensing mechanism to v4.2.1.7.

11/18/2003

v2.6b

1. Fixed problem with clicking the Close [X] button while running in the
system tray and with at least one client connected.

When running in the system tray, clicking the close button should cause the
server window to close for viewing but remain in the system tray. If a client
was connected and the close button pressed, the server would erroneously warn
that clients were connected and ask whether to continue with shutdown.

2. Added license transfer button to demo dialog to allow license transfer to
expired demo machine.

10/7/02

v2.6a

1. Fixed obscure problem with license file corruption.

Previously, certain conditions made it possible to exit the app without closing
the license file, which in some instances resulted in corruption.

2. Fixed problem with ASBVSimpleClient example
application.

Result code for OPCGroup functions was tested for = 0
to indicate success, causing successful operations to report an error.

Result code now tested for >= 0.
