Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a heap corruption issue in the Automated Solutions Modbus/TCP Master OPC server.
- A specially crafted length field within a Modbus/TCP packet header can trigger the heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Corruption:** The server copies a specified length of data, controlled by the attacker through a manipulated Modbus packet header, into a heap buffer using a `memset` like operation. The size of the copy operation is determined by the length field, but the data being copied is a series of null bytes. If the length field is set to a value larger than the allocated heap buffer, an out-of-bounds write occurs.
- **Uncontrolled Data Size:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the length field, which determines the number of dwords written on the heap, is controlled by an external source (the Modbus packet).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although the exploit does not directly allow for code execution, writing beyond the allocated memory on the heap can cause memory corruption which can lead to a denial of service by crashing the OPC server.
- **Memory Corruption:** The heap corruption can lead to unpredictable behavior and other potential issues within the OPC server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via Modbus/TCP.
- **Specifically crafted Modbus/TCP packets:** The attacker needs to send malicious Modbus/TCP packets with a crafted length field in the header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send Modbus/TCP packets to the vulnerable server, meaning network connectivity to the server's port (typically 502).
- **Modbus Protocol Knowledge:** Basic understanding of the Modbus/TCP protocol is required to craft the malicious packets with an invalid length field.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided exploit code from Exploit-DB demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability. It involves creating a server to accept a connection and then sends back a crafted response with an invalid length field to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vendor released version 3.0.2 to address this vulnerability by fixing the heap corruption problem.
- The vulnerability is present in Automated Solutions Modbus/TCP Master OPC Server.
