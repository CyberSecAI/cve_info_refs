Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the comment section of the Skeletonz CMS. Specifically, the "Name" and "Comment" fields do not filter or encode user-supplied data, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a persistent XSS, meaning the injected script is stored on the server (in this case, within the CMS comments) and executed each time a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the comment fields.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected script could steal cookies or other session data, allowing an attacker to impersonate other users.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify the content or functionality of the web page.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious sites or trigger downloads of malicious files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Comment Submission:** The attack vector is through the comment submission form of the CMS.
- **Input Fields:** The vulnerable input fields are the "Name" and "Comment" fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the malicious script in the comment section.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, by submitting malicious input to the web form.
- **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs only a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript to craft the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit involves injecting `<script>alert('xss');</script>` into the "Name" and "Comment" fields.
- The vulnerability was tested on Windows XP and version 1.0 of the Skeletonz CMS.
- The exploit was found in the comment section of the CMS.
