  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application includes a file based on user-controlled input. Specifically, the 'TMPL[path]' parameter in the URL is used to construct a path to a file which is then included using 'include_once'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a URL with the 'TMPL[path]' parameter pointing to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs a server under their control to host the malicious file."
