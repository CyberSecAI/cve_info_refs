Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-4072, extracted from the provided content:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `copy_shmid_to_user` function in `ipc/shm.c` within the Linux kernel does not properly initialize a `shmid_ds` structure before copying it back to user space. This structure contains uninitialized stack memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Memory:** The primary weakness is the use of uninitialized stack memory within the `shmid_ds` structure. This leads to information disclosure.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** The function fails to sanitize or zero out the stack-based structure before copying it to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** Local users can read potentially sensitive information from the kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. The severity is low according to bugzilla entries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users on the system.
*   **shmctl system call:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `shmctl` system call.
*   **"old shm interface":** The specific vulnerability is linked to the "old shm interface" implying that it may not affect newer implementations of shared memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system.
*   **Ability to call shmctl:** The attacker must be able to call the vulnerable `shmctl` system call.

**Additional Technical Details & Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernels version >= 2.6.0 and >= 2.4.0
*   Fixes for this vulnerability have been made available in various distros.
*   Some sources mention this vulnerability is related to other similar stack memory disclosure issues (e.g. ipc/sem.c leak).
*  Some sources indicate this is related to the "System V shared memory subsystem"
*  Some sources mention this is in relation to the `compat_sys_shmctl` function in `ipc/compat.c`.
