## [bug-patch] Directory traversal vulnerability in patch (or dpkg-source)

Hi Andreas,

a fellow Debian developer has concerns that patch allows ".." in path
names which would allow an attacker to create arbitrary files using a
patch file.

In my view, there is no reason to allow that by default, and patch
should remove all ".." components in the input, and probably also a
leading "/". (Maybe a switch -P, --absolute-names like tar has should
then restore the current behavior.)

What do you think? Debian would probably issue a security advisory
with an updated patch version. We could do the changes ourselves, but
would of course prefer an upstream implementation.

(Jakub: I'll probably be unavailable for a few days - feel free to NMU
and/or coordinate with the release team.)

Christoph

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

There are certainly valid use cases with ".." in a *source* file name, but that is fine: those are not rejected.  It's only when ".." appears as a component of a destination file name that there is a security problem.   Bob, I found a copy of the mutex_int.h patch you mentioned above:     <http://git.shr-project.org/git/?p=n900-oe.git;a=blob;f=recipes/db/files/db5-arm-thumb-mutex.patch;h=51b88823cf8ec1d959e1c73adb83abc4be4ae395;hb=9cd6a9dcdb323334186f0fe7c4537cd9dc8a58b1>  It starts like this:     1 Index: db-5.0.21/../dbinc/mutex_int.h    2 ===================================================================    3 --- db-5.0.21.orig/../dbinc/mutex_int.h 2010-03-30 10:36:09.000000000 -0700    4 +++ db-5.0.21/../dbinc/mutex_int.h      2010-05-22 12:07:38.281286337 -0700  That is a fine example of a useless ".." in a destination file name component. That patch will work just as well if you transform it to look like this:     1 Index: dbinc/mutex_int.h    2 ===================================================================    3 --- dbinc/mutex_int.h 2010-03-30 10:36:09.000000000 -0700    4 +++ dbinc/mutex_int.h      2010-05-22 12:07:38.281286337 -0700  Please understand that patch cannot (or at least will not) read options from a configuration file, and I would be strongly opposed to letting an environment variable control security sensitive behavior like this.  The above file is doubtless version-controlled somewhere. I suggest you update it accordingly, along with any others that fit the pattern. Even if patch were to add a --force (-like) option to make it accept such names, the code that applies patches would have to be modified to invoke patch with that new option.  If you find a case in which the ".." component is somehow required, please report it here or on the upstream bug-patch mailing list.  Thanks,  Jim   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c31)  Jacob Oursland    2011-08-07 08:41:23 UTC  ``` Fixing this "bug" has caused problems in environments where patch is being used to add and remove text from text files.  Buildroot uses this methood to add functionality a target filesystem based upon selected components.  For example, you may wish to manipulate a config file in ../target/etc/ to use one DHCP client instead of another.  This "fix" ignores the real problem, but creates a headache for others.  The bug isn't that patch can create files or manipulate text files, as that is its purpose, but rather that patch is being used on untrusted patch files.  If a patch file can be successfully used to create a file, it can also be used to install a backdoor in source that the user is expecting to be manipulated.  It should be up to the user to not apply arbitrary patches, just as it is up to the user to not copy and paste arbitrary shell code into a terminal.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c32)  Tim Waugh    2011-08-07 17:30:25 UTC  ``` The issue is that patch can modify/create files *outside* the current working directory without the invoking user's knowledge or consent.  If you really want to do this, simply specify that file on the patch command line.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c33)  Jacob Oursland    2011-08-07 18:58:46 UTC  ``` I am well aware that this behavior can modify files outside of the working directory; in fact, that is the intended behavior.  The file I wish to modify is in a subdirectory of the parent directory to the current working directory, such as "../target/file".  Furthermore, if the user is unaware of this behavior, it is because they are not looking at the patch file.  Consent to this behavior is implied by the user running patch on the patch file.  It should be up to the user to verify that the patch file is valid and its modifications intended before applying.  The example case that was used in the initial report was that of a malicious patch file in unverified and/or untrustworthy source.  While the patch concern is being addressed, it ignores the fact that the source itself is untrustworthy.  Ignoring the patch concerns, there is no guarantee that the resulting binary is not malicious in nature.  Removing ".." from file names is a bad fix.  The real fix is "don't run code from untrustworthy or unverified sources!"   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c34)  Jim Meyering    2011-08-07 19:38:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #33](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c33)) > I am well aware that this behavior can modify files outside of the working > directory; in fact, that is the intended behavior.

It would be too risky/surprising -- like telling people always to verify that a tarball "looks ok" before unpacking it.   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c35)  Andreas Gruenbacher    2011-08-08 08:12:01 UTC  ``` I'm on the side of Jim and Tim on this issue; Jacob's use case doesn't seem very convincing.  Disallowing ".." in pathname components is a step towards the least surprise: it confines the area in which a patch can cause damage.  As the example of tar shows, patch isn't alone in taking this approach.   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c36)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-10 20:44:09 UTC  ``` I agree as well.  However, maybe it makes sense to add an --unsafe option to patch so that it _can_ do what it used to?  That would keep the default to what we've got here now (rejecting these relative paths), but allowing people in esoteric environments or with certain use cases, to continue using patch in a way they expect.  Just a thought.  I certainly agree that reverting these changes is not an option, but perhaps having an ungainly commandline option like --unsafe might be useful as well.   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c37)  Jim Meyering    2011-08-11 11:09:45 UTC  ``` I would not reject an upstream patch that adds that -- it'd have to update documentation and NEWS, and add a test case or two.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=667529#c38)  Vincent Danen    2015-08-22 03:26:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact.

Message-ID: <20110105215457.GL15891@redhat.com>
Date: Wed, 5 Jan 2011 14:54:57 -0700
From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: patch directory traversal flaw

We got a heads up on a directory traversal flaw in patch.  I don't think
a CVE name has been assigned to it; could we get one?  It allows for the
creation of arbitrary files in unexpected places due to the use of '..'.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Talking to Steve it looks like some things are not very clear, so I hope the
following explains it:

* dpkg uses patch to apply patches in source packages format 1.0 and 3.0
quilt (in spite of the name, dpkg uses an internal implementation of quilt)
* under the hood, patch is the one traversing directories when applying
patches
* dpkg has its own set of checks for such traversals and general patch
sanity checks. In fact, CVE-2010-0396 was also related to directory
traversals.

CVE-2010-1679 is about dpkg being happy to pass patches with invalid paths
to patch and following symlinks in the .pc directory.

That said, I don't know if quilt itself is affected by the .pc directory
issue, and if it is, whether it is really relevant.

For further reference, DSA-2142-1 addresses the flaws in dpkg:
