How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\*\* This privacy policy is currently being adopted and may not yet be fully implemented at all websites \*\*

This Privacy Policy clarifies the nature, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data
(hereinafter referred to as âDataâ) within our online offering and the related websites, features
and content, as well as external online presence, e.g. our social media profiles on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites
(collectively referred to as âonline presenceâ).
With regard to the terminology we use, e.g. âProcessingâ or âResponsibleâ,
we refer to the definitions in Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. Name and contact details of the controller and the company data protection officer

This privacy policy applies to data processing by:

Responsible:

The Apache Software Foundation

V. P. Data Privacy

1000 N West Street, Suite 1200

Wilmington, DE 19801

U.S.A.

E-Mail: vp-privacy@apache.org

## 2. Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use

### a) When visiting the website

#### Log files

When you visit our websites ([full list of domains](/policies/asf-domains.html)) or one of our subdomains,
the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.
This information is temporarily stored in a log file.
The following information is being collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

* The IP address of the requesting computer
* The date and time of access
* The name and URL of the retrieved file
* The website from which access is made (referrer URL)
* Geo information of the location from which access is made
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider

The data mentioned are processed by us for the following purposes:

* Ensuring connectivity of our website
* Ensuring a use of our website, of which we think is comfortable for you
* Evaluation of system security and stability
* Other administrative purposes

The retention time for this data is 90 days.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website.
Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.

#### Matomo

In addition to log files, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently accessed,
where users get lost in the documentation, etc.
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website,
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

* The IP address from which you access the website
* The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site
* The date and time you access our site
* The pages you visit
* If you click on any of the file download links on our website
* The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site
* The addresses of pages you go to from our site
* The search terms you use on the website

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software Matomo. We donât
use any cookies to collect this information. An IP address is anonymized by removing
the last two octets from the IP address. That means that if your IP is 192.168.100.50,
we store it as 192.168.0.0.

Matomo is self-hosted on a virtual machine provided by the Apache Software Foundation.
It can only be accessed by members of the Apache Privacy committee. The data can be
viewed by anyone by visiting https://analytics.apache.org/.

Matomo respects any Do Not Track setting in your browser. You can also opt-out
from all Matomo tracking below.

### b) When registering for our newsletter and mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented,
we use your e-mail address to periodically send you our newsletter.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

We inform our visitors at regular intervals through newsletters about news and offers from The Apache Software Foundation.

The newsletter of our Foundation can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person before the first time of sending the newsletter, using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address is the person who authorized the receipt of the newsletter.

When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter is used exclusively to send our newsletter.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter/mailing list or technical changes.

There will be no transfer to third parties of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service.

Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
Consent to the storage of personal data that the person has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of each newsletter email.

### c) When registering for our mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, we use your e-mail address to send you messages arriving at our mailing lists.
For the receipt of the mailing list message the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

Visitors may communicate with us through our mailing lists.

The mailing list messages of our organisation can only be received if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the mailing list.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address authorized the receipt of the mailing list messages.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.
When a mailing list is archived, the log file will be deleted.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for a mailing list will be used exclusively to send messages arriving at that mailing list.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the mailing list service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the mailing list or other technical changes.

We will not actively transfer to third parties any personal data as part of the mailing list service.
However, almost all of our mailing lists are of a public nature.

This means, your name and email may be exposed to the public.
Also, all information you send to a mailing list will be exposed to the public.
Third parties may collect this information and process it separately.
The sender of messages is responsible if they expose their personal data to the public.

All content sent to mailing lists is archived indefinitely.
By using our mailing list service, you agree that any content is archived in that way.

Subscription to our mailing lists may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data that a person has given us for the mailing list dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of every email.

## 3. Disclosure of data

Transfer of your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below does not take place.
We only share your personal information with third parties if:

* You, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR, have given express consent to this.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR is required to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have a predominantly legitimate interest in not disclosing your data.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR is a legal obligation.
* As permitted by law and according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, disclosure is required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you.

## 4. External service providers

The Apache Software Foundation uses the following external service providers who help to optimize its services.
Insofar as these service providers process data on behalf of The Apache Software Foundation, agreements have been concluded with them which set the European data protection standards as binding and, in particular, prohibit the use of the data for other purposes.
If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called âcontract processing contractâ, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.

### (a) Hetzner: Hosting

The servers are located in the USA and used for hosting databases and web content.
Microsoft fully supports the GDPR. Details and privacy statements can be found [here](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=67).

### (e) GitHub: Source Code Hosting

The Apache Software Foundation uses the GitHub Services (GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, California 94107 USA) to store, serve, and maintain source code.
GitHub fully supports the GDPR.

how our software is downloaded, adopted and used. Scarf fully supports the GDPR.
Details and privacy statements can be found [here](https://about.scarf.sh/privacy-policy).

### (h) DinoSource ApS: PonyMail

### (i) Kapa.AI

Some project websites are using Kapa.AI to provide an advanced interface to their documentation.
Kapa.AI is a service provided by kapa.ai Inc., 1111B S Governors Ave #6248 Dover, DE 19904, US.
Kapa.AI services will be provided as âopt-inâ. While Kapa.AIs datacenters are located in the US,
the service supports the GDPR which is also reflected in the DPA.
Read more about the privacy policy of Kapa.AI at [their website](https://www.kapa.ai/content/privacy-policy).

## 5. Social Media Plug-ins

We rely on our website on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make our company better known.
The underlying commercial purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR.
Responsibility for operation compliant with data protection is to be guaranteed by the respective providers.
The integration of these plug-ins by us is done by means of the so-called two-click method to protect visitors to our website in the best possible way.

### a) YouTube

On our website we have integrated components from YouTube.
YouTube is an internet video portal that allows video publishers to freely watch video clips provided by other users for free viewing, rating and commenting.
YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, so that both complete film and television broadcasts, music videos, trailers and user-made videos uploaded via the YouTube internet portal are available.

YouTubeâs operating company is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Each visit to one of the pages of this site operated by the controller and incorporating a YouTube component (YouTube video) will automatically cause the Internet browser on the subjectâs information technology system to download an illustration of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube.
More information about YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/.
As part of this technical process, YouTube and Google are aware of the specific location of our site visited by the person concerned.
If the person visiting our site is logged in to YouTube at the same time, YouTube calls a sub-page containing a YouTube video for the person visiting our site.
This information is collected by YouTube and Google and associated with the individual YouTube account.

YouTube and Google will always receive information through the YouTube component that a person has visited our website if the person is logged into YouTube at the time of access to our website; this happens regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not.
If such transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not wanted by the person visiting our site, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their YouTube account before visiting our website.

YouTubeâs privacy policy, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, identifies the collection, processing, and use of personally identifiable information by YouTube and Google.

## 7. Affected rights

You have the right:

* in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR, to request information about your personal data processed by us. In particular, you can request information on the processing purposes, the category of personal data, the categories of recipients to whom your data has been disclosed, the planned retention period, the right to rectification, deletion, limitation of processing or opposition, the existence of a right to complain, the source of your data, if not collected from us, and the existence of automated decision-making including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information about your data.

* to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data according to Art. 18 GDPR, as far as the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, but you reject its deletion and we no longer need the data, but you assert this, in the exercise or defense of legal claims or you have objected to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR.
* in accordance with Art. 20 GDPR, to receive your personal data provided to us in a structured, standard and machine-readable format or to request transmission to another person.

## 8. Right to object

If our retention of your personal data is based on legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, you have the right to file an objection against the processing of your personal data in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR, provided that there are reasons for this arising from your particular situation or the objection is directed against direct mail.
In the latter case, you have a general right of objection, which is implemented by us without specifying any particular situation.
If you would like to exercise your right of revocation or objection, please send an e-mail to vp-privacy@apache.org.

## 9. Data security

We use the popular SSL (Secure Socket Layer) method during your site visit, in conjunction with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser.
In general, this is a 256-bit encryption.
If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead.
Whether a single page of our website is encrypted is shown by the closed representation of the key or lock icon in the lower status bar of your browser.

We also take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties.
Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.

## 10. Updating and changing this privacy policy

This privacy policy is currently valid and is valid as of 2025-01-16.

As a result of the further development of our website and offers thereof, or due to changed legal or official requirements, it may be necessary to change this privacy policy.

## Synopsis

Important: mingw32-libxml2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0217)

## Topic

Updated mingw32-libxml2 packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This advisory also contains
information about future updates for the mingw32 packages, as well as the
deprecation of the packages with the release of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages provide the libxml2 library, a development toolbox providing
the implementation of various XML standards, for users of MinGW (Minimalist
GNU for Windows).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mingw32 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will no
longer be updated proactively and will be deprecated with the release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4. These packages were provided to support other
capabilities in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and were not intended for direct
customer use. Customers are advised to not use these packages with
immediate effect. Future updates to these packages will be at Red Hat's
discretion and these packages may be removed in a future minor release.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
entity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked
against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2011-3919)

A heap-based buffer underflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
certain entities. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-5134)

It was found that the hashing routine used by libxml2 arrays was
susceptible to predictable hash collisions. Sending a specially-crafted
message to an XML service could result in longer processing time, which
could lead to a denial of service. To mitigate this issue, randomization
has been added to the hashing function to reduce the chance of an attacker
successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2012-0841)

Multiple flaws were found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath (XML Path
Language) expressions. If an attacker were able to supply a
specially-crafted XML file to an application using libxml2, as well as an
XPath expression for that application to run against the crafted file, it
could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-4008, CVE-2010-4494,
CVE-2011-2821, CVE-2011-2834)

Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libxml2 decoded
certain XML files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-0216,
CVE-2011-3102)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions. If an attacker
were able to supply a specially-crafted XML file to an application using
libxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that application to run against
the crafted file, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-1944)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an
application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2011-3905)

Red Hat would like to thank the Google Security Team for reporting the
CVE-2010-4008 issue. Upstream acknowledges Bui Quang Minh from Bkis as the
original reporter of CVE-2010-4008.

All users of mingw32-libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=709747#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-01 14:46:56 UTC  ``` An integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libxml, XML files manipulation library, processed certain XPath expressions. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened in an application linked against libxml would cause that application to crash, or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

We would like to offer special thanks -- and a number of rewards -- to Aki Helin of OUSPG for his extensive help with the new PDF feature. We’d also like to extend thanks to Sergey Glazunov and Marc Schoenefeld for finding bugs during the development cycle such that they never reached a stable build.

Full details about the changes are available in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=62249:58656&mode=html). If you find new issues, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry). Want to change to another Chrome release channel?

allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0530).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- clamav
Specially crafted VBA data in Microsoft Office documents could crash
clamav or potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code. clamav
was updated to version 0.97 to fix the issue (CVE-2011-1003).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- aaa\_base
shell meta characters in file names could cause interactive shells
to execute arbitrary commands when performing tab expansion
(CVE-2011-0468).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4
- flash-player
The Adobe Flash Player was updated to version 10.2.153.1 to fix a
buffer overflow. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0609).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- pango
Specially crafted font files could cause a heap corruption in
applications linked against pango (CVE-2011-0064, CVE-2011-0020).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- openssl
A malformed ClientHello message could crash servers using openssl for
communication (CVE-2011-0014).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- subversion
Remote attackers could crash an svn server by causing a NULL deref
(CVE-2011-0715).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.4
- postgresql
A buffer overflow in the intarray module potentially allowed
attackers to execute arbitrary code as the user running postgresql
(CVE-2010-4015).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- logwatch

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
