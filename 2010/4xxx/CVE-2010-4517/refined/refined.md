```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Input passed to the "char" parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary SQL code can be injected, allowing manipulation of the database.
- Attack vectors: By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious "char" parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The magic_quotes_gpc setting needs to be Off.
