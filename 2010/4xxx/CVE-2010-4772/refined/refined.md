Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4772:

**CVE Description:**  The provided text does not include the official CVE description, however, based on the exploit-db entry, the vulnerability exists in S\_CMS 2.5.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the improper handling of the `search_app` variable within the `search.php` file. This lack of sanitization allows for multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The application reveals the server's root path due to the lack of input validation of the 'id' parameter in `viewforum.php`.
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The `search_app` variable is vulnerable to SQL injection, which can be exploited through the 'id' parameter in `viewforum.php`.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `search_app` variable is also vulnerable to XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts through the 'id' parameter in `viewforum.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Path Disclosure:**  An attacker can discover the server's file system structure.
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive database information, including user credentials (username and password).
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web application. If successful, the injected scripts could redirect users to malicious sites, steal cookies, or perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `viewforum.php` file, manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No special privileges or access are required other than network connectivity.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
