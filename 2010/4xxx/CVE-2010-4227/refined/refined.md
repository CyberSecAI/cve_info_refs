  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The xdrDecodeString function in XNFS.NLM uses a user-supplied length value to null-terminate a string, and this length value can be signed, leading to a potential write of a null byte at an arbitrary address.",

      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)"

      "Sending a crafted NFS RPC request to UDP port 1234.",
      "A crafted, signed value in a NFS RPC request"
