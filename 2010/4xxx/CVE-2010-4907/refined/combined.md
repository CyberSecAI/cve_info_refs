How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [Web Security problems in Zenphoto version 1.3](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/zenphoto-13-advisory/)

![](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/22141821/image5.jpg)

**Note** — This post applies to an older version of Acunetix

[![](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/zen-photo-logo.png "zen photo logo")](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/zen-photo-logo.png)

We are continuing with the list of security vulnerabilities found in a number of web applications while testing our latest version of [Acunetix WVS v7](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/releases/acunetix-7-web-security-easier-cost-effective/) . In this blog post, we will look into the details of a number of security problems discovered by Acunetix WVS in the popular web gallery application Zenphoto;

> Zenphoto is a standalone gallery CMS that just makes sense and doesn’t try to do everything and your dishes. We hope you agree with our philosophy: simpler is better. Don’t get us wrong though – Zenphoto really does have everything you need for web media gallery management.

**The following web vulnerabilities were found in Zenphoto Version 1.3;**

1. SQL injection in **“/zenphoto\_1\_3/zp-core/full-image.php”**, parameter **“a”**.
2. Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in **“/zenphoto\_1\_3/zp-core/admin.php”**, parameter **“from”**.
3. Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in **“/zenphoto\_1\_3/zp-core/admin.php”**, parameter **“user”**.

**Technical details about each web vulnerability are below:**

**1.** SQL injection in **“/zenphoto\_1\_3/zp-core/full-image.php”**, parameter **“a”**.

Source file: **/var/www/zenphoto\_1\_3/zp-core/functions-db.php** line: **65**

***Additional details:***

***SQL query:***

```
SELECT `id`, `album_theme` FROM `zp_albums` WHERE `folder` LIKE "1ACUSTART'"*" OR `folder` LIKE "1ACUSTART'"*/
 	ACUEND"
```

“mysql\_query” was called.

***Stack trace:***

```
1. query([string] "SELECT `id`, `album_theme` FROM `zp_albums` WHERE `folder` LIKE "1ACUSTART'"*" OR `folder` LIKE "1ACUSTART'"*/n 	ACUEND"", [boolean] false)
  2. query_full_array([string] "SELECT `id`, `album_theme` FROM `zp_albums` WHERE `folder` LIKE "1ACUSTART'"*" OR `folder` LIKE "1ACUSTART'"*/n 	ACUEND"")
  3. getAlbumInherited([string] "1ACUSTART'"*/n 	ACUEND", [string] "album_theme", [NULL] )
  4. themeSetup([string] "1ACUSTART'"*/n 	ACUEND")
```

As you can see in the SQL query (or the stack trace), in order to alter the SQL statement sent to the database you need to use a double qoute (not a single one, as in most SQL injections).

***Sample HTTP Request:***

```
GET /zenphoto_1_3/zp-core/full-image.php?a=%24%7binjecthere%7d&i=system-bug.jpg&q=75 HTTP/1.1

**2.** Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in **“/zenphoto\_1\_3/zp-core/admin.php”**, parameter **“from”**.

The input is reflected inside a tag element between double quotes.
