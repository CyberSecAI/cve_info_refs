Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in Zenphoto version 1.3, as detailed in the Acunetix blog post:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized input in the `a` parameter of `/zenphoto_1_3/zp-core/full-image.php` is used in an SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the injection requires a double quote instead of a single quote.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `a` GET parameter in the `full-image.php` file.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and inject SQL syntax into the vulnerable parameter.

2.  **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized input in the `from` parameter of `/zenphoto_1_3/zp-core/admin.php` is reflected in the HTML output.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-controlled input before including it in the HTML output, making it vulnerable to XSS. The input is reflected within a tag element between double quotes.
    *  **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the web page, which could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `from` GET parameter in the `admin.php` file.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request with malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameter.

3. **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized input in the `user` parameter of `/zenphoto_1_3/zp-core/admin.php` is reflected in the HTML output.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-controlled input before including it in the HTML output, making it vulnerable to XSS. The input is reflected within a tag element between double quotes.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the web page, which could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `user` POST parameter in the `admin.php` file.
     *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request with malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered using Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported to the Zenphoto team on 22/7/2010, and they were fixed in a later version of Zenphoto.
*   The provided content contains more detailed information compared to a basic CVE description, including the vulnerable files, parameters, and sample HTTP requests. It also highlights the specific SQL syntax needed for the SQL Injection (use of double quotes) which might not be immediately obvious from a basic description.
