  "CVE-2010-4262": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Xfig processed certain FIG images.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could create a FIG image with a specially-crafted color definition, and trick the local, unsuspecting user into opening it, which could lead to xfig executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the executable.",
      "Attack vectors": "By enticing a user to open a specially crafted FIG image file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious FIG file and convince a user to open it."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "xfig has a buffer overflow, when opening .fig files with malicious colour definitions.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow when parsing color definitions in FIG files.",
       "Impact of exploitation":"It will cause crashes and potential execution of arbitrary code.",
      "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted .fig file.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Attacker needs to craft a malicious .fig file and have the user open it."
