Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-4955

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `board.php` script of APBoard version 2.1.0 and earlier. The `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize user input provided via the `id` parameter in `board.php`, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially manipulate database queries to read, modify, or delete data.
- They can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information within the database.
- They can potentially escalate privileges or perform other malicious activities on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `board.php` script, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
- A vulnerable URL would look like `http://www.yoursite.de/board/board.php?id=X[SQL INJECTION]`, where `X[SQL INJECTION]` represents the malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server.
- They need to know the specific URL and parameter vulnerable to SQL injection, which in this case is `board.php?id=`.
- They require knowledge of SQL and how to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- No special privileges or prior authentication are required, as the vulnerability exists in publicly accessible parts of the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit example provided shows how to inject SQL code into the `id` parameter using a `UNION` statement to potentially retrieve data from the `USERS` table.
- The dork "APBoard 2.1.0 Â© 2003-2010 APP - Another PHP Program" helps to identify potentially vulnerable systems.
