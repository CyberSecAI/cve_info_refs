### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# Pithos does not start (due to permission error)

Bug #667896 reported by
[josefnpat](https://launchpad.net/~josefnpat)
on 2010-10-28

[258](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Pithos](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pithos) | Fix Released | High | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

VERSION:

Newest ppa Pithos with ubuntu 10.4 64bit.

PROBLEM:

When permissions on pre-existing /tmp/pithos.debug.log do not belong to current user, pithos will not start. Using an strace, I found:

IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/tmp/pithos.debug.log'

WORKAROUND:

When one either deletes /tmp/pithos.debug.log, or chown's it to the current user, it fixes the problem.

HOW TO REPRODUCE:

It can be done one of two ways. Either change the owner of the /tmp/pithos.debug.log file, and start pithos, or mode from a user standpoint:

1) Start a second ubuntu account

2) Run pithos (init /tmp/pithos.debug.log with different permissions)

3) Change accounts

4) Attempt to run pithos.

SUGGESTIONS ON FIXING:

Make each debug.log unique to each user of pithos. Just attempting to clean up the data on Pithos closing is inadequate due to the fact that pithos can be killall'd.

Hope this helps, big respect to Pithos software. Finally got me listening to Pandora again!

Btw, having predictable filenames in /tmp/ can be \*really\* bad.

Attack vector: Mallory links /tmp/pithos.debug.log to ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg. If Pithos doesn't do a lot of checking, it'll overwrite your secret key on start.

I'd use tempfile.mkstemp(prefix="pithos-debug-", suffix=".log"), or store logs in a subdirectory of ~.

I'm just going to ditch the debug log mechanism by default. It's not even useful for reporting bugs because it contains your Pandora password, so it can't be posted publicly. Yes, that's another security issue with that file on a multi-user system.

Ideally, Pithos should store debug data in memory, and if Pandora sends a weird error, it could (with the user's permission) remove private info from the log and post it to launchpad or my server.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
