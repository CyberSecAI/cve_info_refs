Package: hypermail
Version: 2.2.0.dfsg-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hypermail has a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the way it
indexes mails.
Eg: send a mail with this From address:
"<iframe src=//debian.org>" email@debian.org
All the pages indexing this email will have the iframe interprated as
html, the message listing under a specific message is also affected.

This was discovered by Eduardo Abril who sent <b>pepelotas</b> here:

Hi!

* Kevin Fernandez <kevin@findhost.org> [101001 18:17]:
> Package: hypermail
> Version: 2.2.0.dfsg-2
> Severity: grave
> Tags: security
> Justification: user security hole

Given that:
* The package hasn't actually a high popcon rating
* It has a security related bug open for over a month
* A new upstream version is available since nearly a year
* The package has been last uploaded Over two years ago
* It has some other bugs (where it seems that the current maintainer has
  only reacted to one)
* Upsteam seems to be not active any more (Homepage seems to be down)

Maybe it's time to remove this package?

Best Regards,
  Alexander
