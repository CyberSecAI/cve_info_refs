- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how Hypermail indexes emails. Specifically, it fails to properly sanitize or encode the "From" address in emails when generating index pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Hypermail interprets HTML tags present in the "From" field of an email, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the generated hypermail index pages. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement of the hypermail archive, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to send an email with a crafted "From" address containing malicious HTML. When hypermail indexes the email, the malicious HTML is rendered in the index, affecting all users who visit the index pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send emails that are processed by hypermail. The attacker needs to craft an email with a malicious "From" field that injects HTML/Javascript.
