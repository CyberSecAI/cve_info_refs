- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of the `id` parameter in `chart.php` before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code which can lead to data exfiltration, modification or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `chart.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. `magic_quotes_gpc` must be disabled on the server.
