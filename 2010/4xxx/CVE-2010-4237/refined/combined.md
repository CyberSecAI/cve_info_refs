| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-08 14:51:24 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way Mercurial handled subject Common Name field of the provided certificate (the check if the commonName in the received certificate matches the  requested hostname was not performed). An attacker, able to get a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse Mercurial into accepting it by mistake.  References: [1] <http://mercurial.selenic.com/bts/issue2407> [2] <http://bugs.python.org/issue1589> [3] <http://svn.python.org/view?view=rev&revision=85321>  Upstream changeset: [4] <http://selenic.com/repo/hg-stable/diff/f2937d6492c5/mercurial/url.py>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-08 14:54:52 UTC  ``` The true reason for this deficiency is the Python SSL module implementation, but as stated in: [5] <http://bugs.python.org/issue1589#msg58472>  "Unfortunately, hostname matching is one of those ideas that seemed better when it was thought up than it actually proved to be in practice.  I've had extensive experience with this, and have found it to almost always an application-specific decision.  I thought about this when designing the client-side verification, and couldn't see any automatic solution that doesn't get in the way.  So the right way to do this with Python is to write some application code that looks at the verified identity and makes decisions based on whatever authentication algorithm you need."   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-08 14:55:51 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the mercurial package, as shipped with Fedora release of 12 and 13 (relevant packages are already updated).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c4)  Neal Becker    2010-10-08 14:58:21 UTC  ``` So should this be closed?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c5)  Mads Kiilerich    2010-10-08 15:01:34 UTC  ``` This is fixed with 1.6.4, so it should be closed when that package hits "updates".   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-08 15:10:19 UTC  ``` Hi Neal, Mads,    the Security Response product bugs cover the same issue, present in particular package among various releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux  and Fedora.    Though this issue has been already addressed in versions of mercurial, as shipped within Fedora releases, it still applies to version of mercurial, as scheduled to appear in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.    So this bug being still valid.  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-08 15:12:28 UTC  ``` CVE Request: [6] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/10/08/2>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2010-11-16 06:56:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the version of the mercurial package, as shipped with  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having moderate security impact, a future update may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=641373#c9)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-11 21:04:18 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2010-4237>   ``` |  |

Dear Mercurial maintainers,
this is still unfixed in Squeeze, so this will likely need a
targeted fix for testing or the 1.6.4 version needs a freeze
exception. Please get in touch with the release team.

Cheers,
        Moritz

We've contacted the release team and asked them for a freeze exception
on 1.6.4, but haven't got a response yet.

... there shouldn t be a limit at

oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c0)  dave b    2010-09-29 09:03 UTC  ```  This is bad because the https implementation you are using (even wrapped using ssl) is broken as per bug <http://bugs.python.org/issue1589> as mercurial seems not to verify the common name. So your application is vulnerable, as long as I have a certificate signed by ca in the ca store, I can MITM it.  ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c1)  dave b    2010-09-29 09:04 UTC  ```  the vulnerable code is in mercurial/url.py -->  ssl = socket.ssl(sock, key_file, cert_fil for python  for python > 2.6 ...  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c2)  Thomas Arendsen Hein    2010-09-30 04:06 UTC  ```  There is a patch from kiilerix on mercurial-devel with comments from me.  ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c3)  dave b    2010-09-30 04:09 UTC  ```  Can you link me to the patch?  I am not on the mailing list :/  ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c4)  Thomas Arendsen Hein    2010-09-30 04:35 UTC  ```  * dave b <bugs@mercurial.selenic.com> [20100930 12:09]: > Can you link me to the patch?  > I am not on the mailing list :/  <http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2010-September/024854.html> <http://www.selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial-devel/2010-September/024862.html>  ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c5)  dave b    2010-09-30 04:38 UTC  ```  The tests look pretty good to me.  ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c6)  HG Bot    2010-09-30 18:00 UTC  ```  Fixed by <http://hg.intevation.org/mercurial/crew/rev/f2937d6492c5> Mads Kiilerich <mads@kiilerich.com> url: verify correctness of https server certificates (issue2407)  ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c7)  HG Bot    2010-10-16 21:00 UTC  ```  Fixed by <http://hg.intevation.org/mercurial/crew/rev/6ab4a7d3c179> Mads Kiilerich <mads@kiilerich.com> url: validity (notBefore/notAfter) is checked by OpenSSL (issue2407)  ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c8)  Thomas Arendsen Hein    2010-10-31 16:15 UTC  ```  Verified to work with python 2.6 and with python 2.5 + ssl 1.15.  Though the error message for expired certificates does not explain the reason, but just prints an ssl verification error.  One important problem: When http_proxy is set (and used), no host name verification is done!  ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c9)  kiilerix    2010-10-31 16:32 UTC  ```  The nice messages that were removed in 6ab4a7d3c179 would never have been used anyway, as wrap_socket would raise the generic exception in case of any problems.  Upstream is aware that it could be nice to have better error messages - see <http://bugs.python.org/issue1589#msg118844> .  Yes, I missed the proxy case. The fix for that seems to be much simpler than testing it ...  ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c10)  Matt Mackall    2010-11-02 13:33 UTC  ```  Reclosing. If there are outstanding issues that don't match $TITLE, please open a new issue for clarity.  ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2407#c11)  Bugzilla    2012-05-12 09:12 UTC  ```   --- Bug imported by bugzilla@serpentine.com 2012-05-12 09:12 EDT  ---  This bug was previously known as _bug_ 2407 at <http://mercurial.selenic.com/bts/issue2407>  ``` |  |
