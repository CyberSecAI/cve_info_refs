**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

The primary vulnerabilities detailed are:

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete database compromise.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, which can be used to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*  **Remote Command Injection:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands

**Impact:**
*   The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities ranges from low (XSS) to high (SQL injection, arbitrary code execution, remote command execution) depending on the specific vulnerability and the affected extension. Successful exploitation could lead to data breaches, complete system compromise, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vectors for these vulnerabilities are primarily over the network, meaning they can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   For most of these vulnerabilities, no authentication is required and the attack can be performed by an unauthenticated remote attacker

This information is consistent with the general nature of vulnerabilities described in CVE-2010-4956, making this document highly relevant.
