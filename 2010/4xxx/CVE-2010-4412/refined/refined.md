Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-4412:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within multiple PHP scripts of pfSense 2 beta 4. Specifically, user-supplied input in HTTP GET parameters is not being properly escaped or sanitized, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The identified vulnerabilities are Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These occur due to the failure to sanitize user-provided input before embedding it into the HTML output. The following files are vulnerable:
- `pkg_edit.php`
- `pkg.php`
- `status_graph.php`
- `interfaces.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a user's browser session when they access a vulnerable page. This can lead to various impacts such as:
- Stealing session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- Displaying fake content or phishing pages to trick users into divulging sensitive information.
- Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are through crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript payloads in specific query parameters.
- `pkg_edit.php?xml=olsrd.xml&id=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%282%29;%3C/script%3E`
- `pkg.php?xml=jailctl.xm%27l%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E`
- `status_graph.php?if=%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E`
- `interfaces.php?if=wan%22%22/%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver malicious URLs to a user of the pfSense web interface.
- The victim needs to access the crafted URL while logged into the pfSense web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE specifically addresses vulnerabilities present in *pfSense 2 beta 4 only*.
- The `graph.php` vulnerability, affecting both stable and 2 beta 4 versions, was assigned CVE-2010-4246.
- The vulnerability was present despite a previous effort to make scripts XSS input safe in 2008 as documented in the cvstrac entry.
