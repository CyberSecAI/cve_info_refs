| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=329582#c0)  YGN Ethical Hacker Group [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2010-11-05 15:35:56 EDT  ``` Build Identifier: 20100917-0705  The /help/index.jsp and /help/advanced/content.jsp URLs are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting. XSS with /help/advanced/content.jsp url makes the browser hang but even after clicking "Stop Executing" button, users can still get XSS.   See the sample exploit.  <http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/advisories/eclipse/helios/help_server_xss/eclipse_ie_xss_demo.htm>   .    Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open "Help Contents" under Help menu of Eclipse 2. Note its random port number by seeing status bar of Help Window 3. Request the follow urls with Internet Explorer  http://localhost:[REPLACE]/help/index.jsp?'onload='alert(0) http://localhost:[REPLACE]/help/advanced/content.jsp?'onload='alert(0)  Replace [REPLACE] with your own port number. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=329582#c1)  Chris Goldthorpe [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2010-11-08 14:35:40 EST  ``` Created [attachment 182653](attachment.cgi?id=182653&action=diff "Patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=182653&action=edit "Patch") Patch  There are two problems uncovered by this bug. This patch fixes the major problem, which is the XSS vulnerability. The other less serious issue is described in [Bug 329699](show_bug.cgi?id=329699 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Webapp] Opening /help/advanced/content.jsp causes unresponsive script") - [Webapp] Opening /help/advanced/content.jsp causes unresponsive script. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=329582#c2)  Chris Goldthorpe [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2010-11-08 14:42:08 EST  ``` Patch applied to HEAD, Fixed ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=329582#c3)  Chris Goldthorpe [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2010-11-08 14:42:56 EST  ``` Resolving as Fixed ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=329582#c4)  Chris Goldthorpe [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2011-02-16 16:53:17 EST  ``` Created [attachment 189137](attachment.cgi?id=189137&action=diff "Patch for 3.5 maintenance stream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=189137&action=edit "Patch for 3.5 maintenance stream") Patch for 3.5 maintenance stream  I have applied this patch to the 3.5 maintenance stream. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=329582#c5)  David Klein [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2011-02-18 10:40:04 EST  ``` Requesting that a patch be provided for 3.4.2 as this is the version our products are currently using.  Our next release will be on the 3.6.x level.  Will the 3.5 stream patch work for 3.6.2?  Also, we have releases still under service that use 3.4 as well as 3.2.2.  Hopefully a patch for 3.4.2 would essentially be the same for 3.4.  I realize 3.2.2 is another story. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=329582#c6)  Chris Goldthorpe [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2011-02-18 12:00:58 EST  ``` I've applied to the 3.4 maintenance stream the same patch as was applied to the 3.5 maintenance stream ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=329582#c7)  John Arthorne [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2011-06-10 14:21:56 EDT  ``` Removing security restriction for bugs that have been fixed in 3.6.2 or earlier. ``` |  |

Subject: CVE Request: Eclipse IDE Version: 3.6.1 | Help Server Local Cross
 Site Scripting (XSS)

==============================================================================
 Eclipse IDE | Help Server Local Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
==============================================================================

1. OVERVIEW

The Help Content web application of Eclipse IDE was vulnerable to
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability.

2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Eclipse is a multi-language software development environment
comprising an integrated development environment (IDE) and an
extensible plug-in system. It is written mostly in Java and can be
used to develop applications in Java and, by means of various
plug-ins, other programming languages including Ada, C, C++, COBOL,
Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala,
and Scheme. The IDE is often called Eclipse ADT for Ada, Eclipse CDT
for C/C++, Eclipse JDT for Java, and Eclipse PDT for PHP.

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Eclipse Help Contents are served as a web application via the built-in
Jetty Web Server plugin. Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities were
found in  /help/index.jsp and /help/advanced/content.jsp URLs. XSS on
/help/advanced/content.jsp url makes the browser hang
but even after clicking "Stop Executing" button, users can still get XSS.

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

Eclipse IDE Version: 3.6.1 <=

Tested Editions(SDK, Java, J2EE)

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

http://localhost:[REPLACE]/help/index.jsp?'onload='alert(0)
http://localhost:[REPLACE]/help/advanced/content.jsp?'onload='alert(0)

Script-Check:
Request: /advanced/content.jsp?'onload='alert(0)
Response: src='contentToolbar.jsp?'onload='alert(0)'

6. IMPACT

In a situation where users' browser security settings are weak, the
localized XSS vector could enable attackers to perform a number of
black acts including cross site content access, smb shares
enumeration, remote code execution, malicious trojan downloading and
execution ...etc.

7. SOLUTION

Apply the recent error-free nightly builds (ie.
<http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/N20101110-2000/index.php>)
.
According to the developer, "Chris Goldthorpe", the fix is in the
nightly build, <http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/N20101108-2000/index.php>
, it will also be in 3.6.2 (February 2011) and 3.7 (June 2011).
