  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2010-4375": {
      "details": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists when parsing a RealMedia file containing a malformed multi-rate audio stream. The application explicitly trusts two 16-bit values in this data structure which are then used to calculate the size used for an allocation. When data is written to this allocated buffer, an overflow will occur which can lead to code execution under the context of the current user.",
      "root_cause": "A malformed multi-rate audio stream within a RealMedia file leads to an integer overflow during size calculation for buffer allocation.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Buffer Overflow",
         "Improper Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the current user.",
      "attack_vector": "By visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious RealMedia file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must create a specially crafted RealMedia file. The victim must then interact with this file or a webpage hosting it. No authentication or other special privileges are required beyond user level access.",
      "additional_information": "RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['8441']"
