| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=656264#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-11-23 11:16:17 UTC  ``` posix-cpu-timers: workaround to suppress the problems with mt exec      posix-cpu-timers.c correctly assumes that the dying process does posix_cpu_timers_exit_group() and removes all !CPUCLOCK_PERTHREAD timers from signal->cpu_timers list.      But, it also assumes that timer->it.cpu.task is always the group leader, and thus the dead ->task means the dead thread group.      This is obviously not true after de_thread() changes the leader. After that almost every posix_cpu_timer_ method has problems.      It is not simple to fix this bug correctly. First of all, I think that timer->it.cpu should use struct pid instead of task_struct. Also, the locking should be reworked completely. In particular, tasklist_lock should not be used at all. This all needs a lot of nontrivial and hard-to-test changes.      Change __exit_signal() to do posix_cpu_timers_exit_group() when the old leader dies during exec. This is not the fix, just the temporary hack to hide the problem for 2.6.37 and stable. IOW, this is obviously wrong but this is what we currently have anyway: cpu timers do not work after mt exec.      In theory this change adds another race. The exiting leader can detach the timers which were attached to the new leader. However, the window between de_thread() and release_task() is small, we can pretend that sys_timer_create() was called before de_thread().  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/e0a70217107e6f9844628120412cb27bb4cea194>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=656264#c3)  Kyle McMartin    2010-11-23 16:44:58 UTC  ``` Thanks Eugene, committed for Fedora.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=656264#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-11-25 07:16:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not have support for CPU time clocks for the POSIX clock interface.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
