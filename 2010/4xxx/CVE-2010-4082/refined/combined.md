1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update to the SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP 1 Realtime Extension
kernel brings various bug and lots of security fixes.
This update also integrates upstream 2.6.33.7-rt29->2.6.33.7.2-rt30
changes.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-2962: Missing sanity checks in pread/pwrite in the i915
graphics driver allowed local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and
so gain privileges. This required a i915 graphics card to be effective.
CVE-2010-3310: Multiple integer signedness errors in net/rose/af\_rose.c
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a rose\_getname function call, related to the rose\_bind and
rose\_connect functions.
CVE-2010-3080: A double free in an alsa error path was fixed, which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-3081: Incorrect buffer handling in the biarch-compat buffer
handling could be used by local attackers to gain root privileges. This
problem affects foremost x86\_64, or potentially other biarch platforms,
like PowerPC and S390x.
CVE-2010-2960: The keyctl\_session\_to\_parent function in
security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel expects that a certain
parent session keyring exists, which allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a KEYCTL\_SESSION\_TO\_PARENT
argument to the keyctl function.
CVE-2010-3084: A buffer overflow in the ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL code
could be used to crash the kernel or potentially execute code.
CVE-2010-2955: A kernel information leak via the WEXT ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-3301: Mismatch between 32bit and 64bit register usage in the
system call entry path could be used by local attackers to gain root
privileges. This problem only affects x86\_64 kernels.
CVE-2010-3298: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/usb/hso driver.
CVE-2010-3296: Fixed a kernel information leak in the cxgb3 driver.
CVE-2010-3297: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/eql driver.
CVE-2010-3078: Fixed a kernel information leak in the xfs filesystem.
CVE-2010-3079: Fixed a ftrace NULL pointer dereference problem which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-2954: The irda\_bind function in net/irda/af\_irda.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle failure of the irda\_open\_tsap
function, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified
other impact via multiple unsuccessful calls to bind on an AF\_IRDA
(aka PF\_IRDA) socket.
CVE-2010-2959: Integer overflow in net/can/bcm.c in the Controller
Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel allowed attackers
to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (system crash)
via crafted CAN traffic.
CVE-2010-2946: The 'os2' xattr namespace on the jfs filesystem could
be used to bypass xattr namespace rules.
CVE-2010-2942: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net scheduler
code.
CVE-2010-3015: Integer overflow in the ext4\_ext\_get\_blocks function
in fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (BUG and system crash) via a write operation on
the last block of a large file, followed by a sync operation.
CVE-2010-2803: The drm\_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_drv.c
in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel
allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from
kernel memory by requesting a large memory-allocation amount.
CVE-2010-2226: The xfs\_swapext function in fs/xfs/xfs\_dfrag.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly check the file descriptors passed to
the SWAPEXT ioctl, which allowed local users to leverage write access
and obtain read access by swapping one file into another file.
CVE-2010-3849: The econet\_sendmsg function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel, when an econet address is configured, allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
and OOPS) via a sendmsg call that specifies a NULL value for the
remote address field.
CVE-2010-3848: Stack-based buffer overflow in the econet\_sendmsg
function in net/econet/af\_econet.c in the Linux kernel when an econet
address is configured, allowed local users to gain privileges by
providing a large number of iovec structures.
CVE-2010-3850: The ec\_dev\_ioctl function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel did not require the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability,
which allowed local users to bypass intended access restrictions and
configure econet addresses via an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4347: A local user could inject ACPI code into the kernel
via the world-writable "custom\_debug" file, allowing local privilege
escalation.
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address
in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with
other issues.
CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth\_ioctl\_alloc
could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.
CVE-2010-4165: The do\_tcp\_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP\_MAXSEG (aka MSS)
values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a
divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer.
CVE-2010-4164: A remote (or local) attacker communicating over X.25
could cause a kernel panic by attempting to negotiate malformed
facilities.
CVE-2010-4175: A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the
RDS protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is
considered not to be exploitable.
CVE-2010-4169: Use-after-free vulnerability in mm/mprotect.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service via
vectors involving an mprotect system call.
CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module
was fixed. Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not
exploitable.
CVE-2010-4158: A memory information leak in Berkeley packet filter
rules allowed local attackers to read uninitialized memory of the
kernel stack.
CVE-2010-4162: A local denial of service in the blockdevice layer
was fixed.
CVE-2010-4163: By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length,
a local user could have caused a kernel panic.
CVE-2010-3861: The ethtool\_get\_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory,
which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information
via an ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule\_cnt
value.
CVE-2010-3881: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structure members, which allows local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via read operations on the /dev/kvm device.
CVE-2010-3442: Multiple integer overflows in the snd\_ctl\_new function
in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted (1) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD or
(2) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_REPLACE ioctl call.
CVE-2010-3437: A range checking overflow in pktcdvd ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-4078: The sisfb\_ioctl function in drivers/video/sis/sis\_main.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a certain structure
member, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel stack memory via an FBIOGET\_VBLANK ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4080: The snd\_hdsp\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSP\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4081: The snd\_hdspm\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSPM\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4082: The viafb\_ioctl\_get\_viafb\_info function in
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a VIAFB\_GET\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
CVE-2010-3432: The sctp\_packet\_config function in net/sctp/output.c
in the Linux kernel performed extraneous initializations of packet
data structures, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (panic) via a certain sequence of SCTP traffic.
CVE-2010-3067: Integer overflow in the do\_io\_submit function in
fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted use
of the io\_submit system call.
CVE-2010-3865: A iovec integer overflow in RDS sockets was fixed
which could lead to local attackers gaining kernel privileges.
CVE-2010-3904: A local privilege escalation in RDS sockets allowed
local attackers to gain root privileges.
2) Solution or Work-Around
Please install the updated packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 kernel was updated to
2.6.32.27 and fixes various bugs and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address
in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with
other issues.
CVE-2010-4160: An overflow in sendto() and recvfrom() routines was
fixed that could be used by local attackers to potentially crash the
kernel using some socket families like L2TP.
CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth\_ioctl\_alloc
could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.
CVE-2010-4165: The do\_tcp\_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP\_MAXSEG (aka MSS)
values, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a
divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer.
CVE-2010-4164: A remote (or local) attacker communicating over X.25
could cause a kernel panic by attempting to negotiate malformed
facilities.
CVE-2010-4175: A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the
RDS protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is
considered not to be exploitable.
CVE-2010-4169: Use-after-free vulnerability in mm/mprotect.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service via
vectors involving an mprotect system call.
CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module
was fixed. Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not
exploitable.
CVE-2010-4158: A memory information leak in Berkeley packet filter
rules allowed local attackers to read uninitialized memory of the
kernel stack.
CVE-2010-4162: A local denial of service in the blockdevice layer
was fixed.
CVE-2010-4163: By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length,
a local user could have caused a kernel panic.
CVE-2010-3861: The ethtool\_get\_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory,
which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information
via an ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule\_cnt
value.
CVE-2010-3881: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structure members, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via read operations on the /dev/kvm device.
CVE-2010-3437: A range checking overflow in pktcdvd ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-4082: The viafb\_ioctl\_get\_viafb\_info function in
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a VIAFB\_GET\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory disclosures

I'll omit descriptions here to save space, since they were already
provided.  I'll keep the same organization as last time, just to make
it easier.  Issues that haven't been fixed yet are for the most part
planned for 2.6.37.  Patches were submitted for all issues, so it's
mostly just a matter of time.

# [PATCH] drivers/video/via/ioctl.c: prevent reading uninitializedstack memory

The VIAFB\_GET\_INFO device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 1968

bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the "reserved" member of

the viafb\_ioctl\_info struct declared on the stack is not altered or

zeroed before being copied back to the user. This patch takes care of

it.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory disclosures

I'd like to request CVEs for a large series of Linux kernel stack
memory disclosure vulnerabilities, almost all of which have been
fixed.  They are all examples of declaring various structs on the
stack and copying them back to the user without filling in all the
fields, leaking uninitialized stack memory.  Since there are a lot of
issues here, I trust your judgment in deciding if they should each
receive a unique ID or if they should be combined in some way.  I
tried to break them up logically to make it easier.

---

The first batch of issues occurred in the TIOCGICOUNT device ioctls of
several device drivers.  While several of the issues were fixed on an
individual basis, Alan Cox fixed it for good by creating a new
handler.  Since these issues are essentially identical and were fixed
all at once, I think it might make sense to have them under a single
CVE.  Note that the final listed item in drivers/net/usb/hso.c was
already assigned CVE-2010-3298.

"The TIOCGICOUNT device ioctl in mos7720.c, mos7840.c, serial_core.c,
hso.c, amiserial.c, and nozomi.c allows unprivileged users to read
uninitialized stack memory, because the 'reserved' member of the
serial_icounter_struct struct declared on the stack is not altered or
zeroed before being copied back to the user."

Alan Cox's fix:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/16/294>

drivers/usb/serial/mos*
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a0846f1868b11cd827bdfeaf4527d8b1b1c0b098>

drivers/serial/serial_core.c
<http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/drivers-serial-serial_corec-prevent-reading-uninitialized-stack-memory.patch>

drivers/char/amiserial.c
<http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/drivers-char-amiserialc-prevent-reading-uninitialized-stack-memory.patch>

drivers/char/nozomi.c
<http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/drivers-char-nozomic-prevent-reading-uninitialized-stack-memory.patch>

<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=7011e660938fc44ed86319c18a5954e95a82ab3e>

---

The next two issues both occurred in the FBIOGET_VBLANK device ioctl:

"The FBIOGET_VBLANK device ioctl in sis_main.c and ivtvfb.c allows
unprivileged users to read 16 bytes of uninitialized stack memory,
because the 'reserved' member of the fb_vblank struct declared on the
stack is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user."

drivers/video/sis/sis_main.c
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=fd02db9de73faebc51240619c7c7f99bee9f65c7>

drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtvfb.c
lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/15/393

---

The following issues occured in miscellaneous device ioctls in a
variety of drivers.  Note the final two items listed have already been
assigned CVE-2010-3296 and CVE-2010-3297 - I include them only for
reference.

sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp*.c
<http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=128542726922720&w=2>

"The SNDRV_HDSP_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG_INFO and
SNDRV_HDSP_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG_INFO ioctls in hdspm.c and hdsp.c allow
unprivileged users to read uninitialized kernel stack memory, because
several fields of the hdsp{m}_config_info structs declared on the
stack are not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user."

drivers/video/via/ioctl.c
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=b4aaa78f4c2f9cde2f335b14f4ca30b01f9651ca>

"The VIAFB_GET_INFO device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 246
bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the 'reserved' member of
the viafb_ioctl_info struct declared on the stack is not altered or
zeroed before being copied back to the user."

drivers/net/cxgb3/cxgb3_main.c (CVE-2010-3296)
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=49c37c0334a9b85d30ab3d6b5d1acb05ef2ef6de>

"The CHELSIO_GET_QSET_NUM device ioctl allows unprivileged users to
read 4 bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the 'addr' member
of the ch_reg struct declared on the stack in cxgb_extension_ioctl()
is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user."  This
issue was assigned CVE-2010-3296.

drivers/net/eql.c (CVE-2010-3297)
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=44467187dc22fdd33a1a06ea0ba86ce20be3fe3c>

"The EQL_GETMASTRCFG device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 16
bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the 'master_name' member
of the master_config_t struct declared on the stack in
eql_g_master_cfg() is not altered or zeroed before being copied back
to the user."  This issue was assigned CVE-2010-3297.

---

The final identified leak is in the sys_semctl system call, which I
would say is more serious since it is not driver-specific:

ipc/sem.c
<http://www.spinics.net/lists/mm-commits/msg80234.html>

"The semctl syscall has several code paths that lead to the leakage of
uninitialized kernel stack memory (namely the IPC_INFO, SEM_INFO,
IPC_STAT, and SEM_STAT commands) during the use of the older, obsolete
version of the semid_ds struct.  The copy_semid_to_user() function
declares a semid_ds struct on the stack and copies it back to the user
without initializing or zeroing the 'sem_base', 'sem_pending',
'sem_pending_last', and 'undo' pointers, allowing the leakage of 16
bytes of kernel stack memory.  The code is still reachable on 32-bit
systems - when calling semctl() newer glibc's automatically OR the IPC
command with the IPC_64 flag, but invoking the syscall directly allows
users to use the older versions of the struct."

---

Let me know if you have any questions or need any clarification on any
of these issues.

Regards,
Dan

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The openSUSE 11.3 kernel was updated to fix various bugs and security
issues.
Following security issues have been fixed:
CVE-2010-4347: A local user could inject ACPI code into the kernel
via the world-writable "custom\_debug" file, allowing local privilege
escalation.
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address
in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with
other issues.
CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth\_ioctl\_alloc
could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.
CVE-2010-4165: The do\_tcp\_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP\_MAXSEG (aka MSS)
values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a
divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer.
CVE-2010-4164: A remote (or local) attacker communicating over X.25
could cause a kernel panic by attempting to negotiate malformed
facilities.
CVE-2010-4175: A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the
RDS protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is
considered not to be exploitable.
CVE-2010-4169: Use-after-free vulnerability in mm/mprotect.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service via
vectors involving an mprotect system call.
CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module
was fixed. Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not
exploitable.
CVE-2010-4158: A memory information leak in Berkeley packet filter
rules allowed local attackers to read uninitialized memory of the
kernel stack.
CVE-2010-4162: A local denial of service in the blockdevice layer
was fixed.
CVE-2010-4163: By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length,
a local user could have caused a kernel panic.
CVE-2010-0435: The Hypervisor in KVM 83, when the Intel VT-x extension
is enabled, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via vectors related to
instruction emulation.
CVE-2010-3861: The ethtool\_get\_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory,
which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information
via an ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule\_cnt
value.
CVE-2010-3442: Multiple integer overflows in the snd\_ctl\_new function
in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted (1) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD or
(2) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_REPLACE ioctl call.
CVE-2010-3437: A range checking overflow in pktcdvd ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-4078: The sisfb\_ioctl function in drivers/video/sis/sis\_main.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a certain structure
member, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel stack memory via an FBIOGET\_VBLANK ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4080: The snd\_hdsp\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSP\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4081: The snd\_hdspm\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSPM\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4082: The viafb\_ioctl\_get\_viafb\_info function in
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a VIAFB\_GET\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
CVE-2010-3432: The sctp\_packet\_config function in net/sctp/output.c
in the Linux kernel performed extraneous initializations of packet
data structures, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (panic) via a certain sequence of SCTP traffic.
CVE-2010-3067: Integer overflow in the do\_io\_submit function in
fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted use
of the io\_submit system call.
CVE-2010-3865: A iovec integer overflow in RDS sockets was fixed
which could lead to local attackers gaining kernel privileges.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory disclosures

While these are pending, a few more of the same problem (uninitialized
structure members being copied back to userspace, leaking kernel stack
memory) have come up.  These are similar or related to the previous
ipc/sem.c leak.

ipc/shm.c (shmctl), reported and fixed by Kees Cook
Affects >= 2.6.0, >= 2.4.0

Reference:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/6/454>

ipc/compat.c (compat versions of semctl, shmctl, and msgctl)
Affects >= 2.6.8

ipc/compat_mq (compat versions of mq_open and mq_getsetattr)
Affects >= 2.6.8

Reference:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/6/492>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update of the openSUSE 11.2 kernel fixes various bugs
and lots of security issues.
Following security issues have been fixed:
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address in the
kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with other issues.
CVE-2010-4160: A overflow in sendto() and recvfrom() routines was fixed
that could be used by local attackers to potentially crash the kernel
using some socket families like L2TP.
CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth\_ioctl\_alloc
could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.
CVE-2010-4165: The do\_tcp\_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP\_MAXSEG (aka MSS) values, which
allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via a setsockopt
call that specifies a small value, leading to a divide-by-zero error or
incorrect use of a signed integer.
CVE-2010-4164: A remote (or local) attacker communicating over X.25
could cause a kernel panic by attempting to negotiate malformed
facilities.
CVE-2010-4175: A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the RDS
protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is considered
not to be exploitable.
CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module was fixed.
Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not exploitable.
CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module was fixed.
Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not exploitable.
CVE-2010-4158: A memory information leak in Berkeley packet filter rules
allowed local attackers to read uninitialized memory of the kernel stack.
CVE-2010-4162: A local denial of service in the blockdevice layer was fixed.
CVE-2010-4163: By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length, a local
user could have caused a kernel panic.
CVE-2010-3861: The ethtool\_get\_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory,
which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information via
an ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule\_cnt value.
CVE-2010-3442: Multiple integer overflows in the snd\_ctl\_new function
in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted (1) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD or
(2) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_REPLACE ioctl call.
CVE-2010-3437: A range checking overflow in pktcdvd ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-4078: The sisfb\_ioctl function in drivers/video/sis/sis\_main.c in
the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a certain structure member,
which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information
from kernel stack memory via an FBIOGET\_VBLANK ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4080: The snd\_hdsp\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSP\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4081: The snd\_hdspm\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSPM\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4082: The viafb\_ioctl\_get\_viafb\_info function in
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
a VIAFB\_GET\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-3067: Integer overflow in the do\_io\_submit function in fs/aio.c
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service or
possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted use of the io\_submit
system call.
CVE-2010-3865: A iovec integer overflow in RDS sockets was fixed which
could lead to local attackers gaining kernel privileges.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
