  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the `novell-tftp.exe` component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length heap buffer without proper bounds checking.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the ZenWorks user.",
  "Attack vectors": "A long TFTP request sent to the vulnerable server via UDP port 69.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
