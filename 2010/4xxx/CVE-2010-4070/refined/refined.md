{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A lack of sanity checking on supplied parameter sizes within the RPC protocol parsing library (librpc.dll) leads to an integer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap buffer under allocation",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on vulnerable IBM Informix Dynamic Server installations.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network. Specifically, by sending a malformed RPC request to the ISM Portmapper service (portmap.exe) on TCP port 36890.",
    "required_capabilities": "No authentication is required. The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service.",
     "details": "The vulnerability resides in the librpc.dll, a library used by the ISM Portmapper service (portmap.exe). By sending a crafted RPC request with specific parameter sizes, an attacker can trigger an integer overflow. This overflow results in a heap buffer under allocation, which ultimately leads to memory corruption that allows for remote code execution. The service by default listens on TCP port 36890."
