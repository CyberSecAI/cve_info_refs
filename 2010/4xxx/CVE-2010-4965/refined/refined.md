The provided content discusses a vulnerability in the D-Link DCS-2121 IP camera, specifically a command injection vulnerability, but also mentions the presence of a hardcoded password.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure use of the `system()` function in the `recorder_test.cgi` script. User-supplied parameters are passed directly to the `smbmount` command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Command Injection:** The `recorder_test.cgi` script is vulnerable to semicolon injection because it doesn't properly sanitize user-provided inputs before passing them to the `system()` function, specifically the password parameter used within the `smbmount` command. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
2.  **Hardcoded Credentials:** The root password for the device is hardcoded to "admin" which is stored in `/etc/shadow`
3.  **Telnetd Service:** A CGI script, `telnetd.cgi`, exists which can be used to start or stop the telnet daemon.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
1.  **Remote Code Execution:** Gain arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the affected device.
2.  **Full System Control:** Obtain a shell on the device using telnet which grants full control of the device.
3. **Access camera feed and other data**: With full system control the attacker can access any data on the device, such as camera feeds.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Web Interface:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `recorder_test.cgi` script, injecting commands through the password parameter.
2.  **`telnetd.cgi`:** The attacker can enable the telnet service by accessing the `telnetd.cgi` script via the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the IP camera's web interface.
2.  **Authentication:** Although the vulnerability requires authentication to access the vulnerable CGI scripts, the device ships with a hardcoded root password, making exploitation trivial. This effectively removes the authentication barrier, since the attacker can login as root, and use the injected command to spawn a root shell.
