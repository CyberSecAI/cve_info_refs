# Example of a back reference field for Rational ClearQuest.

### Question & Answer

## Question

How can you create a back reference field in IBM® Rational® ClearQuest®?

## Answer

A back reference field would be used to be able to not only see the child records of a parent record type, but also to be able to see the parent records that are associated to that child record type. For example, a back reference field would be used if a user would like to see which customers have experienced a specific defect and would also like to know all of the defects a certain customer has experienced.

1. Log in to the Rational ClearQuest Designer and check out the schema.
2. Create a field in the defect record type called **"Related\_customers"**. This is of type REFERENCE\_LIST to the Customer record type.
3. Next, add a back reference called **"Related\_defects"**. "Related\_defects" will now be a read-only field that automatically gets created in the Customer stateless record type.
4. Drag the **"Related\_customers"** field onto the Defect record type form. This will create a list view box with 3 buttons (Add, New, and Remove).
5. Now go into the Customer stateless record type. Drag **"Related\_defects"** field onto the Customer record type form. Both of them are parent/child or list view type field properties. The related\_customer field will have the **Add, New**, and **Remove** buttons, but the back referenced field (related\_defects) on the customer form will not. This is because a user can add or create a new customer from the Defect record type, but cannot create a new defect from the Customer record type.
6. In the Rational ClearQuest client, for example there are 2 customers: Sue and Joe. If no customer records exist in the database, add two test customers.
7. Login to the user database (SAMPL in this example) and submit 5 defects.

1. Submit defect SAMPL000001 - Assume that no one is experiencing this problem, so do not add Sue or Joe to the related\_customers field.
2. Submit defect SAMPL000002 - This was reported by Sue. Go to the related\_customers field and "Add" Sue to the list.
3. Submit defect SAMPL000003 - This is a known problem that both Joe and Sue have reported. Here, "Add" both Joe and Sue.
4. Submit defect SAMPL000004 - This is a known problem that both Joe and Sue have reported. Here, "Add" both Joe and Sue again.
5. Submit defect SAMPL000005 - This was reported by Joe. Go to the related\_customers field and "Add" Joe to the list.

Without ever doing anything to the customer records, run a query on the Customer record type. To see all of the defects that Sue has experienced, go into the Sue customer record. A read-only field called related\_defects will be seen. SAMPL000002, SAMPL000003, and SAMPL000004 should be listed.
