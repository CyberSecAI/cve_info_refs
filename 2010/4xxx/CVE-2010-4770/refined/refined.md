Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4770:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the DVD Rental Software. Specifically, it is located in the `index.php` script when handling catalog view requests, triggered via the `cat_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into SQL queries. The `cat_id` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data exposure:** By injecting SQL code, an attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database. In this case, the attacker can specifically extract the admin username and password by exploiting the vulnerable `cat_id` parameter.
- **Potential for full database compromise:** SQL injection can potentially lead to more extensive attacks like modifying data, deleting records, and even executing operating system commands on the server if the database user has such permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request, specifically by manipulating the `cat_id` parameter within the URL. The injection occurs within the vulnerable parameter in the HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require the attacker to be authenticated.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter (`cat_id`).

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit example uses a union-based SQL injection technique.
- The injection `cat_id=-18+union+select+1,2,concat(admin_name,0x3a,admin_password),4,5+from+rental_admin--` aims to retrieve the `admin_name` and `admin_password` from the `rental_admin` table.
- `0x3a` represents a colon (:) in hexadecimal, used as a separator between the username and password in the concatenated output.
- The `--` comments out the rest of the SQL query, preventing errors.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `http://server/path/index.php`.
- The vulnerable script appears to handle requests with the following parameters `view=catalog&item_type=M` .
- The exploit was published on 19/11/2010 and assigned CVE-2010-4770.
- The vulnerability has a high risk, with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10.
