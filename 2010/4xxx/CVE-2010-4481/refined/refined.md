Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-4481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of an unauthenticated user to access the output of PHP's `phpinfo()` function. This function exposes detailed information about the PHP environment, including configuration settings, extensions, and server information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive system information through the `phpinfo()` output.
- **Configuration Flaw:** The issue occurs if the `$cfg['ShowPhpInfo']` setting is enabled in the phpMyAdmin configuration. This setting controls whether to display the `phpinfo()` output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Attackers could gain insights into the server's configuration, software versions, and other sensitive details. This information can be used to plan further attacks or exploit other vulnerabilities on the system.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The information obtained could be used for more targeted attacks, or used in combination with other vulnerabilities to achieve more serious damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users over the network. The attacker only needs to access the phpMyAdmin web interface with the 'ShowPhpInfo' option enabled

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability
- **Network connectivity** The attacker must be able to access the web server where phpMyAdmin is hosted.
- **Knowledge of phpMyAdmin URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL path of the phpMyAdmin installation to reach the vulnerable page.

**Additional Details:**
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is considered minor because the `ShowPhpInfo` option is disabled by default in phpMyAdmin installations. The fix is also available in the latest version of phpmyadmin.
- **Affected Versions:**  All phpMyAdmin versions prior to 3.4.0-beta1 are vulnerable.
- **CWE:**  The issue is associated with CWE-661 (Incorrect Selection of COA) and CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
