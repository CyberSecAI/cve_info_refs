# Embark on an Interstellar Journey with Alien Robots Slots!

Mar 24, 2024

![Sizzling Scorpions1](https://b1370496.smushcdn.com/1370496/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sizzling-Scorpions1.jpg?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1)

According to me there is certain incident which makes us to follow something and of course there should be some influencing factor too. In the same way entering in the [world of gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_in_New_Zealand) for me was an incident and now I really enjoy it during my spare part of time. I was watching a movie through online and I got a link which was related to the pokie which was popping on the screen. I went for the click of that which introduced me with the environment of betting. The game which I generally use to play is the Sizzling Scorpions which offers three reels with single line of pay and some [bonuses](https://www.exploitdevelopment.com/types-of-bingo-jackpots/) too. This is themed on desert look which may increase your thirst for getting more and [more win.](https://www.exploitdevelopment.com/fbpool/query.htm)

The scorpion logo is itself the biggest symbols of winning while there are many other symbols such as sun, bars, 7’s are the smaller one. For getting the round the round of bonus you will have to go with the waging of three coins which also activates the stage of jackpot which will give you the more which is about 5,000 coins.

If you really want to perform much better as the introducer to this one then you basics should be quite clear. You should go for the tutorial and review of the blogs. As a new comer I was lucky that I made the best performance when I played this one for the first time using some of the [skills](http://www.quintcareers.com/job_skills_values.html) and some of the concept which I read in my college days. The graphics of this one is really totally different depicting the life style of desert which is very cool. I was fortunate that I was on the winning side with some loses at the starting. Triumph is not only the thing which you should look out for rather than learning something from it which will automatically increase your appetite of triumph.

## Alien Robots Slots

Net Entertainment created this space-age [slot game](https://www.exploitdevelopment.com/scalping-the-casino-cash-bonuses/) in tribute to animatronic robot lovers. It features stunning graphics and sounds reminiscent of your favorite robotic characters.

This fun theme features animated robot toys in rainbow colors. Symbol animations are blinking, pixels, numbers, and letters, while robots with higher values are valued according to their color. The robots are listed in descending order of importance: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and yellow. The wild symbol is a white-faced robot that glows pink and has a clear skull. It emits lightning bolts when activated. The scatter symbol is a UFO that emits bright green light and takes off. The background sound is a faint hum as if the player is in a spaceship. Digital squeaks and pips punctuate the hum. It sounds like robots communicating. The game’s sound effects are similar to classic arcade sounds but have a solid digital tone.

### Features

These sticky wilds expand to cover all reels and remain in place, while other reels offer higher chances of winning. After the re-spin, the expanded sticky wilds will return to their standard wild form. This game’s wild symbol will replace all other symbols except the scatter symbols.
