Subject: Re: CVE request: kernel: CAN information leak, 2nd
 attempt

Hmmm, a couple things going on here.  I'm fine with associating
CVE-2010-3874 with the overflow.  But note - if the overflow does not
affect any decision-making, bypass protection logic, or cause a DoS (e.g.
if certain values of the overflowed field cause a CPU hit), then it's
probably OK to treat it as non-security.  There hasn't been much security
analysis done in semantic overflows and we probably have to treat them on
a case-by-case basis.  For example - if the last field happens to be a
bank account balance, or a flag stating whether a user has some kind of
special privilege, then that's a security issue even without memory
corruption (or rather, it's still "memory" corruption, just not with the
same kinds of management structures that we usually run into currently).

Use CVE-2010-4565 for the kernel address leak.

Besides the ongoing(?) discussion about the exposed kernel addresses in procfs
- what are your plans about this patch that already moves the kernel addresses
to inode numbers?

Is it something for net-2.6 / net-next-2.6 / stable ?

Especially in this case we do not see any problems with userspace tools that
could break as it would be for some other /proc/net entries.

Once this patch is applied (and the procfs layout is changed anyway), i'd also
like to send a patch from my backlog that would extend the procfs output for
can-bcm with an additional drop counter.

Best regards,
Oliver

# [SECURITY] CAN info leak/minor heap overflow

* *Subject*: [SECURITY] CAN info leak/minor heap overflow
* *From*: Dan Rosenberg <drosenberg@xxxxxxxxxxxxx>
* *Date*: Tue, 02 Nov 2010 14:28:23 -0400
* *Cc*: netdev@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, security@xxxxxxxxxx

---

```
In bcm_connect() (in net/can/bcm.c), I noticed the following code:

	sprintf(bo->procname, "%p", sock);

"procname" is a 9-byte char array.  This code is wrong on two levels.
First, leaking a kernel address via a /proc filename is bad.  Secondly,
on 64-bit platforms, up to 17 bytes may be copied into the buffer.
Fortunately, structure padding will most likely prevent this from being
a problem, except for the trailing NULL byte, which may overwrite the
first byte of the next heap object.  Please name your procfile in a way
that doesn't leak information and fits into the desired name buffer.

-Dan

This is a bad idea because it makes exploiting other kernel
vulnerabilities easier.  Exposing the address of an object in a slab
cache, especially an object that unprivileged users have some level of
control of, is just an invitation to use that structure when writing
exploits, for heap overflows or otherwise.

Hm, summarizing the given restrictions and taking into account that just
setting the pointer fields to '0' is said to be annoying, the only thing that
can be fixed is the minor heap overflow caused by the char array. I'll send a
patch for that.

As you don't want to change the layout even if there's no tool relying on the
entries i wanted to modify, i'll just stop my attempts to improve it.

Regards,
Oliver

Subject: CVE request: kernel: CAN information leak

The CAN protocol uses the address of a kernel heap object as a proc
filename, revealing information that could be useful during
exploitation.

The below post also mentions a heap overflow.  While there is a
semantic overflow (17 bytes being copied into a 9-byte buffer), in
reality, the object whose member is being overflowed resides in a
kernel heap slab cache that includes enough padding that there is no
possible corruption.  So, it's a bug but not a vulnerability.

------------

Please note that there has been one attempt to request CVE for this
issue already [1]. The problem is that vendors (Red Hat more or less
included) used the assigned CVE for the potential heap overflow issue
[2, 3] whereas reporter used it for information leak [4].

  [1] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2010/q4/107>
  [2] <http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2010-12/msg00026.html>
  [3] <http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2126>
  [4] <http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/drosenbe/research.html>

I'd suggest to keep the CVE-2010-3874 id for the heap overflow which
has some (although very limited) security potential and assign a new id
for the information leak.

Thanks,
