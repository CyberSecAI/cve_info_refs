The provided content describes a vulnerability in the ftpd daemon on FreeBSD and OpenBSD, related to how it handles globbing requests.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `popen.c` file within the ftpd daemon. This occurs when the `glob()` function, used for filename expansion, returns a zeroed-out `glob_t` structure (specifically when `gl_pathc` is 0). The code proceeds to dereference `gl.gl_pathv` without checking if `gl_pathc` is greater than zero which results in a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code dereferences `gl.gl_pathv` without validating if the returned structure is valid.
- Lack of input validation: The ftpd does not properly validate the results of the `glob()` function before using the returned data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability leads to the ftpd process crashing, resulting in a denial of service. The FTP service becomes unavailable until the daemon restarts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attack can be performed remotely by sending a crafted `ls` command with a specific glob pattern, using the FTP protocol.
- Crafted FTP command: The attacker sends an FTP `ls` command with a long directory and globbing pattern, such as `ls {W*/../W*/../W*/../W*/../W*/../W*/../W*/} ` to the FTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable FTP server.
- FTP client: The attacker needs to be able to send FTP commands to the server.
