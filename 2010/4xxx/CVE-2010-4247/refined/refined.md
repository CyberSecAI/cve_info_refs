Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unbounded request-processing loop within the `blkback` component of Xen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An improper or missing check within the `blkback` code allows a frontend (guest) to pass a bad index of a production request.
- This leads to the backend entering an infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop causes excessive CPU consumption on the Xen host.
- **Host Unresponsiveness:** The excessive CPU usage can render the Xen host unresponsive.
- A malicious guest can cause the hypervisor to become unresponsive, impacting the host and other virtual machines that are also hosted on it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious or compromised Xen guest can send a crafted request with a bad production request index.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control or the ability to manipulate the behavior of a Xen guest operating system.
- They need the ability to send crafted requests to the Xen hypervisor's `blkback` component.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by two upstream changesets:
    -   `77f831cbb91d`: Which fixes the unbounded request processing loop
    -   `7070d34f251c`: Which adds a check for `kthread_should_stop()` in the inner loop.
- The vulnerability affects various versions of Xen, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
- VMware ESX and ESXi products were also affected and addressed the vulnerability with patches
