{
  "CVE-2010-4175": {
    "Description": "A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the RDS protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is considered not to be exploitable.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in `rds_cmsg_rdma_args()` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory overruns, potentially leading to kernel crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system to trigger the vulnerable code path in the RDS protocol stack via `rds_cmsg_rdma_args` function with crafted input.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability occurs because the user-provided `args->nr_local` value is not adequately bounded, leading to an integer overflow when calculating the total iov_size. This overflow can result in a small `sock_kmalloc()` allocation, potentially causing a heap overflow when `rds_rdma_pages()` is called with a high count value.",
    "Affected Products": [
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time 11 SP1",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 11 SP1",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP1",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1",
      "openSUSE 11.3",
       "openSUSE 11.2"
    ]
