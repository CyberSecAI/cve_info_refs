{
  "CVE-2010-4327": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists within Novell's eDirectory Server's NCP implementation.",
      "Weaknesses": "The application processes a malformed FileSetLock request which leads to service unresponsiveness.",
       "Impact": "Denial of service. The service will become unresponsive resulting in an inability to authenticate to that server.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malformed NCP request sent to the eDirectory server on port 524.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication is required, the attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable port."
    }
