ID: CVE-2010-4838
Description: SQL injection vulnerability in the JSupport (com_jsupport) component 1.5.6 for Joomla! allows remote authenticated users, with Public Back-end permissions, to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the alpha parameter in a (1) listTickets or (2) listFaqs action to administrator/index.php.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `alpha` parameter when processing `listTickets` or `listFaqs` tasks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
SQL Injection (CWE-89)

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:
-Data theft: Access to sensitive information stored in the database.
-Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of data.
-Privilege escalation: Potential for gaining higher access levels if the database user has sufficient privileges.
-Arbitrary code execution: In some scenarios, SQL injection can be used to execute operating system commands on the server.

Attack vectors:
-The vulnerability is accessible through the Joomla administrator backend interface.
-The vulnerable URLs include:
    - `administrator/index.php?option=com_jsupport&task=listTickets&alpha=[SQL Injection]`
    - `administrator/index.php?option=com_jsupport&task=listFaqs&alpha=[SQL Injection]`

Required attacker capabilities/position:
-The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with "Public Back-end permissions".
-The attacker requires network access to the Joomla administrator interface.
