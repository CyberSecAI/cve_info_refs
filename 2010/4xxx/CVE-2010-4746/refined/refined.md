Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-4746:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory leak in the DN (Distinguished Name) normalization code and in the syntax normalization code of the 389 Directory Server.
- Specifically, in the DN normalization code, a `Slapi_Attr` struct was used on the stack, but its contents were not being freed.
- In the syntax normalization code, a pointer to a recently allocated string could be overwritten without freeing the string first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leaks due to improper handling of allocated memory in both DN and syntax normalization processes.
- Failure to free allocated memory for `Slapi_Attr` struct and strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A massive memory leak occurs, causing the directory server process to consume an increasing amount of memory.
- This can lead to performance degradation and potentially denial of service if the system runs out of memory.
- The specific report mentions a leak of approximately 500MB every 10 minutes in a specific use case.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the DN and syntax normalization process within the 389 Directory Server.
- The specific trigger involves operations that cause DNs or syntax to be normalized.
- One specific usage pattern mentioned is when memberOf plugin is in use. Specifically, the reporter mentioned having some badly behaved applications which set attributes to a value they are already set to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to perform operations that cause the server to perform DN and syntax normalizations.
- This would typically involve having the ability to modify attributes or perform operations that require DN processing within the directory server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in version 1.2.7.4 of the 389 Directory Server.
- A patch was created to address the issue by ensuring the `Slapi_Attr` struct is cleared out and allocated strings are freed.
- The fix was included in version 1.2.7.5.
- The bug report also provides a link to the Red Hat Errata that resolves this issue (RHBA-2011:0003).
- The memory leak was observed when using the memberof plugin.
