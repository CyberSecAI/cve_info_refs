Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-4945

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the Joomla! Component CamelcityDB version 2.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as usernames and passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL with injected SQL code in the `id` parameter of the `com_camelcitydb2` component. Specifically, the vulnerable file is `index.php?option=com_camelcitydb2&view=all&Itemid=15`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or access to the Joomla! application is needed.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement in the `id` parameter to extract data from the `jos_users` table:

`/index.php?option=com_camelcitydb2&id=-3+union+select+1,2,concat(username,0x3a,password),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11+from+jos_users--`

This query injects SQL code to bypass the intended query and retrieve concatenated usernames and passwords, separated by a colon, from the `jos_users` table.
