Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-4850

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple scripts within the Diferior application. Specifically, the identified vulnerable scripts are:
    *   `views/post.php`:  Fails to sanitize the `post_content` variable.
    *   `views/admin.php`: Fails to sanitize the `slogan` variable.
    *    `views/admin.php`: Fails to sanitize the `subcatname` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The application is susceptible to stored XSS attacks due to the failure to sanitize user-provided input before displaying it to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution**: Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Compromise of the application**: Successful exploitation can lead to a compromise of the application.
*   **Theft of cookie-based authentication credentials**: Attackers could steal user session cookies.
*   **Disclosure or modification of sensitive data**: Attackers may be able to access or alter sensitive information within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web browser**: Attackers use a web browser to send malicious requests to the server.
*   **HTTP POST requests**: Vulnerable parameters are submitted through HTTP POST requests.
*   **Manipulated form data**: Attackers craft malicious form data containing JavaScript code within vulnerable parameters (`post_content`, `slogan`, and `subcatname`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network access**: Attackers need network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** Attackers can use a web browser or similar tools to send malicious POST requests.
*   **No authentication required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Details:**
* The content provides proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability in each affected script by submitting crafted forms with malicious javascript in the vulnerable fields.

* The vulnerability affects Diferior version 8.03 and likely earlier versions.
* The vendor was notified but the issue was not yet fixed at the time of the report.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" risk with a CVSS base score of 4.3. The exploitability subscore is 8.6 which is relatively high, while the impact is considered lower at 2.9.
* The vulnerability is classified under CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
