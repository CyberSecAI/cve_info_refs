### CVE-2010-4168 (vulnerable 1.0.0 - fixed 1.0.5)

Short description: Denial of service (server/client) via invalid read

[Official CVE-2010-4168 entry at cve.mitre.org.](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4168)

Related commits:

* [673b371](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/commit/673b371)

Patches: (sometimes more fuzz is needed to apply them)

* [For version 1.0.0 up to including 1.0.4](/security/CVE-2010-4168/1.0.0%20-%201.0.4.patch)

When a client disconnects, without sending the “quit” or “client error” message,
the server has a chance of reading and writing a just freed piece of memory. The
chance depends on when the disconnect is noticed, whether OpenTTD can write to
the socket, and whether there are packets from the client waiting to be
processed. The writing can only happen while the server is sending the map.

For clients there is a chance that, upon reconnect after being disconnected
during the join process, a just freed piece of memory is read.

Depending on what happens directly after freeing the memory there is a chance
that a segmentation fault, and thus a denial of service will occur.

The attached patch does not change network compatability at all.

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi folks,

we, the OpenTTD developers, have identified a security vulnerability in
OpenTTD (an open source game with multiplayer). Would you be so kind as
to allocate a CVE id for this issue?

The issue concerns a denial of service vulnerability in the form of
reading and writing already freed memory. The first vulnerable version
is 1.0.0, the upcoming 1.0.5 release will have the issue fixed.

Once a CVE id is allocated, the issue will be documented at
<http://security.openttd.org/CVE-2010-xxxx>

Thanks in advance,
Remko 'Rubidium' Bijker
