Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Summary:**

This document is a collective security bulletin (CSB) detailing multiple vulnerabilities found in several third-party TYPO3 extensions. It lists seven different extensions, each with its own set of vulnerabilities, affected versions, and recommended solutions.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Extension: Event (event)**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
    *   **Affected Versions:** 0.3.4 and below
    *   **Impact:** High severity. Likely allows unauthorized database access, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack (AV:N), low access complexity (AC:L), no authentication required (Au:N)
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability without prior authentication.

2.  **Extension: Fe user statistic (festat)**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
    *   **Affected Versions:** 0.2.0 and below
    *   **Impact:** High severity. Similar to the "Event" extension, likely allowing unauthorized database access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack (AV:N), low access complexity (AC:L), no authentication required (Au:N)
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability without prior authentication.

3.  **Extension: JW Calendar (jw_calendar)**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** Arbitrary Code Execution
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.3.20 and below
    *   **Impact:** High severity. Could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack (AV:N), low access complexity (AC:L), no authentication required (Au:N)
    *  **Attacker Capabilities**: Remote attacker can execute code without prior authentication.
    *   **Note:** The extension was removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the inability to contact the author for a patch.

4.  **Extension: Questionnaire (ke_questionnaire)**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Affected Versions:** 2.2.2 and below
    *   **Impact:** Medium severity. SQL injection could lead to data breaches and XSS could allow for malicious script injection into the user’s browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
     *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack (AV:N), low access complexity (AC:L), no authentication required (Au:N)
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker can exploit without prior authentication.

5.  **Extension: Branchenbuch [Yellow Pages] (mh_branchenbuch)**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Affected Versions:** 0.9.0 and below
    *  **Impact:** Low severity. Allows malicious script injection into the user’s browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack (AV:N), low access complexity (AC:L), no authentication required (Au:N)
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker can exploit without prior authentication.

6.  **Extension: Webkit PDFs (webkitpdf)**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** Remote Command Injection, SQL Injection
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.1.3 and below
     *   **Impact:** High severity. Remote command injection can lead to server takeover and SQL Injection could result in data breaches.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack (AV:N), low access complexity (AC:L), no authentication required (Au:N)
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker can exploit without prior authentication.

7.  **Extension: xaJax Shoutbox (vx_xajax_shoutbox)**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.0 and below
    *  **Impact:** Low severity. Allows malicious script injection into the user’s browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attack (AV:N), low access complexity (AC:L), no authentication required (Au:N)
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker can exploit without prior authentication.

**General Notes:**

*   All vulnerabilities are located in third-party extensions, not the TYPO3 core.
*   The bulletin emphasizes the use of Collective Security Bulletins (CSBs) for less critical extensions.
*   The provided CVSS scores indicate the severity and potential impact of each vulnerability.
*   For most of the listed extensions, updates are available via the TYPO3 Extension Manager.
*   The JW Calendar extension was removed because the author couldn't be reached.
