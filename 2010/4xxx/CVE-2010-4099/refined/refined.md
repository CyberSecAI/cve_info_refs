Title: NitroSecurity ESM 8.4.0a - Remote Code Execution
CVE: 2010-4099
Author: Filip Palian
Type: remote
Platform: Linux
Date: 2010-10-26

Vulnerable App: NitroSecurity ESM 8.4.0a (NitroSecurity 2.6.22.19-24nssmp64 GNU/Linux)

Root cause of vulnerability:
The perl module "ess.pm" is prone to remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of user input validation. The "system()" call in "ess.pm" allows execution of arbitrary commands.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote Code Execution
- Lack of user input validation

Impact of exploitation:
Remote code execution in the context of the user running the web server.

Attack vectors:
By sending a specially crafted request to the NitroSecurity ESM web interface.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- No authentication is required.
- "ESSPMDebug=1" option must be enabled in "/usr/local/ess/CPConsoleServer.cfg".
- The attacker needs the IP address of the NitroSecurity ESM server.

Proof of Concept:
The provided HTML form demonstrates how to inject commands by manipulating the IFS (Internal Field Separator).
