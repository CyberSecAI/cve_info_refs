```
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `argv[1]` parameter in `pandora_diag.php` is not filtered, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unfiltered user input in the `argv[1]` parameter of `pandora_diag.php`.
- The vulnerability requires `register_globals` to be set to "On" to be exploitable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution by injecting arbitrary PHP code.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `pandora_diag.php` with a crafted `argv[1]` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The `register_globals` setting must be enabled on the server.
