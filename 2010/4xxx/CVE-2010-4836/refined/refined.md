  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2010-4836",
      "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities were found in PHPShop, including Insufficient Anti-automation, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and Full Path Disclosure. The Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerability was present in the user registration page (/users/register.html) due to a weak captcha, and the password recovery page (/users/sendpassword.html) lacked any protection against automated requests. The XSS vulnerability could be exploited even with the captcha bypass. A DoS vulnerability was found in the search functionality (/search/?words=.&p=all&cat=0). A Full Path Disclosure vulnerability was present when accessing a non-existing page (/page/â€™). Affected versions include PHPShop 2.1 EE and earlier (and potentially later versions).",
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerabilities stem from insufficient input validation and lack of proper security measures implemented within the PHPShop application. This includes a weak CAPTCHA, lack of anti-automation mechanisms in password recovery, improper handling of user input leading to XSS, unoptimized or unprotected search functionality causing DoS, and improper error handling leading to Full Path Disclosure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient Anti-automation",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Denial of Service (DoS)",
        "Full Path Disclosure",
		    "Weak Captcha implementation"
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to several malicious outcomes. The Insufficient Anti-automation vulnerabilities could allow automated account creation or password recovery attempts, potentially leading to unauthorized access or spam. The XSS vulnerability could be used to inject malicious scripts into the web application, allowing for user session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. The DoS vulnerability could render the website unavailable by overwhelming its resources. The Full Path Disclosure vulnerability could leak sensitive information about the server's file structure, aiding attackers in further exploitation.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Automated requests to registration and password recovery pages",
        "Maliciously crafted input to the search function",
        "Malicious script injection via a vulnerable input field",
        "Accessing non-existent pages to trigger disclosure of file paths"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable parts of the PHPShop application through a web browser or by scripting automated requests. The XSS vulnerability may require some degree of technical expertise to craft a suitable script, but does not require advanced skills. Similarly, sending crafted search requests for DoS, and invalid paths to trigger FPD are trivial attack vectors."
