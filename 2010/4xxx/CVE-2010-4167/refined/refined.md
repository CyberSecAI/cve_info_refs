**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability in ImageMagick stems from the application's behavior of reading configuration files from the current working directory. This behavior allows a local attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code by placing malicious configuration files in a directory where a victim might run ImageMagick tools.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the ImageMagick software's design flaw that includes the current working directory in the search path for configuration files. This exposes the software to malicious configuration files placed in untrusted locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Configuration File Loading:** ImageMagick reads configuration files from the current working directory, an area that can be controlled by a malicious actor.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing specially crafted configuration files in the current working directory, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The software does not adequately validate the source or contents of loaded configuration files, allowing for the inclusion of malicious instructions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable ImageMagick tool.
*   **System Compromise:** By achieving arbitrary code execution, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** A local attacker places malicious configuration files (e.g., `coder.xml`, `delegates.xml`) in a directory.
*   **User Interaction:** A user is tricked into running an ImageMagick tool (e.g., `convert`) within the directory controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to a directory where a user might execute ImageMagick tools.
*   **Social Engineering or User Deception:** The attacker needs to trick the user into running the vulnerable ImageMagick tool within the directory with the attacker's malicious configuration files.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `configure.c` file of ImageMagick versions, specifically line 722 in `ImageMagick-6.2.8.0-4.el5_5.3.src.rpm`.
*   Configuration files such as `delegates.xml` and `coder.xml` are loaded from the current working directory.
*   A fix was implemented upstream by not reading configuration files from the current directory. This was noted as being fixed in the 6.6.5-5 ChangeLog.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of ImageMagick, including those used in Debian, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*   The fix for this issue involves modifying the way ImageMagick searches for configuration files to prevent loading from the current working directory when it shouldn't.
*   Red Hat also addressed the issue with a patch that was backported to older versions of ImageMagick.
