How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1031-1: ClamAV vulnerabilities

10 December 2010

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [clamav](/security/cves?package=clamav) -

## Details

Arkadiusz Miskiewicz and others discovered that the PDF processing

code in libclamav improperly validated input. This could allow a

remote attacker to craft a PDF document that could crash clamav or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2010-4260](/security/CVE-2010-4260), [CVE-2010-4479](/security/CVE-2010-4479))

It was discovered that an off-by-one error in the icon\_cb function

in pe\_icons.c in libclamav could allow an attacker to corrupt

memory, causing clamav to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2010-4261](/security/CVE-2010-4261))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the

clamav AppArmor profile.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- clamav
clamav was updated to version 0.96.5 to fix denial of service
problems (CVE-2010-4479, CVE-2010-4260, CVE-2010-4261)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- subversion
The SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit option allowed remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2010-3315).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- python
a race condition in the accept() implementation of smtpd.py could
lead to a denial of service (CVE-2010-3493).
integer overflows and insufficient size checks could crash the
audioop module (CVE-2010-2089, CVE-2010-1634).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit that to
modify or forge messages (CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020,
CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS version 2.4.9 fixes among other things two cross-site-scripting
and a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2010-2080, CVE-2010-3476,
CVE-2010-4071).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moonlight

potentially allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-4254).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.3
- OpenOffice\_org
Specially crafted ppt files could cause a heap based buffer overflow
in OpenOffice\_org Impress. Attackers could exploit that to crash
OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936).
The update also fixes numerous non-security bugs. Please refer to
the package changelog for details.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

## CVE-2010-4260: ClamAV Multiple PDF Vulnerabilities

[with 2 comments](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/cve-2010-4260-clamav-multiple-pdf-vulnerabilities/#comments)

Continuing from [the previous bug](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/12/05/cve-2010-4261-clamav-icon_cb-off-by-one/) fixed in the 0.96.5 release of ClamAV, we have some other security bugs too. This time the buggy code can be found at libclamav/pdf.c which is the PDF parser of ClamAV.

Here are those bugs…

**find\_stream\_bounds() read/write out of bounds**

```

static int find_stream_bounds(const char *start, off_t bytesleft, off_t bytesleft2, off_t *stream, off_t *endstream)
{
    const char *q2, *q;
    if ((q2 = cli_memstr(start, bytesleft, "stream", 6))) {
        q2 += 6;
        if (q2[0] == '\xd' && q2[1] == '\xa')
            q2 += 2;
        if (q2[0] == '\xa')
            q2++;
        *stream = q2 - start;
        bytesleft2 -= q2 - start;
        if (bytesleft2 < 0)
            return 0;
        q = q2;
        q2 = cli_memstr(q, bytesleft2, "endstream", 9);
        if (!q2)
            q2 = q + bytesleft2-9; /* till EOF */
        *endstream = q2 - start;
        if (*endstream < *stream)
            *endstream = *stream;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

```

From its name you can easily understand its purpose. It uses cli\_memstr() to find the beginning of a PDF stream from the ‘bytesleft’ offset. When it finds it, it increments ‘q2’ pointer by 6 to point after “stream” and checks for “0x0D 0x0A” sequences which is just an “\r\n” line breaking sequence. If this is the case, it skips it by incrementing ‘q2’ by two and if it deals with a single ‘\n’ character it increments it by one.

Finally, it uses that value to calculate a temporary offset of the Bytes left (stored in ‘bytesleft2’) and it’s checking it for possible integer underflows because of the subtraction.

A similar approach is used for the “endstream” and the equivalent pointers are updated.

The problem here arises if a “stream” is the last thing contained in the PDF file. This means that after incrementing ‘q2’ by 6, it will point to the end of file. The subsequent operations lead to read/write out of bounds and to fix this the following patch was applied.

```

        q2 += 6;
-       if (q2[0] == '\xd' && q2[1] == '\xa')
+       bytesleft -= q2 - start;
+       if (bytesleft < 1)
+           return 0;
+       if (bytesleft >= 2 && q2[0] == '\xd' && q2[1] == '\xa')
            q2 += 2;

```

What it does is immediately updating ‘byteleft’ after hitting a “stream” to check that it hasn’t reached then end of the file.

**find\_length() NULL Pointer Dereference**

The next vulnerability resides in find\_length() which is also pretty self-explanatory.

```

static int find_length(struct pdf_struct *pdf,
                       struct pdf_obj *obj,
                       const char *start, off_t len)
{
    int length;
    const char *q;
    q = cli_memstr(start, len, "/Length", 7);
  ...
    while (isdigit(*q)) q++;
    if (*q == ' ') {
  ...
        while(isdigit(*q)) q++;
        if (q[0] == ' ' && q[1] == 'R') {
            cli_dbgmsg("cli_pdf: length is in indirect object %u %u\n", length, genid);
            obj = find_obj(pdf, obj, (length << 8) | (genid&0xff));
            if (!obj) {
                cli_dbgmsg("cli_pdf: indirect object not found\n");
                return 0;
            }
            q = pdf_nextobject(pdf->map+obj->start, pdf->size - obj->start);
            length = atoi(q);
        }
    }
  ...
    return length;
}

```

This is a NULL pointer dereference since the function that retrieves the next PDF object returns NULL if it fails to do so. The fix for this bug is:

```

            q = pdf_nextobject(pdf->map+obj->start, pdf->size - obj->start);
+           if (!q) {
+               cli_dbgmsg("cli_pdf: next object not found\n");
+               return 0;
+           }
            length = atoi(q);
        }

```

Which checks the return value of pdf\_nextobject().

**cli\_pdf() Incorrect Return Value**

Here is a code snippet…

```

int cli_pdf(const char *dir, cli_ctx *ctx, off_t offset)
{
    struct pdf_struct pdf;
    fmap_t *map = *ctx->fmap;
    size_t size = map->len - offset;
    off_t versize = size > 1032 ? 1032 : size;
    off_t map_off, bytesleft;
    long xref;
  ...
    rc = run_pdf_hooks(&pdf, PDF_PHASE_PRE, -1, -1);
    if (rc) {
        cli_dbgmsg("cli_pdf: returning %d\n", rc);
        return rc == CL_BREAK ? CL_CLEAN : rc;
  ...
    }
    cli_dbgmsg("cli_pdf: returning %d\n", rc);
    free(pdf.objs);
    return rc;
}

```

Although the correct way is to check for ‘CL\_BREAK’ which means that the operation was aborted, the routine will just return the value contained in ‘rc’ even in cases of abort. To fix this, it was patched like this:

```

     free(pdf.objs);
-    return rc;
+    /* PDF hooks may abort, don't return CL_BREAK to caller! */
+    return rc == CL_BREAK ? CL_CLEAN : rc;
 }

```

In order to return ‘CL\_CLEAN’ on such cases.

1. Nice writeup as usual. One minor correction: should be 0x0d and 0x0a, not 0xd0 and 0xa0.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Seems like two security issues:

"1) Multiple errors within the processing of PDF files can be exploited to
e.g. cause a crash.

2) An off-by-one error within the "icon_cb()" function can be exploited to
cause a memory corruption."

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
