- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a remote file inclusion flaw in the `adodb.inc.php` file, specifically due to the use of an include_once statement that takes a user-supplied parameter (`$path`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application includes a file specified by user-controlled data through the `path` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `adodb.inc.php` file, providing a URL to the malicious file as the `path` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs to host a malicious file at a location accessible via HTTP.
