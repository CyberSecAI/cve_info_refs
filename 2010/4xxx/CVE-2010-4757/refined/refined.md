- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - **XSS**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input (news item titles) when rendering them for administrative review. Specifically, double quotes and HTML tags are not sanitized.
    - **XSRF**: Lack of a sufficiently random token in the user add form. The token is derived from an MD5 hash of the admin account's creation date, which is publicly visible.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **XSS**:  The application fails to sanitize user input in the news submission feature, allowing for the injection of JavaScript.
    - **XSRF**: The application relies on a predictable token for form submissions, making it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **XSS**:  Malicious JavaScript can be executed within an administrator's browser session when they view the news approval queue, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions on the admin account.
    - **XSRF**: Attackers can potentially trick administrators into performing actions they did not intend (e.g. creating a new user).

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **XSS**: An unauthenticated attacker submits a news item with a malicious JavaScript payload in the title through the submitnews.php URL.
    - **XSRF**:  An attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., a form submission) and tricks an administrator into executing it while logged into the e107 system. The attacker is able to determine the token based on the public 'Joined' date of the admin user.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **XSS**: Unauthenticated attacker with the ability to submit news items.
    - **XSRF**: Attacker needs to know the administrative user's creation date, which is publicly available. The attacker also needs to be able to trick an administrator into clicking a link to execute the forged request.
