### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- java-1\_6\_0-ibm
IBM Java 6 SR9 FP1 was updated to fix a critical security bug in float
number handling.
CVE-2010-4476: The Java Runtime Environment hangs forever when converting
"2.2250738585072012e-308" to a binary floating-point number.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP4
- java-1\_5\_0-ibm
IBM Java 5 was updated to SR 12 FP 4 fixing various security issues.
For more details, please check the IBM JDK Alerts page:
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/alerts/>
Following CVE entries are referenced by this update:
CVE-2010-4447, CVE-2010-4448, CVE-2010-4450, CVE-2010-4454, CVE-2010-4462,
CVE-2010-4465, CVE-2010-4466, CVE-2010-4468, CVE-2010-4471, CVE-2010-4473,
CVE-2010-4475
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 SR13 was updated to FP8 to fix various bugs and security
issues.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-1321: The kg\_accept\_krb5 function in krb5/accept\_sec\_context.c
in the GSS-API library in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.7.1 and 1.8
before 1.8.2, as used in kadmind and other applications, does not properly
check for invalid GSS-API tokens, which allows remote authenticated users to
cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an
AP-REQ message in which the authenticator's checksum field is missing.
- CVE-2010-3574: Unspecified vulnerability in the Networking component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, 1.4.2\_27,
and 1.3.1\_28 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the October 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from
a reliable downstream vendor that HttpURLConnection does not properly check
for the allowHttpTrace permission, which allows untrusted code to perform
HTTP TRACE requests.
- CVE-2010-4476: The Java Runtime Environment hangs forever when converting
"2.2250738585072012e-308" to a binary floating-point number.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP4
- postfix
postfix did not clear the receive buffer after the STARTTLS command.
A man-in-the middle could therefore inject commands in the unencrypted
stream that get interpreted in the encrypted phase after STARTTLS
(CVE-2011-0411).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- dhcp6
A rogue dhcp server could instruct clients to use a host name that
contains shell meta characters. Since many scripts in the system do
not expect unusal characters in the system's host name the dhcp
client needs to sanitize the host name offered by the server
(CVE-2011-0997).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- dhcpcd
This update fixes the following security issue:
A rogue DHCP server could instruct clients to use a host name that
contains shell meta characters. Since many scripts in the system do
not expect unusal characters in the system's host name the DHCP
client needs to sanitize the host name offered by the server
(CVE-2011-0996).
Note this update is actually just a re-release of the previous one.
The security fix made dhcpcd crash if the DHCP server sent a SIP
option that was not decodable. This update also allows spaces in the
domain name option again as some DHCP servers abuse the option as
DNS search list.
This update also fixes the following non-security issues:
- 564441: e1000 and dhcpd hickup
- 579438: endless loop after adding wlan usb stick (with dhcp ip lease
time infinity)
- 654649: dhcpcd ignores -G (--nogateway) option and sets default route
- 657402: dhcpcd sends RENEWAL as ethernet broadcast instead of unicast
- 668194: dhcp client not working properly in Xen domU due to partial
checksum offload
- 672038: dhcpcd sends RENEWAL as ethernet broadcast instead of unicast
- mono-addon-bytefx-data-mysql/bytefx-data-mysql
Mono had loaded shared libraries from the current directory (CVE-2010-4159)
and was also vunerable to a padding oracle attack (CVE-2010-3332)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- dbus-1
Local users could crash the D-Bus daemon by sending a specially crafted
message (CVE-2010-4352). This update also properly fixes CVE-2008-3834
and CVE-2009-1189.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- libtiff/libtiff-devel
Specially crafted tiff files could cause a heap-based buffer overflow
in the thunder-decoder (CVE-2011-1167).
Directories with a large number of files could cause an integer
overflow in the tiffdump tool (CVE-2010-4665)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- cifs-mount/libnetapi-devel
With this update samba is not prone to a remote denial of service
attack anymore. (CVE-2011-0719)
Additionally this update also fixes the following reliability bugs:
- leaving childs in "zombie" state
- adding new printers without restart
- GSSAPI lock AD user account
- printer drivers from Windows 64-bit failing
- MIGRATE PRINTERS failing on 64-bit
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE10-SP4, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- rubygem-sqlite3
The package contained some world-writable files. Local users could
exploit that to inject arbitrary code into programs using rubygem-sqlite3
(CVE-2011-0995).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1
- gnutls
The SSL-renegotiation "authentication gap" has been fixed in GnuTLS.
(CVE-2009-3555)
Also an integer size issue was fixed which lead to incorrectly accepted
certificates.
Affected Products: SLES9
- libpolkit0
A race condition exists in pkexec while trying to
determine its caller which could lead to privilege escalation.
CVE-2011-1485 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4
- udisks
This update of udisks improves input validation. Before it was possible
to load arbitrary LKMs. (CVE-2010-4661: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.6)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=664082#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-17 23:36:20 UTC  ``` Sebastian Krahmer reported that the udisks service (via D-BUS) could be used to load arbitrary Linux kernel modules.  Since "mount -t $NAME" is called, this also triggers a "modprobe -q -- $NAME" which will load the Linux kernel module from /lib/modules/.  The upstream bug report is: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32232> and no upstream fix has been made as of yet, although the upstream bug report has a few suggestions on how to correct this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=664082#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-01-31 19:21:20 UTC  ``` This issue can only be exploited by users who are logged in locally and in an active session.  Attempting the same via remote (i.e. via ssh) fails with:  Error org.freedesktop.UDisks.Error.PermissionDenied: Not Authorized   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=664082#c7)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-02-23 08:16:02 UTC  ``` <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q1/252>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=664082#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-23 17:41:54 UTC  ``` This has been assigned the name [CVE-2010-4661](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4661)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=664082#c9)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-23 17:43:11 UTC  ``` Created udisks tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 679859](show_bug.cgi?id=679859 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2010-4661 udisks: arbitrary Linux kernel loading flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=664082#c10)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-23 17:45:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.  This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=664082#c11)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-16 18:05:14 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/udisks/commit/?id=c933a929f07421ec747cebb24d5e620fc2b97037>  And fixed in upstream 1.0.3.  Current Fedora releases have 1.0.4 so they have been addressed.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=664082#c12)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-11 21:04:22 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2010-4661>   ``` |  |
