  "cveId": "CVE-2010-4653",
  "description": "An integer overflow condition in poppler before 0.16.3 can occur when parsing CharCodes for fonts.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Integer overflow during CharCode parsing in fonts due to insufficient validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Unchecked memory allocation return value",
		"NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file.",
      "attackVector": "Network. The vulnerability is triggered by opening a maliciously crafted PDF file.",
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to create a PDF file with a malformed CharCode that triggers the overflow.",
      "details": "The vulnerability lies in how Poppler parses CharCodes for fonts. An integer overflow occurs during the parsing process, specifically in the `CharCodeToUnicode::addMapping` function, when handling specially crafted CharCodes (e.g., negative values). This overflow leads to an allocation size of 0, which causes a NULL pointer dereference when memory is accessed. The vulnerability can be triggered by various malformed CharCodes, especially if `nBits` is 8, codes like `<-1>` to `<-f>` can lead to the vulnerability. If `nBits` is 16, codes like `<-001>` to `<-fff>` can cause an issue, although codes greater than `<-0ff>` will be detected by an overflow check elsewhere and will lead to program abortion."
