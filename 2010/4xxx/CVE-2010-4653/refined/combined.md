## Notes

---

### [jdstrand](https://launchpad.net/~jdstrand)

xpdf in koffice is 2.0
poppler patch on 10.04 and 10.10 does not have GooLikely.h
so will need to add inline to poppler/CharCodeToUnicode.cc

---

### [sbeattie](https://launchpad.net/~sbeattie)

libextractor and ipe do not contain vulnerable code,
at least as of precise.

# Poppler: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201310-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Poppler, some of which
may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/poppler** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.22.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.22.2-r1** |

### Background

Poppler is a cross-platform PDF rendering library originally based on
Xpdf.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Poppler. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF
file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.22.2-r1"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-01-24 10:31:37 UTC  ``` 1. Due to an integer overflow when parsing CharCodes for fonts and a failure to check the return value of a memory allocation, it is possible to trigger writes to a narrow range of offsets from a NULL pointer.  The chance of being able to exploit this for anything other than a crash is very remote: on x86 32-bit, there's no chance (since the write occurs between 0xffffffc4 and 0xfffffffc).  At least the write lands in valid userspace on x86-64, but in my testing this memory is never mapped.  Fixed in poppler commit at [1], hopefully fixed soon at xpdf upstream.  2. Malformed commands may cause corruption of the internal stack used to maintain graphics contexts, leading to potentially exploitable memory corruption.  Fixed in poppler commit at [2], hopefully fixed soon at xpdf upstream.  -Dan  [1] <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=cad66a7d25abdb6aa15f3aa94a35737b119b2659> [2] <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=8284008aa8230a92ba08d547864353d3290e9bf9> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Maciej Mrozowski   gentoo-dev  2011-01-24 18:04:41 UTC  ``` This is already fixed in >=app-text/poppler-0.14.5. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-01-26 00:23:06 UTC  ``` Stabilization taking place in [bug 349887](show_bug.cgi?id=349887 "RESOLVED FIXED - =app-text/poppler-0.14.5 stabilization request"). ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-02-19 15:31:41 UTC  ``` Stabilization completed.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=672165#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-24 09:39:48 UTC  ``` Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in xpdf/poppler code base:    <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/4109>    Due to an integer overflow when parsing CharCodes for fonts and a   failure to check the return value of a memory allocation, it is   possible to trigger writes to a narrow range of offsets from a NULL   pointer.  The chance of being able to exploit this for anything other   than a crash is very remote: on x86 32-bit, there's no chance (since   the write occurs between 0xffffffc4 and 0xfffffffc).  At least the   write lands in valid userspace on x86-64, but in my testing this   memory is never mapped.  poppler git commit that addresses integer overflow issue: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=cad66a7d25abdb6aa15f3aa94a35737b119b2659>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=672165#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-24 10:16:11 UTC  ``` Affected code can be reached via GfxFont::readToUnicodeCMap function, which is called both from Gfx8BitFont and GfxCIDFont with different nBits values (8 and 16 respectively).  This further calls CharCodeToUnicode::parseCMap1, which reads character codes from the file.  Expected character code format is either "<XX>" or "<XXXX>" depending on the nBits value, where X is hexadecimal number.  The code value is read using sscanf("%x"), so '-' character is recognized too.  parseCMap1 code ensures there are exactly 2 or 4 digits.  Reproducer triggering this flaw used char code as "<-1>".  This negative value is stored in the unsigned int code variable as high positive value that wraps to 0 when the following computation is performed in addMapping:    mapLen = (code + 256) & ~255;  Subsequent greallocn call returns NULL as requested nObjs == 0.  Unchecked return value cause addMapping to perform a NULL pointer deference.  For 8 bit codes, this results in an access to limited address range mentioned in the Dan's report (as code triggering the issue are in the range "<-1>" .. "<-f>").  For nBits == 16, problematic codes are "<-001>" .. "<-fff>".  Only the code "<-001>" .. "<-0ff>" trigger integer overflow.  Remaining values do not pass an integer overflow check in greallocn, which results in the program abort.  Referenced poppler fix does not change the code to handle this error condition more gracefully.   ``` |  |
