```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `nav.html` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Remote HTML Inclusion (RHI) vulnerabilities.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser (XSS) or include arbitrary HTML content from a remote server (RHI).
- Attack vectors:
    - XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript into the `nav.html` parameter, e.g., `http://site/nav.html?javascript:alert(document.cookie)`.
    - RHI: By including remote HTML content using the `nav.html` parameter, e.g., `http://site/nav.html?http://websecurity.com.ua`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can be remote. They need to be able to craft URLs to the vulnerable application.
