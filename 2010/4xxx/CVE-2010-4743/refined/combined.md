How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,
the following was reported to the oss-security mailing list:

  Abcm2ps upstream has released:
    [1] <http://moinejf.free.fr/>
    [2] <http://moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-5.9.12.tar.gz>

  latest v5.9.12 version, addressing
  "some security vulnerabilities"
    [3] <http://moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-5.txt>

  References:
    [4] <http://secunia.com/advisories/39345/>

This doesn't warrant a DSA, but it would be nice if you would fix this
through a point update.

Cheers,
        Moritz

thanks

Dear maintainer,

I've prepared an NMU for abcm2ps (versioned as 5.9.13-0.1) and
uploaded it to DELAYED/15, as it introduces a new upstream version.
Please note, that I picked 5.9.13 instead of 5.9.12 as reported by
Moritz, as 5.9.13 is to "Fix more security vulnerabilities".

Best regards,
  Alexander

PS:  debscripts nmudiff shows all changes between the versions, however
my changes are just to copy your debian directory and adding a changelog
entry.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

lenny (5.0.9)
squeeze (6.0.1)

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help or lack time. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

2: <http://deb.li/prsc>

Thanks,

with his security hat on:
