Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4774:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `pfd.php` file of AuraCMS version 1.62.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in `pfd.php`, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially read arbitrary data from the database, including sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, and other confidential content.
- It could lead to data modification, insertion, or deletion within the database.
- Could lead to full compromise of the application/server

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a web request, specifically through the vulnerable `pfd.php` file with a crafted `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or specific network position is needed.
- Basic knowledge of SQL Injection is required to craft the malicious SQL code.

**Exploit details:**
The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is:
`http://localhost/pdf.php?id=140+AND+1=2+UNION+SELECT+ind0nesianc0der,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`
This exploit attempts to inject a SQL query that will return the string `ind0nesianc0der` along with a series of numbers, likely for verifying the injection and understanding the database schema.

The exploit leverages a standard SQL injection technique with a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data, demonstrating the vulnerability.
