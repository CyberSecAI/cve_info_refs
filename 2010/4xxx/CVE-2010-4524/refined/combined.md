| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=664718#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-21 13:13:16 UTC  ``` MHonArc, a Perl mail-to-HTML converter, failed to properly escape certain HTML sequences. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted email message and trick the local user to convert it into HTML format.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached patch is a quick way to fix it. It increases the processing time
(it has to run filter() at least twice per message,) but ensures that no
undesired html is returned (unless one of the existing routines misses
something.)

What do you think about it?

Based on discussion with Earl so far, I think the correct fix is disabling
HTML mail support by default.

After extensive discussion, upstream is preparing a new release of mhonarc
(the security and related bug fixes are more extensive than the patch
supplied to Debian). I prefer to ship the new release as the security
update, rather than attempt a backport. Happy to discuss if security team
has any concerns.

I hate HTML in mail.

I should note that MHonArc documentation warns about HTML mail,
and the recommendation is to disable support of it:

  <http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/faq/security.html#htmldata>

With that said, do have an available patch that fixes
the problem?

If not, I can look into it during the holiday break to
get a fix for it.  Note, even if there is a fix for the
case you provided, there is no 100% guarantee that there
could be other data input sequences that get by the filter.
Hence, those concerned about security disable the
HTML filter:

Subject: CVE Request -- MHonArc: Improper escaping of certain HTML sequences
 (XSS)

Hello Steve, vendors,

   MHonArc, a Perl mail-to-HTML converter, failed to
properly escape certain HTML sequences. A remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted email
message and trick the local user to convert it
into HTML format. Subsequent preview of such
message might potentially execute arbitrary HTML
or scripting code (XSS).

[1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=607693>
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664718>

Public PoC:
[3] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=5;filename=elsatest.mbox;att=1;bug=607693>

Further issue note:
-------------------
MHonArc properly escapes for example:

<script>alert("elsa");</script> =>

&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;elsa&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;

But fails to do the same example for a string in the form of:

<scr<body>ipt>alert("elsa");</scr<body>ipt> =>

<script>alert("elsa");</script>

Affected versions: Issue confirmed in latest MHonArc-2.6.16 version

Could you allocate a CVE id for this issue?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
