    *   **Attack Vector:** Network based, through the vulnerable extension.
     *   **Required Capabilities:** No authentication required.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices within the third-party extensions, such as lack of input sanitization which lead to SQL injection, and unfiltered output which leads to XSS.

**Recommendations:**

*   Update the vulnerable extensions to the latest versions.
*   If no update is available, uninstall the vulnerable extension, like in the case of 'jw_calendar'.
*   Follow the recommendations in the TYPO3 Security Cookbook.
*   Subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list for security updates.
