Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4954:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an error-based SQL injection in the `reviews.php` or `product_reviews_info.php` file of xt:Commerce Gambio.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `products_id` parameter in `product_reviews_info.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database, gain access to sensitive information, or even gain full control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to the vulnerable `product_reviews_info.php` page, where the `products_id` parameter contains SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker requires remote access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter and the structure of the SQL query in order to inject the malicious code successfully.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit example provided uses a single quote (') to trigger an SQL error, revealing the structure of the query.
*   The vulnerable code is located within the `xtc_db_error` function.
*   The provided example is `http://server/product_reviews_info.php?products_id=4'`, which causes the error message: `xtc_db_error ("select manufacturers_id from products where products_id = 4/'", "1064"`. This shows the SQL query is susceptible to injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit is verified.
*   The affected software is xt:Commerce Gambio 2008, 2010, and possibly all versions.
*   The exploit was tested on XP/Linux.
*   The vulnerability was not fixed when the exploit was published.
*   The advisory provides dorks to find vulnerable installations: `Gambio inurl:"reviews.php" / Gambio inurl:"product_reviews.php?products_id="`.
