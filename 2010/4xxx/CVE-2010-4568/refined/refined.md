  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2010-4568",
      "description": "It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short enough that the attack is highly effective). This is a critical vulnerability that should be patched immediately by all Bugzilla installations.",
        "affected_versions": "2.14 to 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1",
        "fixed_versions": "3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of `rand` and `srand` functions in Perl, which are based on `srand48` and `drand48` on Linux, seeded with only 32 bits of entropy. This makes the random number generation predictable.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Weak source of randomness leading to predictable password reset tokens."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can recover a password reset token for any account and change the password, gaining unauthorized access to the victim's account.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Requesting a password reset for a victim's account while being logged into Bugzilla.",
	 "Brute-forcing the password reset token based on the attacker's login cookie."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "An attacker needs a valid account on the Bugzilla system."
        ,"Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server."
	, "Ability to execute arbitrary Perl code to find the seed and calculate the next tokens."
