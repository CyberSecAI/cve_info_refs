Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it's used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` and `email` parameters from both POST and GET requests are directly inserted into an SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is due to the direct concatenation of user-supplied input into the SQL query. The vulnerability is present in the `contact.php` script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL query execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameters, which allows them to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to:
    - Data breaches (accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data)
    - Compromising the entire application
    - Potential server compromise depending on database access and configuration

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET requests:** The `id` and `email` parameters are vulnerable when provided in a GET request (via the URL).
- **HTTP POST requests:**  The `id` and `email` parameters are also vulnerable when provided in a POST request (via form data).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `contact.php` script.
- The attacker doesn't require any specific privileges or access to exploit this vulnerability.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection queries

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet from `contact.php` highlights the lack of sanitization:
```php
$email = $_POST["email"];
$id = $_POST["id"];
if (!$id) {
    $id = $_GET[id];
}
if (!$email) {
    $email = $_GET[email];
}
$result=mysql_query("SELECT * FROM messages WHERE uid = \"$id\" AND email = \"$email\"");
```
-  The proof-of-concept (PoC) examples demonstrate how to inject SQL code using union selects. Example:
    -  `http://website.com/contact.php?id=-1' union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10/*`
    -  `http://website.com/contact.php?email=-1' union select 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1/*`
-  The vulnerability is present in FreeTicket version 1.0.0.
-  It is noted that `magic_quotes_gpc` must be off for the exploit to work.

This vulnerability is classified as **Medium** severity according to the provided information.
