Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the Netvolution CMS application, specifically in how it handles the `pid` parameter within the `default.asp` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized and is used directly within a SQL query. This allows attackers to manipulate the query structure and extract sensitive information.
*   **Error-Based SQL Injection:** The exploit leverages error-based SQL injection. By injecting SQL code that causes a type conversion error (e.g., converting the result of `db_name(1)` to an integer), the application reveals the result in the error message.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `pid` parameter in the `default.asp` page, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as:
    *   Database names
    *   Table names
    *   Column names
    *   User credentials (usernames and passwords) from the `cms_Users` table
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (with Metasploit integration):** The exploit script demonstrates the ability to upload a web backdoor, leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Potential for Full System Compromise:** By exploiting the RCE and other findings, an attacker can compromise the server and the underlying database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP GET requests, where malicious SQL code is embedded within the `pid` parameter of the URL.
*   **Automated Scanning:** The provided script offers automated scanning to identify vulnerable sites.
*   **Manual Exploitation:** The script allows for manual SQL injection exploitation, targeting specific tables and columns.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server to send HTTP requests.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker requires some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft injection payloads.
*   **Metasploit Framework (Optional):**  The exploit script demonstrates compatibility with the Metasploit Framework for advanced exploitation, but is not strictly necessary for exploiting the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The script leverages a feature of the CMS to upload a web shell. This indicates the attacker also needs to understand or have access to this functionality within the CMS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit script is written in Perl and provides a menu-driven interface.
*   It includes functionality to scan a list of sites for vulnerability, extract database information, retrieve user credentials, perform manual exploitation, and integrate with the Metasploit Framework.
*   The script leverages `LWP::UserAgent` module to send HTTP requests.
*   It uses specific SQL queries within the `convert` function to expose data through error messages.
*   The script automates the extraction of databases, tables, columns, and user credentials.
*   The Metasploit integration includes functions for uploading an executable, and setting up a handler.

This exploit provides significant details for exploiting this specific vulnerability.
