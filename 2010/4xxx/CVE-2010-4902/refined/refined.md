  "CVE-2010-4902": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Joomla Component Clantools version 1.2.3 is vulnerable to multiple blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
    "details": [
      {
        "vulnerability": "Blind SQL Injection",
         "locations": [
            "http://www.site.com/joomlapath/index.php?option=com_clantools&squad=1+[Blind SQL]",
            "http://www.site.com/joomlapath/index.php?option=com_clantools&task=clanwar&showgame=1+[Blind SQL]&Itemid=999"
         ],
        "attack_vector": "By injecting malicious SQL code via the 'squad' or 'showgame' parameters in the URL",
        "impact": "An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application. The injection is blind, meaning the attacker cannot see the results directly but can infer based on time delays or other responses.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied parameters.",
          "Lack of parameterized queries, allowing direct insertion of SQL commands"
        ],
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable URLs with modified parameters. No special privileges are needed."
