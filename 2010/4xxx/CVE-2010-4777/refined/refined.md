{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An assertion failure in Perl's regular expression engine due to incorrect handling of subpatterns with specific input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Assertion failure in regular expression processing",
       "Potential for application crashes due to the assertion failure"
    ],
    "impact": "The assertion failure could lead to application crashes. This specifically affected applications using Perl's regex engine, such as SpamAssassin and OCSInventory.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted input with specific regular expressions"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide specific input to a Perl application that utilizes regular expressions and triggers the vulnerable code path.",
     "details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `Perl_reg_numbered_buff_fetch` function within Perl's regular expression engine. An assertion `rx->sublen >= (s - rx->subbeg) + i` fails when processing specific regular expressions and input. The issue is related to how Perl handles subpatterns and their offsets during regex matching."
