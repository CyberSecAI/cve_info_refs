Based on the provided exploit-db content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw in the `eCal` module of E-Xoopport Samsara version 3.1 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `lid` parameter of the `/modules/eCal/location.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code. Because it is blind SQL injection, the attacker cannot directly see the output of their queries, they must infer the results by observing application behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (usernames and passwords). The provided exploit demonstrates how to retrieve a user's password using the `substring` and `ascii` functions to extract the password character by character.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With access to user credentials, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the application and potentially perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `/modules/eCal/location.php` script.
- **SQL Injection:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `lid` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable E-Xoopport Samsara application.
- **Authentication:**  The attacker needs valid login credentials to access the `eCal` module, or at least be able to gain access to the module. The provided exploit logs in using provided credentials, and then tests for access to `/modules/eCal/location.php`.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques, specifically blind SQL injection, to craft the malicious queries to extract data.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code uses Perl and `LWP::UserAgent` module to automate the attack.
- The exploit works by injecting SQL queries using boolean logic to test character by character the password of a specific user.
- The exploit script first logs in to the application and checks permissions to access the eCal module to ensure that it is vulnerable, then proceeds to perform the SQL injection.
