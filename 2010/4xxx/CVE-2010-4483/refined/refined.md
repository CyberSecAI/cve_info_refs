  "cve_id": "CVE-2010-4483",
  "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the implementation of HTML5 in Google Chrome browser versions 8.0.552.210 and earlier, Opera browser versions 10.62 and earlier, and Safari browser versions 4.1.2 and earlier, Safari browser versions 5.0.2 and earlier, and Safari browser on iOS 4.1 and earlier. Specifically, as the W3C describes in the HTML5 specification for security with canvas elements, information leakage can occur if scripts from one origin can access information from another origin. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain private information.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the origin of canvas elements when processing HTML5 content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-origin information leakage due to inadequate enforcement of security policies for HTML5 canvas elements."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could obtain private information from a network resource. The attacker could then potentially use the leaked information to further compromise the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack can be performed by hosting a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability.",
        "Compromised web sites and web sites accepting/hosting user provided content or advertisements can be used to deliver the malicious content."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have the IP address of the target resource.",
        "The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious web page."
    ]
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Google Chrome version 8.0.552.210 and earlier",
    "Opera version 10.62 and earlier",
    "Safari version 4.1.2 and earlier",
    "Safari version 5.0.2 and earlier",
    "Safari on iOS version 4.1 and earlier"
  ],
  "solution": "Apply the vendor-supplied updates or upgrade to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability. Google Chrome version 8.0.552.215, Opera version 10.63, Safari version 4.1.3, and Safari version 5.0.3 are not affected by this vulnerability."
