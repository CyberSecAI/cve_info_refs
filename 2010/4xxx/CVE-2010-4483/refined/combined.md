Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable, Beta Channel Updates](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2010/12/stable-beta-channel-updates.html "Stable, Beta Channel Updates")

Thursday, December 2, 2010

The Chrome team is happy to announce our latest Stable release, 8.0.552.215.  In addition to the over 800 bug fixes and stability improvements, Chrome 8 now contains a built in PDF viewer that is secured in Chrome’s sandbox.  As always, it also contains our latest security fixes, listed below.  This release will also be posted to the Beta Channel.

Security fixes and rewards:

Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

We would like to offer special thanks -- and a number of rewards -- to Aki Helin of OUSPG for his extensive help with the new PDF feature. We’d also like to extend thanks to Sergey Glazunov and Marc Schoenefeld for finding bugs during the development cycle such that they never reached a stable build.

Full details about the changes are available in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=62249:58656&mode=html). If you find new issues, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry). Want to change to another Chrome release channel?

## HTML5 Implementation in Chrome, Opera, and Safari Could Allow Information Disclosure

Published: April 19, 2011 | Updated: May 17, 2011

**Version:** 2.0

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of a vulnerability affecting Google Chrome browser versions 8.0.552.210 and earlier; Opera browser versions 10.62 and earlier; and Safari browser versions 4.1.2 and earlier, Safari browser versions 5.0.2 and earlier, and Safari browser on iOS 4.1 and earlier. Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the respective affected vendors, Google Inc., Opera Software ASA, and Apple Inc. Google Inc., Opera Software ASA, and Apple Inc. have remediated the vulnerability in their respective software.

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the implementation of HTML5 in these Web browsers. Specifically, as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) describes in the HTML5 specification for security with canvas elements, information leakage can occur if scripts from one origin can access information from another origin. For more information, see [HTML5: A vocabulary and associated APIs for HTML and XHTML](https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-canvas-element.html), "Security with canvas elements." An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain private information. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but the attacker could use the information gained to try to further compromise the affected system.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with Google Inc., Opera Software ASA, and Apple Inc. to ensure remediation of this issue. The vulnerability in Google Chrome has been assigned the entry, CVE-2010-4483, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information, including information about updates from Google, see [Google Chrome Releases: Stable, Beta Channel Updates](https://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/12/stable-beta-channel-updates.html) (December 2, 2010). The vulnerability in Opera has been assigned the entry, CVE-2010-4046, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information, including information about updates from Opera Software ASA, see [Advisory: Private video streams can be intercepted](https://www.opera.com/support/kb/view/974/). The vulnerability in Safari has been assigned the entry, CVE-2010-3259, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information, including information about updates from Apple, see [Apple Security Updates](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht1222).

#### Mitigating Factors

* In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must possess the IP address of the network resource that contains the private information.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of this advisory?**

This advisory is part of a coordinated release with affected vendors to inform customers of a security issue that may affect their systems.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

No. This vulnerability has been fixed via an update from the affected third-party vendors. The update remediates the software listed in the table, **Affected Software**.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to obtain private information.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When browsing certain Web sites, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari may not validate the origin of specific canvas elements. An attacker in possession of the IP address of a network resource could exploit the vulnerability to obtain private information stored on the network resource.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain private information on a network resource. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but the attacker could use the information gained to try to further compromise the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to visit the Web site. This could also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
