  "CVE-2010-4179": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided Management Console Installation Guide instructed administrators to explicitly configure 'QUEUE_ALL_TRUSTED_USERS=True' which allowed the management console (cumin) to facilitate submissions on behalf of a user. This configuration facilitated a trust relationship between cumin and the condor-qmf plugins. However, there was inadequate access control for securing the trusted channel; anyone able to publish to a broker could submit jobs.  As well, this meant that a user could submit a job to run as any other user other than root.",
    "details": [
      {
        "vulnerability": "Inadequate access control for securing the trusted channel. The 'QUEUE_ALL_TRUSTED_USERS=True' configuration facilitated a trust relationship between cumin and the condor-qmf plugins, but lacked access control.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Anyone able to publish to a broker could submit jobs.",
          "A user could submit a job to run as any other user other than root."
        ],
        "impact": "A user could submit a job to run as any other user other than root (Condor does not run jobs as root).",
        "capabilities": "Ability to publish to a broker.",
           "root_cause": "The root cause is the insecure configuration of 'QUEUE_ALL_TRUSTED_USERS=True' and the lack of access control on the condor-qmf plugins."
