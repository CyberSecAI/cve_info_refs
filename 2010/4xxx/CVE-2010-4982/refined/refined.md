Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-4982

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the My Kazaam Address & Contact Organizer application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically the `var1` parameter in `contacts.php` is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
    *   Data Breach: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Data Manipulation: Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    *   Privilege Escalation: In some cases, potentially gaining control over the database server itself.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface, specifically by crafting a malicious SQL query in the `var1` parameter of the `contacts.php` file.
*   The specific vulnerable URL is `http://127.0.0.1/[path]/address_book/contacts.php?var1=[SQLi]` where `[SQLi]` is the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the web application.
*   The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `var1` parameter in the `contacts.php` file.
*   The attacker needs to craft a valid SQL injection payload.
