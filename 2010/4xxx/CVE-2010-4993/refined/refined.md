Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw present in the Joomla! Component eventCal version 1.6.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The component is vulnerable to SQL injection. The term "blind" indicates that the attacker might not receive direct output from the database, requiring techniques to infer information through the application's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:** An attacker could modify or corrupt data within the database.
*   **Partial Availability Impact:** An attacker might be able to disrupt the availability of the application or database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the application. The vulnerable parameter is `Itemid` within the `com_eventcal` component.
    * Example: `http://127.0.0.1/path/index.php?option=com_eventcal&Itemid=[BLIND SQL-i]`
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
*   **Understanding of Blind SQLi:** The attacker needs knowledge of blind SQL injection techniques to exploit this vulnerability since direct error messages or data output is not provided by the application.
