  "CVE-2010-4527": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2010-4527",
      "Description": "The load_mixer_volumes() function, which can be triggered by unprivileged users via the SOUND_MIXER_SETLEVELS ioctl, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Because the provided 'name' argument isn't guaranteed to be NULL terminated at the expected 32 bytes, it's possible to overflow past the end of the last element in the mixer_vols array. Further exploitation can result in an arbitrary kernel write (via subsequent calls to load_mixer_volumes()) leading to privilege escalation, or arbitrary kernel reads via get_mixer_levels(). In addition, the strcmp() may leak bytes beyond the mixer_vols array."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The `load_mixer_volumes` function in the Linux kernel's OSS sound subsystem does not properly validate the length of the 'name' argument passed to it, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds read (possible with strcmp)"
      ],
       "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user can trigger a buffer overflow, leading to: arbitrary kernel write (resulting in privilege escalation) or arbitrary kernel reads. Additionally, `strcmp()` could leak bytes beyond the `mixer_vols` array.",
      "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered via the `SOUND_MIXER_SETLEVELS` ioctl, which can be called by unprivileged users.",
      "Required capabilities": "Local access to a device file normally restricted to users in group audio.",
        "Details": "The `load_mixer_volumes()` function in `sound/oss/soundcard.c` iterates through the `mixer_vols[]` array using `strcmp()` to find a requested name. There is no check to ensure that the provided name is 32 bytes or less. This could lead to an out-of-bounds read. Also the subsequent call to `strcpy()` lacks the same length checks, leading to a possible kernel stack buffer overflow if a user provides a name larger than 32 bytes. The `set_mixer_levels()` function acts as a wrapper around `load_mixer_volumes()`."
