Package: offlineimap
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

offlineimap performs absolutely no ssl certificate checking. So users could/can be the victim of a man in the middle attack.
In debian the following bugs exist:

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=536421> (re certificate expiration)
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=153240> (re ssl fingerprint checking)

This could be considered a bug in imaplib (<http://bugs.python.org/issue10274>).
A partial 'fix' is the following(this 'fix' isn't complete and would break connections to servers using self-signed certificates):

WARNING XXX: I haven't tested this 'fix' at all and so it is most likely wrong.

Although, this isn't complete because it will break self-signed certificate using servers and <http://bugs.python.org/issue1589> means that it won't provide full protection etc.
Really, what is required is that by default the certificate is checked and perhaps an option is added to bypass the check.

This isn't a new discovery, see [1], but the package provides no warning about this fact. I added a warning too <https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki/> perhaps debian can add a warning (in the package description) until this is fixed.

Here have a patch!
This obviously will break connecting to hosts which use a self-signed
certificate.
Perhaps some one else can fix this when they want it fixed ;) ?
I tested using the following config:

# Sample minimal config file.  Copy this to ~/.offlineimaprc and edit to
# suit to get started fast.

[general]
accounts = Test

[Account Test]
localrepository = Local
remoterepository = Remote

[Repository Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/Test

[Repository Remote]
type = IMAP
ssl = yes
remotehost = imap.gmail.com # this should work
#remotehost = 74.125.39.109 # this should fail
#remotehost = $putselfsignedserveraddresshere #this should fail
remoteuser = jgoerzen

For these hosts (listed here) the expected outcome matched the actual
outcome when I tried offlineimap.

```

But that looks kind of ugly, having a hardcoded path... Also, I wonder
if not self.certfile should be used for verification?

```
Hi release manager,

#603450 is a bug (currently with severity grave, Justification: user
security hole), as offlineimap does no ssl certificate checking.

While I agree, that this is a really important feature, which should be
fixed, I'm wondering, if that really is release critical.

There's patch floating arround, which has a major regression: It doesn't
work for users of self signed certificates.  Should this bug be seen as
of release critical severity, would you therefore at least consider
tagging it squeeze-ignore?

Best Regards,
  Alexander

Looking over the list of release critical bugs, I stumbled over the
package offlineimap, which currently has one release critical bug open
(and therefore risks of being removed from the release,
http:/bugs.debian.org/603450 for details).

I'm just wondering, if you are still interested in maintain this
package, and if you could help prepare a fix for this bug in time.  It
would be a shame, if we couldn't ship offlineimape any more :(

  Alexander

Sorry?
Um. Well sure a hard coded path path not be the best thing ... if you
know how to determine the path to the ca store on a system modify the
patch to use that I guess.

Sorry, that was complete nonsense.  For a moment I thought one could use
the certfile parameter to specify a file holding certs for verification.

I take my question back.  Sorry for the noise.

Could you explain why it should be acceptable to announce secure
operation but ignore the very basic principles of it? #564690 is an old
example of the same problem.

From what I've seen in the bug, even you should be able to fix that.

So is #547092 (which has severity important).  And I'm sure if we dig
deep enough, we can find others as well.

Could you explain how an example of a bug with a severity set by
yourself supports your point, considering that the maintainer of this
package only agreed about the bugs severity because it was a regression?

FWIW: As an offlineimap user I'd be very unhappy if it stopped
working with my IMAP server with its self-signed certificate.

Folks, no matter what the technical disagreement (if any) is, please try
hard(er) to refrain from this kind of ad hominem comments.

Any potential Debian contributor seeing a comment like this one, will
probably think twice before chiming in and help out in this or any other
bug, because they will for sure have better things to do in life than
risking of being annoyed this way when working as volunteers.

People don't need to be friends to work together in Debian, but acting
as enemies surely get in the way of efficient technical collaboration.

Thanks for considering,
Cheers.

Date: Mon, 13 Dec 2010 18:35:29 -0600
```
Was just pointed to this bug. The fix would probably work, however only
under python >= 2.6. ssl_wrapper calls ssl.wrap() under 2.6, but socket.ssl()
under Python 2.4 and 2.5.

And socket.ssl does not take these parameters:
cert_reqs=..., ca_certs=...

So either we have to give up python 2.5 compatability and require 2.6
for SSL connections, or do more work to work on python 2.4

If we specify a cacertfile= setting in the Repository section of an IMAP
server,
validate it on python>=2.6 or fail with python<=2.5.
The hostname check should propbably be made optional.

This should make debian happy.

This is a big patch for inspection and review (sorry didn't try to break
it up yet). It implements SSL Certificate checking so taht Debian does
not pull us out. Cert checking gets enabled when the user specifies
sslcacert=path/to/file in the Repository section of offlineimaprc. It
also checks that the hostname of the certificate matches the connection
host name.

If the user specifies that option under python 2.4/2.5, we fail with an
Exception as those versions do not support certificate checking.

Sorry, I got it twice wrong in my description. If you want to test this,
the correct setting name is:

[Repository Imapfoobar]
sslcacertfile = /absolute/path/to/cert

Tested here with my mail.dreamhost.com server and it works fine.

Long known/documented limitation, I don't think this is RC.  A fix can
still be considered either before release or for a point update.

This has been fixed in the current testing version.

[Repository Imapfoobar]
sslcacertfile = /absolute/path/to/cert

containing a CA cert file in PEM format will actually verify the SSL
cert. There are further improvements to be made (check SSL fingerprint
like mutt does), but this bug is fixed in testing.

```
Package: offlineimap
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

offlineimap performs absolutely no ssl certificate checking. So users could/can be the victim of a man in the middle attack.
In debian the following bugs exist:

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=536421> (re certificate expiration)
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=153240> (re ssl fingerprint checking)

This could be considered a bug in imaplib (<http://bugs.python.org/issue10274>).
A partial 'fix' is the following(this 'fix' isn't complete and would break connections to servers using self-signed certificates):

WARNING XXX: I haven't tested this 'fix' at all and so it is most likely wrong.

Although, this isn't complete because it will break self-signed certificate using servers and <http://bugs.python.org/issue1589> means that it won't provide full protection etc.
Really, what is required is that by default the certificate is checked and perhaps an option is added to bypass the check.

This isn't a new discovery, see [1], but the package provides no warning about this fact. I added a warning too <https://github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/wiki/> perhaps debian can add a warning (in the package description) until this is fixed.

Erh No ... I added that. I didn't see on the homepage erh...?
Also my bug report here links to the 2007 thread post already...

Here have a patch!
This obviously will break connecting to hosts which use a self-signed
certificate.
Perhaps some one else can fix this when they want it fixed ;) ?
I tested using the following config:

# Sample minimal config file.  Copy this to ~/.offlineimaprc and edit to
# suit to get started fast.

[general]
accounts = Test

[Account Test]
localrepository = Local
remoterepository = Remote

[Repository Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/Test

[Repository Remote]
type = IMAP
ssl = yes
remotehost = imap.gmail.com # this should work
#remotehost = 74.125.39.109 # this should fail
#remotehost = $putselfsignedserveraddresshere #this should fail
remoteuser = jgoerzen

For these hosts (listed here) the expected outcome matched the actual
outcome when I tried offlineimap.

```

But that looks kind of ugly, having a hardcoded path... Also, I wonder
if not self.certfile should be used for verification?

Subject: Is 603450 realy release critical?

```
Hi release manager,

#603450 is a bug (currently with severity grave, Justification: user
security hole), as offlineimap does no ssl certificate checking.

While I agree, that this is a really important feature, which should be
fixed, I'm wondering, if that really is release critical.

There's patch floating arround, which has a major regression: It doesn't
work for users of self signed certificates.  Should this bug be seen as
of release critical severity, would you therefore at least consider
tagging it squeeze-ignore?

Best Regards,
  Alexander

Looking over the list of release critical bugs, I stumbled over the
package offlineimap, which currently has one release critical bug open
(and therefore risks of being removed from the release,
http:/bugs.debian.org/603450 for details).

I'm just wondering, if you are still interested in maintain this
package, and if you could help prepare a fix for this bug in time.  It
would be a shame, if we couldn't ship offlineimape any more :(

Best Regards,
  Alexander

Sorry?
Um. Well sure a hard coded path path not be the best thing ... if you
know how to determine the path to the ca store on a system modify the
patch to use that I guess.

Sorry, that was complete nonsense.  For a moment I thought one could use
the certfile parameter to specify a file holding certs for verification.

I take my question back.  Sorry for the noise.

Could you explain why it should be acceptable to announce secure
operation but ignore the very basic principles of it? #564690 is an old
example of the same problem.

From what I've seen in the bug, even you should be able to fix that.

So is #547092 (which has severity important).  And I'm sure if we dig
deep enough, we can find others as well.

Could you explain how an example of a bug with a severity set by
yourself supports your point, considering that the maintainer of this
package only agreed about the bugs severity because it was a regression?

FWIW: As an offlineimap user I'd be very unhappy if it stopped
working with my IMAP server with its self-signed certificate.

Folks, no matter what the technical disagreement (if any) is, please try
hard(er) to refrain from this kind of ad hominem comments.

Any potential Debian contributor seeing a comment like this one, will
probably think twice before chiming in and help out in this or any other
bug, because they will for sure have better things to do in life than
risking of being annoyed this way when working as volunteers.

People don't need to be friends to work together in Debian, but acting
as enemies surely get in the way of efficient technical collaboration.

Thanks for considering,
Cheers.

Date: Mon, 13 Dec 2010 18:35:29 -0600
```
Was just pointed to this bug. The fix would probably work, however only
under python >= 2.6. ssl_wrapper calls ssl.wrap() under 2.6, but socket.ssl()
under Python 2.4 and 2.5.

And socket.ssl does not take these parameters:
cert_reqs=..., ca_certs=...

So either we have to give up python 2.5 compatability and require 2.6
for SSL connections, or do more work to work on python 2.4

If we specify a cacertfile= setting in the Repository section of an IMAP
server,
validate it on python>=2.6 or fail with python<=2.5.
The hostname check should propbably be made optional.

This should make debian happy.

This is a big patch for inspection and review (sorry didn't try to break
it up yet). It implements SSL Certificate checking so taht Debian does
not pull us out. Cert checking gets enabled when the user specifies
sslcacert=path/to/file in the Repository section of offlineimaprc. It
also checks that the hostname of the certificate matches the connection
host name.

If the user specifies that option under python 2.4/2.5, we fail with an
Exception as those versions do not support certificate checking.

Sorry, I got it twice wrong in my description. If you want to test this,
the correct setting name is:

[Repository Imapfoobar]
sslcacertfile = /absolute/path/to/cert

Tested here with my mail.dreamhost.com server and it works fine.

Long known/documented limitation, I don't think this is RC.  A fix can
still be considered either before release or for a point update.

![](/cgi-bin/libravatar.cgi?email=Sebastian%40SSpaeth.de)
From: Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@SSpaeth.de>
To: 603450@bugs.debian.org
Subject: FIXED
Date: Thu, 03 Mar 2011 18:57:55 +0100
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=603450;msg=110) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
This has been fixed in the current testing version.

[Repository Imapfoobar]
sslcacertfile = /absolute/path/to/cert

containing a CA cert file in PEM format will actually verify the SSL
cert. There are further improvements to be made (check SSL fingerprint
like mutt does), but this bug is fixed in testing.

Subject: CVE Request -- OfflineIMAP -- 1), failed to validate remote SSL server
 certificate 2), allows SSLv2 protocol

Hello Steve, vendors,

   two issues with security implications have been recently reported against OfflineIMAP:

   I), Didn't check SSL server certificate

   Description:
   OfflineIMAP prior commit:
   [1] <https://github.com/nicolas33/offlineimap/commit/4f57b94e2333c37c5a7251fc88dfeda9bc0b226a>

   did not perform SSL server certificate validation,
   even when "ssl = yes" option was specified in the
   configuration file. If an attacker was able to get
   a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a
   Certificate Authority trusted by OfflineIMAP,
   the attacker could use the certificate during a
   man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse
   OfflineIMAP into accepting it by mistake.

   References:
   [2] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=603450>
   [3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=665382>

   II), Allows SSLv2 protocol

   Description:
   In commit:
   [4] <https://github.com/nicolas33/offlineimap/commit/4f57b94e2333c37c5a7251fc88dfeda9bc0b226a>

   when SSL server certificate validation support was added
   to OfflineIMAP it was still possible to use SSL v2 protocol
   version. Version 2 of SSL protocol version is known
   to be prone to multiple deficiencies, each of them
   having security implications (to mention some of them):
   [5] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer#Security>

   Thus SSLv2 protocol version should be disabled in OfflineIMAP.

   References:
   [6] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=606962>
   [7] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=665386>

Could you allocate CVE ids for these issues? (though opened for
discussion of any / none of them worthy of it)

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=665382#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-23 14:24:29 UTC  ``` OfflineIMAP prior commit: [1] <https://github.com/nicolas33/offlineimap/commit/4f57b94e2333c37c5a7251fc88dfeda9bc0b226a>  did not perform SSL server certificate validation, even when "ssl = yes" option was specified in the configuration file. If an attacker was able to get  a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a  Certificate Authority trusted by OfflineIMAP,  the attacker could use the certificate during a  man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse  OfflineIMAP into accepting it by mistake.  References: [2] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=603450>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=665382#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-23 14:46:25 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the offlineimap package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.  Please schedule an update with the above patch.  Note: OfflineIMAP v6.3.1 was also released:       [1] <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.mail.imap.offlineimap.general/2138>             but didn't check if it contains the change already.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=665382#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-23 14:55:13 UTC  ``` CVE Request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/12/23/2>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=665382#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-23 15:17:16 UTC  ``` Created offlineimap tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 665399](show_bug.cgi?id=665399 "CLOSED EOL - offlineimap various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=665382#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-01-05 23:28:48 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned the name CVE-2010-4532:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/4010>   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
