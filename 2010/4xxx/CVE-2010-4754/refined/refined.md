  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The `glob()` function in libc lacks proper limits on the number of `readdir()` and `stat()` system calls, leading to resource exhaustion.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Unbounded resource consumption by `glob()` function.",
        "Lack of input validation for glob patterns in applications using the `glob()` function."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory). Affected services such as FTP servers become unresponsive. The vulnerability can lead to crashes and kernel panics.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted glob patterns to vulnerable applications, such as FTP servers via the `STAT` command.",
         "Crafted patterns can also be used in other applications using `glob()`, such as `sftp`, `openssh`, and `ksh`."
        ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to establish a network connection to the vulnerable service (e.g., FTP), sending a malicious pattern. No special user privileges are required.",
        "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is triggered by using patterns with many `*/..` sequences, especially when no matching files or directories are found, causing `glob()` to execute a large number of `readdir()` and `stat()` operations. This vulnerability is not controlled by `GLOB_LIMIT` due to lack of result matching."
