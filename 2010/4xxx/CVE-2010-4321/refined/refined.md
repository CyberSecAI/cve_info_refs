    "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "Extracted Details": [
      {
        "Source": "www.novell.com_52c7b8d9_20250124_212204.html",
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies within the ienipp.ocx component, specifically in the `GetDriverSettings` method which calls `nipplib!IppGetDriverSettings2`. The process blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Overflow"
        ],
        "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.",
         "Attack vectors": [
          "Visiting a malicious page",
          "Opening a malicious file"
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to host malicious page or file.",
        "Additional Details": "The fix is available in the 'iPrint Client for Windows XP/Vista/Win 7 5.56' patch or later."

        "Source": "www.exploit-db.com_b2d415b4_20250124_212200.html",
        "Root cause": "The `GetDriverSettings()` method in the Novell iPrint ActiveX control copies user-supplied data to a fixed size buffer, resulting in a stack buffer overflow.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Overflow"
        ],
        "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
         "Attack vectors": [
          "Visiting a malicious web page"
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to host malicious web page.",
           "Additional Details": "The exploit uses shellcode to execute code on the target machine and it also mentions the existence of a `GetDriverSettings2` call that triggers the same vulnerable code path."

         "Source": "www.zerodayinitiative.com_39d451aa_20250124_212206.html",
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to the `GetDriverSettings` method, which when called, makes an internal call to `nipplib!IppGetDriverSettings2`. This function copies user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Overflow"
        ],
       "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Visiting a malicious web page",
          "Opening a malicious file."
        ],
         "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to host malicious page or file",
         "Additional Details": "The vulnerability exists in the `ienipp.ocx` component, and a patch was released as 'iPrint Client for Windows XP/Vista/Win 7 5.56'."
