Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `news.php` file of the "Immo Makler" script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The script is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code into the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (userid, name, pass, email).
- **Database Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
- **Server Control:** In some cases, SQL injection can lead to more severe consequences, potentially gaining control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `news.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious queries.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit does not indicate a need for authentication prior to exploitation

**Technical Details:**
- The proof of concept provided shows that by sending a request to `news.php?id=-1+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,concat(version()),7,8,9+from+user--`, an attacker can inject SQL commands.
- The exploit specifically targets the `user` table and retrieves information, including the database version and potentially user details.
