  "cve": "CVE-2010-4502",
  "description": "The KmxSbx.sys kernel driver distributed with CA Security Suite contains a pool corruption vulnerability in the handling of IOCTL 0x88000080. Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow leading to heap overflow",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Kernel pool overflow",
      "Integer wrapping",
      "Miscalculation of buffer size when allocating memory pool",
       "Uncontrolled copy of data to kernel pool."
    ],
     "impact": "Arbitrary code execution in kernel mode, leading to complete system compromise.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access required."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system and the ability to send IOCTL to the vulnerable kernel driver."
