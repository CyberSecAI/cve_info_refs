## SCADA Engine BACnet OPC Client buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#660688

Original Release Date: 2011-02-03 | Last Revised: 2011-02-03

---

### Overview

SCADA Engine BACnet OPC Client contains a buffer overflow when parsing .csv files. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| According to SCADA Engine [website](http://www.scadaengine.com/software1.html): "The SCADA Engine BACnet OPC Server is a server that provides data access (DA), Alarms and Events (AE), and Historical Data Access (HDA) between OPC clients and BACnet-compliant devices." SCADA Engine BACnet OPC Client contains a stack-based buffer overflow when parsing .csv files. The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error in the WTclient.dll library when preparing a status log message.  For additional information see ICS-CERT Advisory [ICSA-10-264-01](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-264-01.pdf). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a crafted .csv file, leading to execution of arbitrary code. Failed execution of this vulnerability may also lead to denial-of-service conditions. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**SCADA Engine has released BACnet OPC Client version [1.0.25](http://www.scadaengine.com/downloads.html). |
| --- |

| **Do not access .csv files from untrusted sources**Attackers may host malicious .csv files on web sites. In order to convince users to visit their sites, those attackers often use a variety of techniques to create misleading links including URL encoding, URL redirectors on legitimate sites, IP address variations, long URLs, and intentional misspellings. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or instant messaging or chat channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# BACnet OPC Client Buffer Overflow Exploit
# Jeremy Brown [0xjbrown41-gmail-com]
# Sept 2010
#
# After communicating via several emails with the vendor, sharing details
# about the vulnerability, as well as proof-of-concept code (I also offered
# to send the exploit code for them to test themselves). But it was clear that
# they weren't very interested in fixing the vulnerability. They even ended our
# conversation with "Hi Jeremy, thanks but please don't waste my time.", and
# quickly became unresponsive to further communication. A couple days later, I
# notified them know of my plans to release exploit code to the public, proving
# the vulnerability, since they weren't planning on releasing a fix. They didn't
# respond with anything indicating plans for an update, so maybe this will help.
#
# If you are a customer (they seem to care much more about your concerns), I would
# suggest contacting support at scadaengine.com and ask them to issue a fix.
#
# Successfully tested on Windows XP Service Pack 3 with BACnet OPC CLient 1.0.24
