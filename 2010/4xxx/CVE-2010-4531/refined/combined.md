# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The problem has been fixed upstream in version pcsc-lite 1.6.5.
pcsc-lite 1.6.6 is available in experimental ans will be uploaded to sid
after squeeze is out.

The attacker needs to have a physical access to the computer and a
specially crafter smart card. I don't plan to fix the problem in squeeze
(so lowering the severity).

Thanks

Subject: CVE Request -- 1, ccid -- int.overflow leading to array index error
 2, pcsc-lite stack-based buffer overflow in ATR decoder [was:
 CVE request: opensc buffer overflow ]

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   Rafael Dominguez Vega of MWR InfoSecurity reported two more flaws
related with smart cards:

   II), pcsc-lite: Stack-based buffer overflow in Answer-to-Reset (ATR)
decoder

   Description:
   A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way
   PC/SC Lite smart card framework decoded certain attribute
   values of the Answer-to-Reset (ATR) message, received back
   from the card after connecting. A local attacker could
   use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
   of the user running the pcscd daemon, via a malicious smart
   card inserted to the system USB port.

An administrator making use of a serial card reader is likely to have
done this prior to the attacker having access to the reader.

I don't want to blow things out of proportion, but these bugs
completely violate the security model that is intended by card readers.
So even though the exploit is difficult and requires local access, it is
a real issue and really needs to be fixed.

I don't want to play bts ping pong, but this really should be fixed for
squeeze (making it RC).  I suggest re-raising severity, and I will apply
the patches myself (since they're rather modest) if you aren't willing
to do so yourself. I'll also do an SPU for lenny.

Best wishes,
Mike

Michael, go for the RC severity and NMU. I can't do the upload now myself.

The upstream corrective patche is in SVN revision 5370.

Subject: CVE Request -- 1, ccid -- int.overflow leading to array index error
 2, pcsc-lite stack-based buffer overflow in ATR decoder [was:
 CVE request: opensc buffer overflow ]

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   Rafael Dominguez Vega of MWR InfoSecurity reported two more flaws related with smart cards:

   I), CCID: Integer overflow, leading to array index error when processing crafted serial number of certain cards

   Description:
   An integer overflow, leading to array index error was found
   in the way USB CCID (Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices) driver
   processed certain values of card serial number. A local attacker
   could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code, with the privileges
   of the user running the pcscd daemon, via a malicious smart card
   with specially-crafted value of its serial number, inserted to
   the system USB port.

   [3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664986>

   [5] <http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pcsclite-cvs-commit/2010-November/004935.html>

   II), pcsc-lite: Stack-based buffer overflow in Answer-to-Reset (ATR) decoder

   Description:
   A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way
   PC/SC Lite smart card framework decoded certain attribute
   values of the Answer-to-Reset (ATR) message, received back
   from the card after connecting. A local attacker could
   use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
   of the user running the pcscd daemon, via a malicious smart
   card inserted to the system USB port.

Could you allocate CVE ids for these two too?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=664999#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-22 12:34:01 UTC  ``` A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way PC/SC Lite smart card framework decoded certain attribute  values of the Answer-to-Reset (ATR) message, received back from the card after connecting. A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the pcscd daemon, via a malicious smart card inserted to the system USB port.
