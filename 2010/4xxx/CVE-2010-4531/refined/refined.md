{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ATRDecodeAtr` function within the Answer-to-Reset (ATR) handler of the pcscd service. This vulnerability is triggered when the service processes a specially crafted Answer-to-Reset (ATR) message from a smart card.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling ATR data.",
      "Lack of input validation when processing ATR data received from a smart card."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the `pcscd` daemon. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A physically proximate attacker can exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious smart card into the system's USB port.",
      "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted ATR message via the malicious smart card."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires physical access to the system and the ability to control the data presented by a smart card to the pcscd service. Specifically, the attacker needs the ability to send a malicious ATR message.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `pcsc-lite` smart card framework decodes attribute values of the Answer-to-Reset (ATR) message received from a card after connection. The `ATRDecodeAtr` function in `atrhandler.c` does not properly validate the length of the ATR data, leading to a buffer overflow when handling a long attribute value. The vulnerability was identified by MWR InfoSecurity."
