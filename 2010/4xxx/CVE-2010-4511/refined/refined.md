The provided content is related to CVE-2010-4511.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly mentioned, but the release notes indicate that multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in previous versions of Movable Type. These include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code in a logged-in user's web browser.
- SQL Injection: A remote attacker could read or modify the contents of the system under certain circumstances.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- XSS: An attacker could execute arbitrary code in a logged-in user's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions within the application's context.
- SQL Injection: An attacker could read or modify data within the system's database. This could lead to data breaches, data corruption, or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
The specific attack vectors for these vulnerabilities are not detailed, but the general vectors are:
- XSS: Exploiting vulnerabilities within the application's web interface to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users.
- SQL Injection: Exploiting vulnerabilities in database queries to inject malicious SQL code and gain access to the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker, no specific access required besides being able to interact with the Movable Type application, likely over the web.
- For XSS: The attacker needs to inject malicious script into a page viewed by a logged-in user.
- For SQL Injection: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate user input to modify database queries.
