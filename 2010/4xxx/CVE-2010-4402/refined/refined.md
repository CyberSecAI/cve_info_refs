{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Register Plus plugin for WordPress contains multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of anti-automation measures.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in multiple fields (First Name, Last Name, Website, AIM, Yahoo IM, Jabber / Google Talk, Password, Confirm Password, About Yourself) due to lack of input sanitization.",
    "Insufficient Anti-automation: The registration form lacks CAPTCHA or similar protection against automated requests.",
    "Full path disclosure: The plugin reveals the full server path through the `dash_widget.php` and `register-plus.php` files."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts via XSS, perform automated registration requests, and obtain sensitive information about the server's directory structure.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "XSS: By submitting crafted POST requests to the registration page (`http://site/wp-login.php?action=register`) with malicious JavaScript in the vulnerable fields.",
    "Insufficient Anti-automation: By sending automated registration requests to the registration page.",
     "Full path disclosure: By accessing `http://site/wp-content/plugins/register-plus/dash_widget.php` and `http://site/wp-content/plugins/register-plus/register-plus.php`"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target website. For the XSS vulnerability, the attacker would need to have the ability to induce a user to visit the registration page with malicious input or find a way to automatically submit the crafted request. For the full path disclosure, simply accessing the file through a web browser would be sufficient. For the insufficient anti-automation, the attacker needs a way to send automated requests."
