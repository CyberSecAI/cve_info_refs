{
  "CVE-2010-4021": {
    "Root cause": "The krb5 KDC (release krb5-1.7 only) allows an arbitrary TGT credential to serve as the armor for TGS requests. An attacker controlling a service principal can alter the inner request within the armored request.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient restriction on TGT credentials used for armoring TGS requests"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated remote attacker, controlling a legitimate service principal, could obtain a valid service ticket to itself containing valid KDC-generated authorization data for a client whose TGS-REQ it has intercepted. The attacker could then use this ticket for S4U2Proxy to impersonate the targeted client even if the client never authenticated to the subverted service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network. The attacker needs to intercept a legitimate TGS-REQ message.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated remote user that controls a legitimate service principal and can intercept TGS-REQ messages. The attacker also needs S4U2Proxy privileges to impersonate the client."
