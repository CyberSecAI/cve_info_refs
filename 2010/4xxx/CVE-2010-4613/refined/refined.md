The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Hycus CMS version 1.0.3, including Local File Inclusion (LFI) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `site` variable within `/index.php` and `admin.php` scripts.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive files, including configuration files and system files, leading to information disclosure.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `site` parameter to `/index.php` or `admin.php`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No special capabilities are required beyond network access to the vulnerable server.

2.  **SQL Injection (Multiple Instances):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `useremail`, `q`, `user_name`, and `usr_email` variables in `/index.php` script.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially alter queries to the application SQL database, execute arbitrary queries, compromise the application, access or modify sensitive data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying SQL database.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with malicious `useremail`, `q`, `user_name`, or `usr_email` parameters to `/index.php` with the relevant script called.
        *  `useremail` through `/?user/1/forgotpass.html`
        *  `q` through `/?search/1.html`
        *  `user_name` and `usr_email` through `/?user/1/hregister.html`
        *  `usr_email` through `/?user/1/hlogin.html`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No special capabilities are required beyond network access to the vulnerable server.

The provided content includes Proof of Concept (PoC) examples for each vulnerability. The LFI PoCs include paths that attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file. The SQLi PoCs inject SQL code through different parameters in various forms.
