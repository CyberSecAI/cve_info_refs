Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4855:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `oku.asp` page of xWeblog v2.2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `makale_id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive data, such as user credentials (username and password from the `uyeler` table), from the database.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can be a stepping stone to other attacks, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `oku.asp` page. The `makale_id` parameter within the URL is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, and does not require any prior access to the server.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic understanding of SQL is needed to craft the malicious payload.

**More Details:**

*   The provided exploit demonstrates how to retrieve the `AD` (username) and `SIFRE` (password) fields from the `uyeler` table using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
*   The exploit uses the following payload in the `makale_id` parameter: `-67 UNION SELECT 0,AD,SIFRE,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 from uyeler`
