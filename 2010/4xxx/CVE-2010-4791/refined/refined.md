Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-4791:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability exists in the `mg_user_fotoalbum.php` file of the PHP-Fusion mg user fotoalbum mod, specifically in how it handles the `album_id` parameter within the URL. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication, read sensitive database information (like usernames and passwords from the `fusion_users` table), potentially modify or delete data, and gain unauthorized access to the web application.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is remote, through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `mg_user_fotoalbum.php` script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*  **Exploit Details:** The provided proof-of-concept URL demonstrates a standard UNION-based SQL injection technique to retrieve user data: `http://www.site.com/infusions/mg_user_fotoalbum_panel/mg_user_fotoalbum.php?album_user_id=251&album_id=%27+union+select+1,2,3,4,user_name,6,7,8,9,10,11+from+fusion_users+where+user_id=1--+`

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Software:** PHP-Fusion mg user fotoalbum version 1.0.1 and possibly earlier.
*   **Exploitability:** The exploitability of this vulnerability is high due to the remote attack vector, low attack complexity and the lack of authentication requirements.
*   **CVE:** The content confirms that the identified vulnerability is related to CVE-2010-4791.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
*   **CVSS Score:** A CVSS base score of 7.5/10 is mentioned in one of the articles, with an exploitability subscore of 10/10.
