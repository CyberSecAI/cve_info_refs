Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-4879

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `dompdf.php` script directly using user-supplied input from the `input_file` GET parameter without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the code uses `rawurldecode($_GET["input_file"])` which decodes URL-encoded characters, allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion. The application fetches a file specified in the `input_file` parameter and attempts to include it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This can lead to full system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `input_file` parameter.
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker injects a URL pointing to a malicious file using the `input_file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable `dompdf.php` script.
- **Ability to host malicious file:** The attacker must have the ability to host a malicious file accessible via a URL.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet highlights the issue:
```php
if ( isset($_GET["input_file"]) )
$file = rawurldecode($_GET["input_file"]);
else
throw new DOMPDF_Exception("An input file is required (i.e. input_file _GET variable).");
```
This code directly assigns the decoded value of the `input_file` parameter to the `$file` variable without any checks, allowing an attacker to provide an external URL.

**Example Exploit:**
```
http://www.site.com/dompdf/dompdf.php?input_file=[evilc0de.txt?]
```
In this example, `evilc0de.txt` would be a remotely hosted malicious file.
