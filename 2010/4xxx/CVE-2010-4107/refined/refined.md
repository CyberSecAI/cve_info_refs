{
  "CVE-2010-4107": {
    "Description": "A directory traversal vulnerability has been found in the PJL file system access interface of various HP LaserJet MFP devices. File system access through PJL is usually restricted to a specific part of the file system. Using a pathname such as 0:\\..\\..\\..\\ it is possible to get access to the complete file system of the device.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient path validation in the Printer Job Language (PJL) file system access interface. Specifically, the software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied pathnames, allowing directory traversal using '..' sequences.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Insufficient Path Sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to disclose and potentially modify sensitive information stored on the affected device. This could include spooled print jobs, received faxes, log files, and other device settings.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted PJL command over the network to the device, typically through port 9100.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable printer's port 9100 and the ability to send PJL commands."
