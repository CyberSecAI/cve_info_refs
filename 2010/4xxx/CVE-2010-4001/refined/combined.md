| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=644596#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-19 20:07:41 UTC  ``` Ludwig Nussel discovered that gromacs contained a script that could be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  The vulnerability is due to an insecure change to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and environment variable used by ld.so(8) to look for libraries in directories other than the standard paths.  When there is an empty item in the colon-separated list of directories in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so(8) treats it as a '.' (current working directory).  If the given script is executed from a directory where a local attacker could write files, there is a chance for exploitation.  In Fedora, /usr/bin/GMXRC.bash re-sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH insecurely:  tmppath="" for i in `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | sed "s/:/ /g"`; do   if test "$i" != "$GMXLDLIB"; then     tmppath=${tmppath}:$i   fi done LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$tmppath  One solution would be to do some shell monkey work (probably something easier but I can't think of it at the moment) like this:  tmppath="" count=0 for i in `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | sed "s/:/ /g"`; do      if test "$i" != "$GMXLDLIB"; then         if [ ${count} == 0 ]; then             tmppath=$i         else             tmppath=${tmppath}:$i             count=1         fi      fi  done  That will avoid prefixing LD_LIBRARY_PATH with ":" if it's set.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=644596#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-20 16:28:43 UTC  ``` Created gromacs tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 644950](show_bug.cgi?id=644950 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2010-4001 gromacs: insecure library loading vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=644596#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-09 22:38:41 UTC  ``` MITRE has disputed this with the following note:  "NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the GMXLDLIB value is always added to the beginning of LD_LIBRARY_PATH at a later point in the script."  This can be seen in the script:  61 # NB: The variables already begin with ':' now, or are empty 62 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GMXLDLIB}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}  Seems like a strange way to handle things, but doesn't introduce any insecurities.  In fact, if nothing else, it does introduce a bug.  Using a slight variation of the script:   cat 1 #!/bin/sh tmppath="" GMXLDLIB="/usr/lib" for i in `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | sed "s/:/ /g"`; do   if test "$i" != "$GMXLDLIB"; then     if test "${tmppath}" == ""; then       tmppath=$i     else     tmppath=${tmppath}:$i   fi   fi done LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$tmppath  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GMXLDLIB}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}  echo ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}%                                                                                                                                                                                % sh 1                                      /usr/lib % LD_LIBRARY_PATH="" sh 1     /usr/lib % LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/foo" sh 1 /usr/lib/foo % LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/foo:/usr/lib:/bar" sh 1 /usr/lib/foo:/bar  But that isn't a security issue as GMXLDLIB always gets prefixed, but the path string gets munged badly.  Probably better to have this in there instead:  if [ -z ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} ]; then     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GMXLDLIB} else     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${GMXLDLIB}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} fi   At any rate, I do agree with MITRE's assessment that this is not a security issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=644596#c3)  Christoph Junghans    2018-04-11 20:25:46 UTC  ``` This has been fixed in 2016.1-2:  * Fri Dec 23 2016 Christoph Junghans <junghans> - 2016.1-2 - drop dangerous GMXRC* - not needed when installed in /usr   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=644596#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 10:57:22 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.
