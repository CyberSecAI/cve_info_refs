```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The file `fileman_file_upload.php` in Orbis CMS does not properly verify file uploads, allowing an authenticated user to upload a PHP script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Arbitrary file upload leading to arbitrary script execution.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is accessible to any authenticated user through the file upload functionality of the CMS.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the Orbis CMS. After authentication, they can upload the malicious PHP script.
