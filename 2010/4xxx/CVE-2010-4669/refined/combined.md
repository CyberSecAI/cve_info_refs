# Recent advances in IPv6 insecurities

![](../images/event-3957-128x128.png)

New protocol features have been proposed and implemented in the last 5 years and ISPs are now slowly starting to deploy IPv6. This talk starts with a brief summary of the issues presented five years ago, and then expands on the new risks.
Discovered implemention security issues in Windows 7/2008, Linux and Cisco will be shown too. Comes with a GPL'ed toolkit: thc-ipv6

Five years have past since my initial talk on IPv6 insecurities at the CCC Congress.
New protocol features have been proposed and implemented since then and ISPs are now slowly starting to deploy IPv6.
Few changes have led to a better security of the protocol, several increase the risk instead.
This talk starts with a brief summary of the issues presented 5 years ago, and then expands on the new risks especially in multicast scenarios.
As an add-on, discovered implemention security issues in Windows 7/2008, Linux and Cisco will be shown too. Lets hope patches are out until the conference, if not - they had enough time.
All accompanied with GPL'ed tools to and a library: the new thc-ipv6 package. rewritten, expanded, enhanced.

For those who could not attend: on the 29th at 12:00 at b(erlin)sides @ c-base I do the presentation again
