| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=666793#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-01-03 08:40:30 UTC  ``` Several stack-based buffer overflows were found in the way gimp processes plug-in configuration files. An attacker could create a a specially-crafted plug-in configuration file and trick the local,  unsuspecting user into opening it, which could lead to gimp to crash the plugin or, potentially , arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the executable.  Reference: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=608497>  Public PoC: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=5;filename=gimp-overflows-poc-in-cobol.cob;att=1;bug=608497>  Flaw severity note: On systems with compile time buffer checks (FORTIFY_SOURCE) feature enabled, the impact of this flaw is mitigated to be only crash.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=666793#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-01-04 18:40:34 UTC  ``` There are four buffer overflows here and as a result this has been given four CVE names:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/4025>  [CVE-2010-4540](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4540) gimp LIGHTING EFFECTS > LIGHT plugin stack buffer overflow [CVE-2010-4541](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4541) gimp SPHERE DESIGNER plugin stack buffer overflow [CVE-2010-4542](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4542) gimp GFIG plugin stack buffer overflow [CVE-2010-4543](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4543) gimp heap overflow read_channel_data() in file-psp.c  If we need to, we can split these into separate bugs (but I think that when we fix them, we would do them all at once, so only split this if any of these don't affect something we ship).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=666793#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-10 09:49:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=666793#c2)) > There are four buffer overflows here and as a result this has been given four > CVE names: >  > <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/4025> >  > [CVE-2010-4540](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4540) gimp LIGHTING EFFECTS > LIGHT plugin stack buffer overflow > [CVE-2010-4541](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4541) gimp SPHERE DESIGNER plugin stack buffer overflow > [CVE-2010-4542](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4542) gimp GFIG plugin stack buffer overflow > [CVE-2010-4543](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4543) gimp heap overflow read_channel_data() in file-psp.c >  > If we need to, we can split these into separate bugs (but I think that when we > fix them, we would do them all at once, so only split this if any of these > don't affect something we ship).  This bug is now dedicated to [CVE-2010-4540](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4540) issue: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4540>  Stack-based buffer overflow in the load_preset_response function in plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the "LIGHTING EFFECTS > LIGHT" plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Position field in a plugin configuration file. NOTE: it may be uncommon to obtain a GIMP plugin configuration file from an untrusted source that is separate from the distribution of the plugin itself. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

# CVE-2010-4541

| **Name** | CVE-2010-4541 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the SPHERE DESIGNER plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long "Number of lights" field in a plugin configuration file.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=703403#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-10 09:38:48 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-4541](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4541) to the following vulnerability:  Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the SPHERE DESIGNER plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long "Number of lights" field in a plugin configuration file. NOTE: it may be uncommon to obtain a GIMP plugin configuration file from an untrusted source that is separate from the distribution of the plugin itself.

I'm going to give this four. We *might* be able to get away with two, but
since they're all in quite different bits of code, I'm betting the affected
versions are different, and it's likely upstream is going to fix these all
at different times in their SCM.

CVE-2010-4540 gimp LIGHTING EFFECTS > LIGHT plugin stack buffer overflow
CVE-2010-4541 gimp SPHERE DESIGNER plugin stack buffer overflow
CVE-2010-4542 gimp GFIG plugin stack buffer overflow
CVE-2010-4543 gimp heap overflow read_channel_data() in file-psp.c

Thanks.

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2010-4542

| **Name** | CVE-2010-4542 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Stack-based buffer overflow in the gfig\_read\_parameter\_gimp\_rgb function in plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c in the GFIG plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Foreground field in a plugin configuration file. NOTE: it may be uncommon to obtain a GIMP plugin configuration file from an untrusted source that is separate from the distribution of the plugin itself. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. |

Subject: CVE request for buffer overflows in gimp

Hello Steve, Vendors,

This one is from the debian bug tracker [1], there are four buffer
overflows in gimp plugins.

I am not sure if this would need one CVE or four?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : gimp
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4540 CVE-2010-4541 CVE-2010-4542 CVE-2010-4543
                 CVE-2011-1782 CVE-2011-2896

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program.

CVE-2010-4540
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the load_preset_response
	function in plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the "LIGHTING
	EFFECTS > LIGHT" plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers
	to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a long Position field in a plugin
	configuration file.

CVE-2010-4541
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in
	plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the SPHERE DESIGNER
	plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial
	of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
	code via a long "Number of lights" field in a plugin
	configuration file.

CVE-2010-4542
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the gfig_read_parameter_gimp_rgb
	function in in the GFIG plugin allows user-assisted remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Foreground field in a
	plugin configuration file.

CVE-2010-4543
	Heap-based buffer overflow in the read_channel_data function in
	file-psp.c in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin allows remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a PSP_COMP_RLE (aka RLE
	compression) image file that begins a long run count at the end
	of the image.

CVE-2011-1782
	The correction for CVE-2010-4543 was incomplete.

CVE-2011-2896
	The LZW decompressor in the LZWReadByte function in
	plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c does not properly handle code
	words that are absent from the decompression table when
	encountered, which allows remote attackers to trigger an
	infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly
	execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed stream.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.10-1+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.6.11-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=703405#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-10 09:39:50 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-4542](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4542) to the following vulnerability:  Stack-based buffer overflow in the gfig_read_parameter_gimp_rgb function in plug-ins/gfig/gfig-style.c in the GFIG plugin in GIMP 2.6.11 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Foreground field in a plugin configuration file.
