  "CVE-2010-4351": {
    "description": "The JNLP SecurityManager returns from the checkPermission method instead of throwing an exception in certain circumstances, which might allow context-dependent attackers to bypass the intended security policy by creating instances of ClassLoader.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The JNLP SecurityManager in IcedTea for Java OpenJDK fails to properly apply the intended security policy in its checkPermission method.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The SecurityManager.checkPermission() method does not throw an exception, leading to a bypass of security policies.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when handling an applet. It can be exploited through a malicious webpage or file that a user interacts with.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious applet and have the victim interact with it through a webpage or file."
