*   This could lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed remotely by injecting malicious code through the vulnerable `swfstore/swfstore.swf` file.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable component was part of the Flash-based components in the YUI library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious web scripts or HTML through the vulnerable `swfstore/swfstore.swf` file. This typically requires the attacker to have some control over the input or URL parameters used by the application.
