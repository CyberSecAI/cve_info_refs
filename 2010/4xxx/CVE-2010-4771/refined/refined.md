Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-4771:

**Summary:**
The provided content indicates that CVE-2010-4771 is related to multiple vulnerabilities in S\_CMS version 2.5. Specifically, it highlights a Full Path Disclosure (FPD), SQL Injection (SQLi), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the `search.php` file, and potentially others. The vulnerable parameter is `search_app`. The Exploit Database entry also provides specific examples of how to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of the `search_app` variable within the `search.php` file in S\_CMS 2.5. The vulnerability stems from lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The application leaks the full server path when a malformed input is provided to the vulnerable parameter, potentially assisting an attacker in mapping the server's directory structure.
2.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the vulnerable parameter, potentially allowing access to the database, modification of data, or complete database compromise.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the vulnerable parameter, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary scripts in a user's browser within the application context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **FPD:** Allows an attacker to gather information about the server environment, which may facilitate further attacks.
*   **SQLi:** Allows attackers to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to full compromise of the application. Attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive user information (credentials), modify content, etc.
*   **XSS:** Allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of the vulnerable application, potentially leading to account hijacking, session stealing, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerabilities are located in the `viewforum.php` script, specifically the `id` parameter that is passed to the server. The `search_app` parameter inside `search.php` is also vulnerable.
*   Attackers can manipulate HTTP GET requests to inject malicious payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication or a privileged position within the application to exploit these vulnerabilities, since they are directly related to input sanitization and validation.
