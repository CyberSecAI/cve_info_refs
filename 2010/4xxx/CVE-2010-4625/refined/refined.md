Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the security issues addressed in MyBB 1.4.12, which is likely the subject of CVE-2010-4625

**Root Cause of Vulnerability**
The blog post for MyBB 1.4.12 mentions patching "two medium-risk security issues and a low risk security issue."  While specific details of the vulnerabilities are not provided in this blog post, the provided discussion on the MyBB community forums and the list of modified files in the blog suggest potential areas of concern.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
- **Portal Display of Restricted Content:** The forum discussion reveals that the "Latest Threads" block on the portal page was showing threads to users who did not have permission to view the forum containing those threads. This indicates a flaw in the access control mechanism for the portal page.
- **Multiple Security Fixes:** The blog post indicates that multiple security issues were fixed, including two medium-risk and one low-risk issue. Specific details are not given, but the large number of modified files (marked in red) suggests a complex fix.

**Impact of Exploitation**
- **Information Disclosure:** The portal display issue could lead to unauthorized users viewing thread titles and potentially gaining information about restricted discussions.
- **Unspecified Medium/Low Risk Issues:** The blog post mentions additional security issues which are not specified but have a medium and low-risk rating which would have a moderate to low impact.

**Attack Vectors**
- **Portal Page Access:** The portal display issue could be exploited by any user accessing the portal page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
- **Standard User Account:** The portal issue does not appear to require elevated privileges, suggesting that a standard user account could exploit it.
- **Access to Portal Page:** The attacker must have access to the portal page on a vulnerable MyBB installation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post mentions that the security issues were reported by Stefan Esser and Labrocca.
- The large number of files modified for this release suggests that the underlying issues may be complex and involve multiple areas of the MyBB codebase.
- A hotfix for `inc/functions.php` was released shortly after the 1.4.12 release to correct an issue with the random number generator, suggesting potential related vulnerabilities or issues with the original fixes.
- The release required running the upgrader, and included database schema, language string, and template changes, which could indicate vulnerabilities related to these areas or data inconsistencies.
