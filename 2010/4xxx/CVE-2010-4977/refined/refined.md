Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `controller` parameter in `canteen.php` is not sanitized before being used in a `require_once()` function. This allows an attacker to include local files by manipulating the `controller` parameter, leading to potential code execution or information disclosure.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The `mealid` parameter in `menu.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `mealid` parameter, potentially leading to data modification, extraction, or denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in file inclusion and SQL queries. This is a classic example of a lack of input validation, which is a fundamental vulnerability.
*   **Unprotected File Inclusion:** The use of `require_once()` with an unsanitized `controller` parameter creates an entry point for LFI attacks.
*   **SQL Injection:** The use of unsanitized `mealid` in SQL queries leads to SQL injection vulnerability, specifically blind SQL injection, as the attacker might not get output to the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can include sensitive configuration files and gain access to confidential data
*   **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers could insert, update, or delete data.
    *   **Data Extraction:** Attackers could extract sensitive data from database.
    *   **Denial of Service:** By injecting malicious SQL code, attackers could cause application malfunctions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LFI:** HTTP GET request with a manipulated `controller` parameter in the URL, targeting `canteen.php`. Example:
    `http://site/path/index.php?option=com_canteen&controller=../../../../../etc/passwd%00`
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** HTTP GET request with manipulated `mealid` parameter in the URL, targeting `menu.php`. The injected SQL can be within the `mealid` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required for the vulnerability to be exploited.
*   **Knowledge of Application Structure:** The attacker needs to know the URL structure and the vulnerable parameters, but this information is available from the provided information.

**Additional Information:**
