{
  "CVE-2010-4335": {
    "Description": "CakePHP is vulnerable to a file inclusion attack because of its use of the \"unserialize()\" function on unchecked user input. This makes it possible to inject arbitrary objects into the scope.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the `unserialize()` function on user-controlled data within the `SecurityComponent` of CakePHP. This occurs when processing the `_Token[fields]` parameter within POST requests, where the value is first URL decoded, then a portion of it is extracted, ROT13 decoded, and finally unserialized.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe deserialization of user-provided data",
      "Lack of proper input validation and sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary file inclusion. By crafting a malicious serialized object, an attacker can manipulate the CakePHP cache and inject arbitrary PHP code, which will then be executed.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to a CakePHP application. The attacker needs to include a `_Token[fields]` parameter containing a malicious serialized object.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable CakePHP application and have knowledge of the application's structure, specifically the cache location and the usage of the Security component. No authentication is required."
