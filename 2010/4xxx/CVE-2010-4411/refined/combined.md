## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

CGI.pm is used by the Bugzilla code base. However, Bugzilla may not
always be vulnerable to issues in CGI.pm depending on they use it.

Yes, it is. However, later testing found that the issue wasn't
completely fixed in 3.50. A new patch has been developed, and is
currently pending review and acceptance by the primary CGI.pm author,
Lincoln Stein. (Now CC'ed).

Note that CGI::Simple also shares the header newline injection issue
with CGI.pm, but remains unpatched. I submitted a patch, but it has not
been applied, as seen in the Network view:

<https://github.com/markstos/CGI--Simple/network>

However, even the patch I submitted is not fully complete, as it mirrors
the 3.50 state of CGI.pm, and thus also needs further work. Once CGI.pm
has a final update to address the remaining header injection issue, I'll
share the same patch with CGI::Simple.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Found in chart.cgi:
print "Location: query.cgi?format=" . $cgi->param('query\_format') .
($params ? "&$params" : "") . "\n\n";
print "Location: buglist.cgi" . ($params ? "?$params" : "") . "\n\n";
We should use $cgi->redirect instead.

This should work, but should I be using |-uri => correct\_urlbase() . "blah.cgi"| instead, or is this fine? We seem to vary on usage one way or another throughout the codebase.

<http://search.cpan.org/~lds/CGI.pm-3.50/lib/CGI.pm#GENERATING_A_REDIRECTION_HEADER> recommends to use full URL, not relative ones:
"You should always use full URLs (including the http: or ftp: part) in redirection requests. Relative URLs will not work correctly."

For now you should be using $cgi->url to generate a full URL, unless $cgi->redirect does that internally.

Okay, this is actually what buglist.cgi does already, so this is fine.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, and and 4.0rc1 Security Advisory

Monday, Jan 24th, 2011
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A weakness in Bugzilla could allow a user to gain unauthorized access
  to another Bugzilla account.

* A weakness in the Perl CGI.pm module allows injecting HTTP headers
  and content to users via several pages in Bugzilla.

* The new user autocomplete functionality in Bugzilla 4.0 is vulnerable
  to a cross-site scripting attack.

* The new automatic duplicate detection functionality in Bugzilla 4.0
  is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

* If you put a harmful "javascript:" or "data:" URL into Bugzilla's
  "URL" field, then there are multiple situations in which Bugzilla
  will unintentionally make that link clickable.

* Various pages lack protection against cross-site request forgeries.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Account Compromise
Affected:    2.14 to 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
             any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
             enough that the attack is highly effective). This is a
             critical vulnerability that should be patched immediately
             by all Bugzilla installations.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2761, CVE-2010-4411, CVE-2010-4572

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new client-side
             autocomplete mechanism for all fields where a username
             is entered. This mechanism was vulnerable to a cross-site
             scripting attack.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4569

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new mechanism on the
             bug entry page for automatically detecting if the bug
             you are filing is a duplicate of another existing bug.
             This mechanism was vulnerable to a cross-site scripting
             attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619648
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4570

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla has a "URL" field that can contain several types
             of URL, including "javascript:" and "data:" URLs. However,
             it does not make "javascript:" and "data:" URLs into
             clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
             attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
             protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
             Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, "javascript:" and
             "data:" links were *always- summary: |-
             shown as clickable to
             logged-out users.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4567, CVE-2011-0048

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
             Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
             as previous CSRF vulnerabilities. Some of these issues
             were only addressed on more recent branches of Bugzilla
             and not fixed in earlier branches, in order to avoid
             changing behavior that external applications may depend
             on. The links below in "References" describe which issues
             were fixed on which branches.

Hi folks,
While doing something completely unrelated, I noticed that the query\_format parameter passed to report.cgi is not properly sanitized when quoted in the "Location" header in the response.
This allows malicious headers or HTML body to be injected in order to steal cookies, poison reverse caches, etc. Proof-of-concept against bugzilla.mozilla.org (works in Firefox):

No idea. RedHat, KDE and Mandriva's Bugzilla are not vulnerable. Some of them correctly throw that the format is invalid, and some others say the page doesn't exist. No idea which ones run mod\_perl.

By looking at each $cgi->redirect() individually, the one in report.cgi seems to be the only vulnerable one. Some others, such as in long\_list.cgi, split the input string on commas and whitespaces, which seems to prevent this specific attack (no idea if it's possible to abuse CGI.pm without including spaces in the string). Also, QuickSearch.pm happily append the alias name to the URL, unfiltered, if the alias is found in the DB. As the alias is limited to 20 characters, I don't know how vulnerable QS is (can you write JS code with only 20 characters?), but probably it would be good to filter the alias there too.
$cgi->query\_string(), which is what $buffer gets, escapes the data, which is why buglist.cgi is not vulnerable.

You probably can't squeeze a full XSS payload in 20 chars, but you throw in a partial tag, e.g.:
12345678901234567890
<script src=//ab.pl/
can confuse the parser in a way that probably leads to one - say, by opening <style>, and then relying on a properly sanitized string displayed later to do something evil (CSS parser resyncs to the nearest } after parse errors).

Okay. We do need to figure out how to reproduce this bug reliably on a system other than bmo. Honestly, I'd think that CGI.pm should be responsible for validating that headers don't contain malicious stuff like that, so this shouldn't be possible.

I tested this against a system with mod\_perl, and looks like you can still inject at least one HTTP header (e.g. "Refresh" to javascript: URL, which will work in some browsers), multiple headers if you use %0D instead of %0A (works in MSIE and Chrome). I'm pretty sure this is exploitable.

This gets one header injected, "Location" booted off for me:
report-tablebogus%0aInjected-Hdr:val%00
This gets more than one header injected for MSIE/Chrome:
report-tablebogus%0dInjected-Hdr:val%00
The version of mod\_perl on my test system is a bit rusty, so let me know if you can't repro.
There are many odd things about this thing that make it difficult to do a quick PoC (e.g., = gets recoded as :, the behavior of %0d changes after %0a, %00 behaves differently), and browser quirks that come into play (^M handling, header parsing precedence, behavior of "Refresh" to javascript:, etc), but I am pretty sure it's possible. If you really need to be convinced, I can dig a bit more.

This works in Chrome for my test instance:

It used to work in Firefox, but you guys decided to disallow refresh to JS a while ago.

Yeah, thing is, header injection should \*never\* be possible in a CGI environment. I think that this is actually a bug in mod\_perl, if it's only reproducible under mod\_perl.

v3
OK, having played with Michal's example from [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=591165#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Header injection, cross-site scripting in report.cgi") with the alias field, QuickSearch correctly detects e.g. "s%0aId-Hdr:val%00" as a valid alias (the attacker just needs to file a bug and add this string in the alias field), but then, QS is indeed confused by %00 and %0a in the string as QS passed the string unfiltered to $cgi->redirect(). To fix the problem, all you need to do is to add
$alias = url\_quote($alias);
at line 251 of Quicksearch.pm, right after |if $is\_alias|.
IMO, this kind of PoC is a valid enough reason to revive [bug 313583](/show_bug.cgi?id=313583 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove long_list.cgi, showattachment.cgi and xml.cgi").

Has anybody proven yet that this is only reproducible under mod\_perl, and that it can be consistently reproduced there? %0a and %0d should never be translated by the header printer, there's no reason.

Oh, and CGI.pm lets you inject headers that way? In that case, this could be a bug in CGI.pm.

All right, I can confirm that this is a bug in CGI.pm. This will reproduce it:
print $cgi->redirect("[http://example.com/\n\n](http://example.com/%5Cn%5Cn)<html><script>alert(1)</script>");
As this may affect many Perl applications, we should first report it to the CGI.pm maintainers and if they agree that it is a bug, coordinate our release with them.

I've informed the CGI.pm maintainers. Also, a slight correction, here's a simple PoC with plain CGI.pm that actually works on my local mod\_cgi in Apache 2.2.15:

As I understand it, the fix will be to require CGI.pm 3.50 or any other relevant version which contains the security fix. I suppose we may still take the patch mkanat attached, in combination with the additional fix I proposed in [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=591165#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Header injection, cross-site scripting in report.cgi").
mkanat, does the CGI.pm maintainer plan to release 3.50 in the near future?

I just emailed the CGI.pm maintainer to ask for an update, but apparently he's out of the office until the 26th.
So that everybody else on this bug knows--the CGI.pm maintainers agree that this is a bug in CGI.pm, and they are going to fix it.
The patch that I attached probably wouldn't fix this security issue in all of Bugzilla--to do that, we'd have to override redirect() in Bugzilla::CGI. However, since this bug affects all systems using CGI.pm, I think that we shouldn't publish it until there's a fix in CGI.pm.

The CGI.pm release with the fix for this bug should be available later today.
Once it's been out for a little bit, I'm going to send out a Security Advisory simply advising people to update their CGI.pm module, along with posting a patch for all supported branches, updating the CGI.pm requirement to 3.50.

Do we really want to require 3.50 everywhere? This is going to break many installations once they upgrade, because they won't have CGI 3.50 and maybe won't know how to install it exactly. And I'm pretty sure that the Bugzilla RPM provided with some Linux distros will be updated without updating CGI.pm, as it may affect other applications too.

Well, I don't really want to require 3.50 everywhere, no, but I don't see any reasonable alternative, and this is a very serious security issue.

For 3.2 and 3.4, I would say the security advisory should be enough. Or maybe add CGI 3.50 as an optional module to get attention when running checksetup.pl? I wouldn't worry too much about 3.2, which is almost EOL. The question remains for 3.4, though.

Hmm. I like the optional module idea. That way sites who trust all their users (like fully-internal corporate installations with a small team) don't \*have\* to upgrade, but everybody else knows that they should.

So, I just tested the testcase in the URL field, and I'm still getting an alert(1) dialog, even though I had justdave upgrade the CGI.pm modules on all bmo webheads last night. Are we sure this is correctly fixed upstream?

Okay, that is bad. Is it possible that bmo is not properly using the lib/ directory? Is the lib/ directory missing from Apache's PerlSwitches line? Can I see the PerlSwitches line that the bmo webheads are using?

At the date and time of [comment 54](/show_bug.cgi?id=591165#c54 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Header injection, cross-site scripting in report.cgi"), we had reverted to CGI 3.49 on bmo because we were having severe performance issues that coincided with the upgrade and were trying to rule out all of the variables. The performance issues were determined to be unrelated, and we reupgraded to CGI 3.50 probably an hour or two after you made that comment. Retest?

I can also, unfortunately, sort of reproduce it on landfill:
<https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/report.cgi?cmd-0=1&format=table&query_format=report-tablebogus%0A%0DC%3Chtml%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E:%20s%0A%0A%0A%0AFOO>
Although it's not rendering as text/html, there is still some content being injected into the page.
It's \*not\* reproducible unless I'm running under mod\_perl, so there may also be a separate bug in the mod\_perl header-handling code.

Yeah, I thought so. When reed asked me yesterday to test on my side, I was unable to reproduce locally, using mod\_cgi. So we shouldn't send the sec adv before this is entirely fixed.

Thanks for the follow-up. A contribution to the CGI.pm test suite which triggers the remaining case would be welcome. It's less clear to me that this is a CGI.pm issue now.
There is always the option of validating the input before giving it to CGI.pm, but if there's a way that remains that CGI.pm could be better handling invalid input, I'm continue to be interested to know about it.

I looked into this further. Here's a reduced test case for it which reproduces a behavior with CGI.pm:
my $cgi = CGI->new('t=bogus%0D%0A<html>');
my $out = $cgi->redirect( $cgi->param('t') );
unlike($out, qr/s\n\n<html/, "redirect does not allow double-newline injection");
The issue is that CGI.pm has interpreted the spec strictly, and explicitly interprets CRLF as being CR + LF. The example here uses "\n\n". In mod\_perl CGI.pm's call the "send\_cgi\_header()" method with the value, and your Apache 2.2 then accepts "\n\n" as a valid header/body separator and allows the content through.
I'll have to consider how we might address this in CGI.pm. A reference how to treat "\n" as a valid CRLF value would be helpful.
Bugzilla also has the alternative of validating untrusted user input before handing it to CGI.pm.

CGI.pm 3.51 is now available via install-module.pl--could we update the requirement on all branches?
