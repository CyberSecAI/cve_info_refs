Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

* **Root Cause:** The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `search.asp` and `showAlllistings.asp` files of the MicroNetSoft RV Dealer Website application. Specifically, the application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is **SQL Injection (SQLi)**. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (`selStock` parameter in `search.asp` and `orderBy` parameter in `showAlllistings.asp`) before using it in SQL queries.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can allow attackers to:
    * Access sensitive database information.
    * Modify or delete data within the database.
    * Potentially gain control over the database server.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `search.asp` and `showAlllistings.asp` pages.
    * By manipulating the `selStock` parameter in the `search.asp` URL and the `orderBy` parameter in the `showAlllistings.asp` URL with malicious SQL code, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL statements into the application's queries.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    * No special privileges are required on the target system beyond having network access to the application.

* **Specific Vulnerable URLs:**
    * `http://[host]/[path]/search.asp?selStock=x%27%20union%20selecta`
    * `http://[host]/[path]/showAlllistings.asp?orderBy=union`

The provided information gives a clear description of the SQL injection vulnerabilities and the attack vector. It also provides specific examples of URLs that can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability, which is more detailed than the generic CVE description.
