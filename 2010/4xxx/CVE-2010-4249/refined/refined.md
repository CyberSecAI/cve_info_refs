```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A flaw in the garbage collector for AF_UNIX sockets allows a local, unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (out-of-memory condition). The kernel allocates memory for UNIX sockets but does not free it quickly enough, leading to excessive memory consumption and the potential for system instability or crash.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper resource management
- Insufficient garbage collection of unix sockets

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service (out-of-memory condition)
- System instability or crash

Attack vectors:
- Local exploitation by an unprivileged user.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to execute code locally on the target system.
- No special privileges are needed.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability is triggered by rapidly creating and closing unix sockets, thereby consuming kernel memory.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to quickly trigger the OOM condition.
- The fix involved limiting the number of inflight sockets and forcing a garbage collection if a threshold is hit.
