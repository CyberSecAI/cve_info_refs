# Welcome to MapServer[Â¶](#welcome-to-mapserver "Link to this heading")

MapServer is an [Open Source](https://opensource.org/) platform for publishing spatial data and
interactive mapping applications to the web. Originally developed in the
mid-1990âs at the University of Minnesota, MapServer is released under an
[MIT-style license](copyright.html#license), and runs on all major platforms
([Windows](download.html#windows), [Linux](download.html#linux), [Mac OS X](download.html#osx)).
MapServer is not a full-featured [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) system, nor does it aspire to
be. See the [Site Gallery](https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/wiki/MapServer-Site-Gallery)
for live examples of MapServer in action.

The MapServer [Project Steering Committee (PSC)](psc.html#psc), sanctioned by
[OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org), manages and administers the project which is maintained, improved,
and supported by developers and users from around the world.

Hi,

Can anyone please allocate two ids?

Cheers
