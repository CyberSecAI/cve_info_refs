  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2738",
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in affected versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office. The vulnerability exists because Windows and Office incorrectly parse specific font types in such a way that could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows and Office incorrectly validate a table in the OpenType font layout.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect parsing of specific font types in OpenType fonts by Windows and Office."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted document (e.g., Microsoft Office document) associated with an application that supports embedded OpenType fonts to a user. Alternatively, a user could be enticed to visit a malicious website hosting a specially crafted web page that leverages embedded OpenType fonts.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted document or webpage with malicious OpenType font content and deliver it to the victim, or entice the victim to access it via web browser.",
    "mitigations": [
      "Modify the Access Control List (ACL) on usp10.dll to be more restrictive. However, this workaround may impact the rendering of some fonts.",
      "Disable support for parsing embedded fonts in Internet Explorer, which reduces the attack surface via web browsing, but does not address embedded fonts in Office documents.",
    ]
