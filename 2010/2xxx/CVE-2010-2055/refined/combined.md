# GPL Ghostscript: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201412-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in GPL Ghostscript, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/ghostscript-gpl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.10-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.10-r2** |

### Background

Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GPL Ghostscript. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted PostScript file or PDF using GPL Ghostscript, possibly resulting
in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a
Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GPL Ghostscript users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-text/ghostscript-gpl-9.10-r2"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=627902#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-27 10:59:08 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-3743](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3743) to the following vulnerability:  Off-by-one error in the TrueType bytecode interpreter in Ghostscript before 8.71 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via a malformed TrueType font in a document.  References:   [1] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3743>   [2] <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/JALR-87YGN8>   [3] <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/644319>  Upstream bug report:   [4] <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691044>  Upstream changeset:   [5] <http://code.google.com/p/ghostscript/source/detail?r=10602>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=627902#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-30 14:52:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=627902#c0)) > Off-by-one error in the TrueType bytecode interpreter in Ghostscript  While this may possibly allow off-by-one over-read, the more important issue is an integer underflow leading to memory corruption.  Upstream patch fixes Ins_MINDEX() to skip standard processing when 0 is passed as an argument (L) to the function.  Skipped code is:      K = CUR.stack[CUR.args - L];      memmove( (&CUR.stack[CUR.args - L    ]),               (&CUR.stack[CUR.args - L + 1]),               (L - 1) * sizeof ( Long ) );      CUR.stack[ CUR.args-1 ] = K;  When L==0, memmove() is called with the third argument being (-1)*sizeof(long), which is close to SIZE_MAX or address space limit of the architecture.  Hence program will try to move all its memory, which leads to crash before that memmove() call finishes.  Memory corruption is under very limited control of an attacker, making it more difficult to reliably exploit for code execution.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=627902#c13)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-11-26 14:27:47 UTC  ``` Toucan System advisory: [1] <http://www.toucan-system.com/advisories/tssa-2010-01.txt>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=627902#c18)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-11-22 12:47:10 UTC  ``` Created ghostscript tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 755929](show_bug.cgi?id=755929 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2010-2055 CVE-2009-3743 ghostscript various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=627902#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-02 22:45:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0095.html>   ``` |  |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.

Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- kvirc
This update of KVirc fixes a remotely exploitable format string and
directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2010-2451, CVE-2010-2452).
Additionally KVirc does not further allow remote client to send
arbitrary CTCP commands. (CVE-2010-2785)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- lftp
This update of lftp improves the filename handling of downloaded files
to avoid downloading arbitrary content to unexpected locations (like
.login). (CVE-2010-2251)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libpython2\_6-1\_0
This update of python has a copy of libxmlrpc that is vulnerable to
denial of service bugs that can occur while processing malformed XML
input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,
and Access Control (CWE-264)
- CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Insufficient Information
- CVE-2009-3560: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Buffer Errors (CWE-119)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libtiff
This update of libtiff fixes several integer overflows that could lead
to a corrupted heap memory. This bug can be exploited remotely with a
crafted TIFF file to cause an application crash or probably to execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1411)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libvorbis
This update of libvorbis fixes a memory corruption while parsing OGG
files. This bug was exploitable by remote attackers to cause an
application crash and could probably be exploited to execute arbitrary
code.
CVE-2009-2663: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8: Resource Management Errors (CWE-399)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- lxsession
lxsession-logout did not properly lock the screen before suspending,
hibernating and switching between users which could allow attackers with
physical access to take control of the system to obtain sensitive infor-
mation and / or execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who is
currently logged in (CVE-2010-2532).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- mono-addon-bytefx-data-mysql/bytefx-data-mysql
Mono's ASP.NET implementation did not set the 'EnableViewStateMac'
property by default. Attackers could exploit that to conduct cross-
site-scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2010-1459)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- moodle
Moodle was prone to several Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
(CVE-2010-2228, CVE-2010-2229, CVE-2010-2230, CVE-2010-2231).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- openldap2
Specially crafted MODRDN operations can crash the OpenLDAP server.

Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- opera
Opera was upgraded to the 10.60 release.
- CVE-2010-0653: Opera permits cross-origin loading of CSS style sheets
even when the style sheet download has an incorrect
MIME type and the style sheet document is malformed,
which allows remote HTTP servers to obtain sensitive
information via a crafted document.
- CVE-2010-1993: Opera 9.52 does not properly handle an IFRAME element
with a mailto: URL in its SRC attribute, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via an HTML document with many IFRAME
elements.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS was prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities which could
allow remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code via
unspecified vectors. (CVE-2010-0438)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- popt
This update fixes the problem where RPM misses to clear the SUID/SGID
bit of old files during package updates. (CVE-2010-2059)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
This update of postgresql was pblished to fix several minor security
vulnerabilities:
- CVE-2010-1975: postgresql does not properly check privileges during
certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,

which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- python-mako
Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly

Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- vte
VTE was vulnerable to an old title set+query attack which could be used
by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2713).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- w3m
w3m did not handle embedded nul characters in the common name and in
subject alternative names of x509 certificates.
CVE-2010-2074 has been assigned to this issue.
This update also turns on verification of x509 certificates by default
which was not the case before.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- xmlrpc-c
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs
that can occur while processing malformed XML input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,
and Access Control (CWE-264)
- CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Insufficient Information
- CVE-2009-3560: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Buffer Errors (CWE-119)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE11
- XFree86/xorg-x11
X clients could cause a memory corruption in the X Render extension
which crashes the X server (CVE-2010-1166).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3
- yast2-webclient
WebYaST generates the secret key used to create session cookies
after package installation. Since WebYaST appliances use
pre-installed images all such instances end up using the same secret
key (CVE-2010-1507).
Affected Products: SLE11

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

## [gv 3.7.0 released (Security Fix) & Translators wanted](forum.php?forum_id=6368)

*Item posted by [Markus Steinborn <msteinbo>](/users/msteinbo) on Sun 06 Jun 2010 05:12:59 PM UTC.*

I am pleased to announce that GNU gv 3.7.0 has just been released. It is available for download in the GNU ftp, ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gv

Note this release fixes security bugs, so you should update if you are using

GNU gv older than version 3.6.91.

Changes in this version:

* GV 3.6.91 has been released as GV 3.7.0 with no changes but

some minor code cleanups.

# Support starting ghostscript from a safe directory.

# ghostscript is started with -P- if SAFER is enabled.

# ghostscript is started with -dSAFER and -dDELAYSAFER for "pdf2dsc"

  and "pdf2ps" if safer is enabled

# Fixes CVE-2010-2055 and CVE-2010-2056.

# Minor bugfixes

# Fix compiling on Mac OS X

# Support for localised user interfaces

As GNU gv now supports localised user interfaces, I am looking for translators.

See  <https://savannah.gnu.org/people/viewjob.php?group_id=7009&job_id=550> for

details.

| Innovation it is always nice. Glad to learn that this release fixes security bugs. I should update it, cause I was using  GNU gv older than version 3.6.91 got by <http://bytesland.com/view/GNU-Open-Subtitle-Translator-Ahashare>  Something makes me think that I will be satisfied with this new version. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Cheers,  Paul Szabo   psz@maths.usyd.edu.au   <http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/psz/> School of Mathematics and Statistics   University of Sydney    Australia ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=691339#c1)  Hin-Tak Leung    2010-05-26 22:53:54 UTC  ``` AFAIK this is as documented. See doc/Use.htm on the '-P' , '-P-' switches for turning this behavior on and off. This is not new and changing it would upset other people. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=691339#c10)  Ray Johnston    2010-05-27 20:51:19 UTC  ``` Ghostscript makefiles have a macro to make -P- the default.  Set SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=0 on your make line and voila!  See the comments in:  # Define whether or not searching for initialization files should always # look in the current directory first.  This leads to well-known security # and confusion problems, but users insist on it. # NOTE: this also affects searching for files named on the command line: # see the "File searching" section of Use.htm for full details. # Because of this, setting SEARCH_HERE_FIRST to 0 is not recommended.  This comment, and the build macro and -P- flag date back to at least 1997 (the oldest I have readily available -- version 5.03) so this issue, and our cautionary note have been known since then.  The number of ghostscript users has grown, so changing the way that ghostscript finds files at this point would be painful for many users, and unless the comments relate to a way to make this 'painless' for existing users, please cease comments on this bug. The issue is CLOSED !!!  Also, PLEASE make sure you have contacted the maintainers of the clients of ghostscript (gv, cups, etc). to let them know that in your opinion they should be using -P- along with -dSAFER. That way they can also address the need to explicitly specify paths on files they provide as input. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:06:17 UTC  ``` Security flaws were found in the way gs handled its initialization: 1, library search path include '.' (current working directory) by default,    causing ghostscript to search '.' for initialization and library postscript    files 2, explicit use of "-P-" command line option, did not prevent ghostscript from    executing PostScript commands, contained within "gs_init.ps" file.   A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary PostScript commands, if the victim was tricked into opening a PostScript file in the directory writeable by the attacker  References: [1] <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691339> [2] <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691350> [3] <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/511433> [4] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583316> [5] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608071> [6] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583183>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:18:58 UTC  ``` Initial list of packages, shipped within Fedora, which might be affected by this:  1, a2ps 2, asymptote 3, c2050 4, cups 5, cups-pdf 6, dblatex 7, efax 8, evince 9, fig2ps 10, flpsed 11, grace 12, gimp 13, hevea 14, hpijs 15, hpoj 16, kdissert 17, latex-mk 18, latexmk 19, mpage 20, pnm2ppa 21, prosper 22, ps2eps 23, pstoedit 24, scribus 25, texmacs 26, wv 27, xfig 28, xournal 29, xpaint  Above list is currently under investigation, and will be updated later, as soon as more details are available.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:21:59 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 599168](show_bug.cgi?id=599168 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Ghostscript is vulnerable to CVE-2010-2055") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:25:51 UTC  ``` Another list from SUSE's Werner Fink:   [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608071#c23>  to compare against.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c4)  M.

Steinborn    2010-08-25 18:44:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20)) > Wish upstream would release an 8.71.1 for this or something. :-(  Take a look at the upstream repository. They already have tagged ghostscript-9.00 (unless they deleted the tag again).   More related patches from upstream:  11390+11496   Documentation update  11499, 11500, 11510, 11514, 11515: Regression fixes for Patches in [Comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20) and this Comment. They should fix <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c17> and <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c19> (Dunno if I missed a regression fixing patch).   Except 11351 I applied every patch from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20) and #21 (11532 needs backporting to 8.71), it's working fine for me.  Furthermore I made "-dSAFER" the default for ghostscript on my system. Please consider making that, too.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-26 08:43:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20)) > 11351: > Adding -P- and -dSAFER to many POSIX shell scripts, win32 and OS/2 batch scr  We won't really care about -P- part if the default is changed.  Most script already use -dSAFER, no objections to making consistent across all scripts.  > 11352: > observe minst->search_here_first condition in file search; [bug 691350](show_bug.cgi?id=691350)  That should be the patch to fix broken -P-, not too well described in 2, in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c0).   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c23)  Tim Waugh    2010-08-26 15:26:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c21)) > More related patches from upstream: >  > 11390+11496   Documentation update  Already have that one.  > 11499, 11500, 11510, 11514, 11515: Regression fixes for Patches in [Comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20) > and this Comment.  Several of these fails to apply to 8.71.  As for -dSAFER, I'd rather stick more closely to upstream.  I agree that -dSAFER should be the default, but this is something that the ghostscript developers should change (and test...).   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c24)  Tim Waugh    2010-10-25 15:52:12 UTC  ``` pdfmerge needs to be changed to use -P (or -I.) as it intentionally reads files from the current directory.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: ghostscript security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0095)

## Topic

Updated ghostscript packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ghostscript is a set of software that provides a PostScript interpreter, a
set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library, which implements the graphics
capabilities in the PostScript language) and an interpreter for Portable
Document Format (PDF) files.

An integer overflow flaw was found in Ghostscript's TrueType bytecode
interpreter. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript or PDF
file that, when interpreted, could cause Ghostscript to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2009-3743)

It was found that Ghostscript always tried to read Ghostscript system
initialization files from the current working directory before checking
other directories, even if a search path that did not contain the current
working directory was specified with the "-I" option, or the "-P-" option
was used (to prevent the current working directory being searched first).
If a user ran Ghostscript in an attacker-controlled directory containing a
system initialization file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary
PostScript code. (CVE-2010-2055)

Ghostscript included the current working directory in its library search
path by default. If a user ran Ghostscript without the "-P-" option in an
attacker-controlled directory containing a specially-crafted PostScript
library file, it could cause Ghostscript to execute arbitrary PostScript
code. With this update, Ghostscript no longer searches the current working
directory for library files by default. (CVE-2010-4820)

Note: The fix for CVE-2010-4820 could possibly break existing
configurations. To use the previous, vulnerable behavior, run Ghostscript
with the "-P" option (to always search the current working directory
first).

A flaw was found in the way Ghostscript interpreted PostScript Type 1 and
PostScript Type 2 font files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
PostScript Type 1 or PostScript Type 2 font file that, when interpreted,
could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2010-4054)

Users of Ghostscript are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

(Please note that the email address pszwt@maths.usyd.edu.au that I used to file this bug is normally NOT monitored. Please use my "real" address psz@maths.usyd.edu.au for any correspondence.)  Cheers, Paul  Paul Szabo   psz@maths.usyd.edu.au   <http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/psz/> School of Mathematics and Statistics   University of Sydney    Australia ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c1)  Ray Johnston    2010-05-30 04:15:08 UTC  ``` Well, you are right. The startup code has a rather unfortunate mode of 'search_with_no_combine' when gs_main_lib_open calls lib_file_open: ------------------------------------------------------------------------     bool starting_arg_file = (i_ctx_p == NULL) ? true :                i_ctx_p->starting_arg_file;     bool search_with_no_combine = false; ---SNIP---     if (gp_file_name_is_absolute(fname, flen)) {        search_with_no_combine = true;        search_with_combine = false;     } else {        search_with_no_combine = starting_arg_file;        search_with_combine = true;     }     if (search_with_no_combine) {         uint blen1 = blen;          if (gp_file_name_reduce(fname, flen, buffer, &blen1) !=                    gp_combine_success)             goto skip;         if (iodev_os_open_file(iodev, (const char *)buffer, blen1,                                 (const char *)fmode, &s, (gs_memory_t *)mem) ==              0) ------------------------------------------------------------------------  I guess this is a real bug. At the very least we need to observe the minst->search_here_first condition (as set by the -P- flag), but it is not clear to me that we ever should search without combine, except for the case when gp_file_name_is_absolute( ) returns true. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c2)  Hin-Tak Leung    2010-05-30 09:48:14 UTC  ``` I'll look into this when I finish my travelling. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c5)  Hin-Tak Leung    2010-06-03 17:39:36 UTC  ``` Due to the perceived gravity of the bug, the patch sent out for review a day ago is committed as r11352 . It was tested okay in combination with 691355/691356 before sending out for review: <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691355#c12> <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691356#c5>  Await feedback and possible refinement from other Artifex personnel before closing. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c6)  Hin-Tak Leung    2010-06-17 20:40:24 UTC  ``` r11390 added short paragraph in man page about -P-/-P referring users to Use.htm for details. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c7)  Dr. Werner Fink    2010-06-30 11:48:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6412](attachment.cgi?id=6412 "ghostscript-8.70-gs_init.dif") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6412&action=edit "ghostscript-8.70-gs_init.dif") ghostscript-8.70-gs_init.dif  Suggest at least such a change to protect users against symlink attacks within e.g. /tmp directory.  This is a solution for UNIX based OS, don't know about Windows[tm]. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c8)  Hin-Tak Leung    2010-07-01 01:09:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6419](attachment.cgi?id=6419&action=diff "A slightly more portable version of ghostscript-8.70-gs_init.dif") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6419&action=edit "A slightly more portable version of ghostscript-8.70-gs_init.dif") A slightly more portable version of ghostscript-8.70-gs_init.dif  A slightly more portable version of ghostscript-8.70-gs_init.dif, committed as r11468.  Thanks for the patch - I added a define and a comment about windows portability. Not sure how this patch works under the emulated group/world permission on cygwin on non-ACL win98/ME. It probably works but either way it is not important, as cygwin users can always run the native binary.  BTW, MS VC9 is freely available and works alright under wine with the little effort (<http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21394>). For obviously unix-specific patches in the future like ghostscript-8.70-gs_init.dif, please make an effort to see to what extent it is non-portable. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c9)  Alex Cherepanov    2010-07-07 18:40:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 6441](attachment.cgi?id=6441&action=diff "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=6441&action=edit "patch") patch  Don't search for initialization files in the current directory first by default because this leads to well-known security and confusion problems.

Here's the relevant section of the comment:  The problem is that with the -P- default condition (SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=0), the 'lib_file_open' logic gets called in order to load the file from Resource/Encoding/Wingdings) and ends up taking the path at zfile.c:1009 that sets search_with_no_combine = starting_arg_file; search_with_combine = true; and since 'starting_arg_file' is now 0 (because of the -P- default) it does not allow 'search_with_no_combine'.  Since GS_LIB=Resource/Init:lib it checks for the existence of: "Resource/Init/Resource/Encoding/Wingdings" "lib/Resource/Encoding/Wingdings" and various other GS_LIB_DEFAULT paths.  Thus when -P- is the default (or SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=0 in the makefile), we cannot find Resource files when the GenericResourceDir ends up as a relative path (non-absolute).  Note that setting -sGenericResourceDir=Resource/ or ./Resource/ also does not help this -- the file name is seen as not absolute, so does also only searches for file names prepended with the lib paths.  Setting an absolute path works fine for me. ---SNIP--- This raises concern about the decision to make SEARCH_HERE_FIRST=0 as the default for the future. It may cause a lot of folks to have problems accessing Resource files when COMPILE_INITS=0 ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c17)  Ray Johnston    2010-07-10 21:23:39 UTC  ``` Some of the points to consider on this:  1. While GS_LIB=Resource/Init (or GS_LIB=./Resource/Init) works for finding    the init files, it does not automatically generate a valid default    GenericResourceDir since without -P (or -I.) Resource files cannot be    opened.  2. Without -P or -I. -sGenericResourceDir must be set to an absolute path    (even if the LIBPATH paths include relative paths).  3. When GenericResourceDir is set to a non-absolute path with -P- in effect,    whether set by -sGenericResourceDir or by the 'default setting' code in    gs_res.ps, it does not warn that the path is not valid. The testing in    gs_res.ps doesn't use the same algorithm as ResourceFileStatus does:     pssystemparams dup /GenericResourceDir get exch /GenericResourcePathSep get    Init) exch (gs_init.ps) concatstrings concatstrings concatstrings     status { ...  I am really unsure about the wisdom of changing the default behavior. If linux distros wish to do this (to address security concerns raised by this bug), they can do so, AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TESTING AND/OR CHANGING ANY SCRIPTS that break as a result. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c18)  Dr. Werner Fink    2010-07-12 07:45:02 UTC  ``` @Ray:  It is a simple security risk to allow reading configuration files        from the working directory.  Think about /tmp or /var/tmp and        a modified gs_init.ps ... or a simply tar or zip archive including        such a modified gs_init.ps.  With this any user of gs will become        an attack victim.  Maybe the search scheme should be able to detect        if a file is part of the tree below /usr/share/ghostscript/<version>        and accept any path below this even if not explicitly mentioned in        the default GS_LIB path.         For glibc based systems the way could be the clibc function call        realpath(3) which is declared for (_BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500)        with the real path of /usr/share/ghostscript/<version> in comparision        to any real path of a configuration file it is possible to determine        if the last one is below to the first one. ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c19)  Ray Johnston    2010-08-08 16:09:17 UTC  ``` Now that Alex has fixed the logic to set the default GenericResourceDir and ICCProfilesDir values and insure that these directories are readable whether they are in the %rom% file system or on disk, the builds seem to work fine both in the default case (equivalent to the old -P- case) and with -P, also with a -I added and deriving the default directories from there.  Closing as fixed. Note that the only way the default directory (.) will be used now is if it is compiled into gs (which is no longer the default), or if a user wants it to by including -P or by including a -I relative path.  All of this was completed by patches up to rev 11515.  Thanks for all of your work on this, Alex. ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c20)  Till Kamppeter    2010-08-08 17:07:09 UTC  ``` Also reported to Ubuntu and Debian, see  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/gs-gpl/+bug/605211](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gs-gpl/%2Bbug/605211) ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c21)  Ray Johnston    2010-08-09 00:36:32 UTC  ``` -dSAFER will not be the default for rev 9.00. This parameter has been available for several years and it is up to those that invoke Ghostscript with PS files to take adequate precautions.  PDF has become dominant and doesn't have the general file control capability that -dSAFER protects against.  Not that we don't recommend that folks use -dSAFER, we just want to make sure that those that expect the current behavior to be surprised. ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c22)  daihan    2010-10-19 05:30:29 UTC  ``` Hi Werner,Ray,  Could you provide a patch which includes complete fix for this bug? I'm supporting products which use ghostscipt 8.71 and not sure what modification should apply.  Appreciate your help very much!  Thanks, Han ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Date: Thu, 27 May 2010 14:31:27 +1000
```
I have been using a wrapper around gs that sets both -P- -dSAFER.
That seems to work fine for viewing PS files, but does NOT allow
gv to work for PDFs: the (first?) invoked gs cannot have either of
those "security options" when attempting "gv some.pdf".

As with PS files, "gv /tmp/some.pdf" first does "chdir /tmp" then
invokes gs, which is rather unsafe without -P-.

I slightly wonder about the writing of the tmp file
  open("/tmp/gv_random_some.pdf.tmp", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666)
from within gs (no O_EXCL so would follow a symlink allowing clobber).

It is not for gs to verify the security of the tmp file passed as
argument (it cannot do that), but gv should pre-create the file in
a safe way.

I guess this issue can be exploited remotely.

If /etc/mailcap uses gs, then we are done: neither -P- nor -dSAFER are
defaults.

My Debian /etc/mailcap uses gv, and gv knows to use -dSAFER. First
"feed" the victim a "bad" PS file named gs_res.ps or pdf_base.ps or
similar. No harm done yet. Then "feed" the victim any PS or PDF file:
quite likely the old file will have its original name, still in place,
in the same place as the new file: gv does not use -P- and our first
file will be used.

Would it help if I (or someone with actual knowledge) would put together
a proof-of-concept demo?

I guess the reason why it changes the directory and why -P- is not
working here is that the pdf is opened by some postscript code and will
not find it with relative path.

There seems explicit code in gv to make sure that filename is always
relative which has a comment:
"/* Strip off directory from p to satisfy GS 8.00 security change */"

I wonder what that is about...

And it's really quite annoying that gs seems to have no option to add .
in the search path after everything else.

Both are introduced by the commit

commit c135e449c8aa5f08a6931355adc9f9704bde7fea
Author: Jose E. Marchesi <jemarch@gnu.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 31 12:14:09 2005 +0000

    Applied the gs 8.0 SAFE patch from John Bowman

Therefore there is reason to believe that both, the chdir and the
relative filename are needed for ghostscript 8.0.

By adjusting the settings in "State - Ghostscript options", you can add
the requested "-P-" quite easy: Add "-P-" to arguments and to the
beginning of "Scan PDF" and "Convert PDF". Let's start with this and
test if this breaks something.

PS: If using a wrapper for calling "gs", make sure that "-P-" is added
to the beginning of the parameters, not at the end. That may be a cause
why GNU gv does not work with a wrapper.

I cannot find a problem there. GNU gv creates the file as follows:

(ps.c, psscan()):  filename_dsc=file_getTmpFilename(NULL,filename_raw);
where getTmpFilename itself uses mkstemp to create the file (assuming
mkstemp is available on your system, which is the case on GNU/Linux).
Have verified that the permissions are 600 after getTmpfilename().

Yes that is what I do:

#!/usr/bin/perl --
#...
$c = $0;
$c =~ s/.*\///;
exec "/usr/bin/$c", '-P-', '-dSAFER', @ARGV;

and my testing suggested it breaks gv.

Well, the DSC parsing seems to be "-dSAFER"-incompatible. But with the
following settings I can open ps and pdf files - and pdf to postscript
conversion has sucessfully been tested on an example.

$ cat .gv
GV.gsArguments:         -P- -dFIXEDMEDIA
GV.antialias:           False
GV.infoVerbose:         All
GV.gsInterpreter:       gs
!GV.saveposFilename:    ~/test.gv
GV*international:               False
GV.version:             gv 3.6.7.90

GV.gsCmdConvPDF:        gs -P- -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH
-sDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=%s -f %s -c save pop quit
GV.gsCmdScanPDF:        gs -P- -dNODISPLAY -dQUIET -sPDFname=%s
-sDSCname=%s %s pdf2dsc.ps -c quit

So "-P-" may work with GNU gv - but some testing would help before
changing the defaults.

BTW: I have done my test with ghostscript 8.71.

Sorry, but my ltrace or strace shows otherwise: gv does NOT use mkstemp,
gv does NOT open the file but gs does. (Thankfully gv seems to set a sane
"umask 077" before invoking gs.)

If gv used mkstemp as you say, opening and pre-creating the file as I
suggested, then things would be "right".

Looking at the commit that introduced removing the path name, I think
adding -dDELAYSAFER (or something like that, take a look at the commit)
might be better than removing -dSAFER, assuming it still works...

Well, that may be explained that debian lenny is shipped with a rather
old version of GNU gv.
As upstream maintainer, I did my test with an up to date verasion of GNU
gv (because that is what I need for the development of GNU gv).

The following commit contains the fix (you see it is rather old):

commit a17416c462e5b6c9cc7c98c5ea01f580152f2da9
Author: Markus Steinborn <gnugv_maintainer@yahoo.de>
Date:   Sat Jul 19 16:21:35 2008 +0000

    Use mkstemp for getting the temporary filename if available

Perhaps these changes may be packported by debian (if you know debian
stable you know about the changes that lenny will get an up to date GNU
gv, so backporting looks like the only option. ).

That patch applies to GNU gv 3.6.5 with some fuzz but well (except for
the update of the Changelog, but that should not be a problem).

Well, then I can close the bug upstream. But for debian, it has to be
kept open - as lenny is vulnerable.

Addendum: Of cause only the part of the original bug report that
addresses file handling, not the options "-P-", "-dSAFE" and related.

First test works... Bit I would feel much better if we could test these
settings before changing the default settings.

Would it be possible to give the "unsafe" gs invocations an explicit
-dNOSAFER or somesuch argument, to override whatever I may set in my
wrapper, and to handle gs changing their defaults to secure settings?

I will try to dig up the file I was testing with, and re-do the tests.
My vague memory is that the layout of the two-page-per-sheet file
changed with -P-.

Something does completely wrong (__not__ running debian):

msteinbo@acer:/tmp/2>cp  /usr/share/cups/data/testprint.ps .
msteinbo@acer:/tmp/2>touch gs_init.ps
msteinbo@acer:/tmp/2>gs -P- -dSAFER testprint.ps

an integer.
msteinbo@acer:/tmp/2>gs -P- -dSAFER -dPARANOIDSAGER testprint.ps
GPL Ghostscript 8.71: Initialization file gs_init.ps does not begin with
an integer.

Of cause, without the empty "gs_init.ps", it works. What does this test
do on debian?

May have something to do with:

I realized that, too. I've written two mails to <http://bugs.debian.org/58183>:
Ghostscript seems to simply ignore the -P- option (or rather does
something, but without any effect).

Anyone has a ghostscript bugzilla account and wants to report this?

Attached patch is what I plan to use in an package targeted
at stable-security I hope to have ready soon.

Instead of trying to use -P- (which currently does not work
anyway) with all the complexity of guessing where to add it
if the commands are taken from some user config file, it just
changes to an empty directory befor calling gs.

Sounds good... except:

I do not see where /usr/lib/gv/safe-gs-workdir is created.

I would prefer to check it actually is empty... pure paranoia, is
root-owned so is unlikely to change. Name it "please-keep-empty" maybe?

It's done in debian/rules so that not makefiles have to be changed.
(and it's /usr/share/gv/safe-gs-workdir btw).

Someone might actuall want to put stuff. Anf putting unsafe stuff in
a directory called safe-gs-workdir is nothing I guess a normal person
will do...

Please see

I am not convinced that my "security wrapper" protects in all cases,
or that it does not prevent some "safe" usage.

Referring to:
  <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691316>
  <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/511433>

I see that at gs tries many files in (under) current directory
at startup, so it is dangerous to do e.g.
  cd /tmp; gs any.ps

To see list of files that gs tries, use:
  strace -omylog gs; grep '"\./' mylog | sort -u

I now use a security wrapper (attached), to protect.

  <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691339>
told me to use the -P- switch, and marked it "RESOLVED WONTFIX".

I guess -P- should be the default, as well as -dSAFER should be.

I guess this issue can be exploited remotely.

If /etc/mailcap uses gs, then we are done: neither -P- nor -dSAFER are
defaults.

My Debian /etc/mailcap uses gv, and gv knows to use -dSAFER. First
"feed" the victim a "bad" PS file named gs_res.ps or pdf_base.ps or
similar. No harm done yet. Then "feed" the victim any PS or PDF file:
quite likely the old file will have its original name, still in place,
in the same place as the new file: gv does not use -P- and our first
file will be used.

Would it help if I (or someone with actual knowledge) would put together
a proof-of-concept demo?

When I try in lenny:

/usr/bin/gs -P- test.ps

I get the error message
GPL Ghostscript 8.62: Initialization file gs_init.ps does not begin with

So it looks like it is looking in the current directory even with -P-.

Looking at the code (src/imain.c in lenny, psi/imain.c in unstable) the
code looks like

|    int first_is_here =
|        (r_size(&minst->lib_path.list) != 0 &&
|         paths[0].value.bytes == (const byte *)gp_current_directory_name ? 1 : 0);
|    int code = 0;
|    int count = minst->lib_path.count;
|    int i, have_rom_device = 0;
|
|    if (minst->search_here_first) {
|        if (!(first_is_here ||
|              (r_size(&minst->lib_path.list) != 0 &&
|               !bytes_compare((const byte *)gp_current_directory_name,
|                              strlen(gp_current_directory_name),
|                              paths[0].value.bytes,
|                              r_size(&paths[0]))))
|            ) {
|            memmove(paths + 1, paths, count * sizeof(*paths));
|            make_const_string(paths, avm_foreign | a_readonly,
|                              strlen(gp_current_directory_name),
|                              (const byte *)gp_current_directory_name);
|        }
|    } else {
|        if (first_is_here)
|            memmove(paths, paths + 1, count * sizeof(*paths));
|    }
|    r_set_size(&minst->lib_path.list,
|               count + (minst->search_here_first ? 1 : 0));

With -P- that code seems to be called twice. The first time with
search_here_first still true, the second time time false.

Unless I' mistaken, the r_set_size call is buggy. That looks to do
the wrong thing both when the current dir is already there (dunno why
it does not segfault though, perhaps coincidence) and it does not reduce
the count when the "." should habe been removed again.

Yes, please.

I am following this but really am incapable of solving it myself (and my
fellow maintainers seem missing for quite some time, unfortunately), so
really appreciate all the help I can get!

Further gs issues. The "gs scripts" mentioned below are in /usr/bin:

  bdftops dumphint dvipdf eps2eps font2c gsbj gsdj gsdj500 gslj gslp
  gsnd pdf2dsc pdf2ps pdfopt pf2afm pfbtopfa printafm ps2ascii ps2epsi
  ps2pdf ps2pdf12 ps2pdf13 ps2pdf14 ps2pdfwr ps2ps ps2ps2 wftopfa

(maybe others?).

The "bad code" is a non-issue (but illustrates quality of ghostscript);
the other issues are likely to be execute-any-code, maybe remotely.
Maybe the problems below should be "split" into separate bugs.

---

Missing -P- and -dSAFER in scripts

Bernhard R. Link <brlink@debian.org> noticed that there is no -P- flag
on gs invocations in any gs scripts, many are also missing a -dSAFER.

Reported to ghostscript:
  <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691355>

---

Relative filenames in scripts

Many gs scripts use "auxiliary" PS files. No absolute pathnames are
used, and thus are tried from "current directory" first, leading to
unsafe code execution.

Reported to ghostscript:
  <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691356>

---

Bad code in scripts

Many gs scripts in /usr/bin contain code like:

GS_EXECUTABLE=gs
gs="`dirname $0`/$GS_EXECUTABLE"
if test ! -x "$gs"; then
        gs="$GS_EXECUTABLE"
fi
GS_EXECUTABLE=gs

Surely that last line is meant to be
GS_EXECUTABLE="$gs"
as is on "current" gs distribution. But even then is badly written,
should probably be:

GS_EXECUTABLE=gs
gs="`dirname $0`/$GS_EXECUTABLE"
if test -x "$gs"; then
	GS_EXECUTABLE="$gs"
fi

In the future, please have the decency to consult with debian-devel
before mass-filing bugs.  Also check whether the issue actually
applies to a package before filing a bug against it. We already call
-dSAFER and drop privileges early, so we're already protected as it
is. Closing.

wouldn't it make more sense to solve these issues in the ghostscript
package by itself; rather than 100 different packages.

even if ghostscript won't change their code, debian always has the
option to fix it anyway.  that could be done be either applying a
patch that automatically uses the safer options by default, or by
installing wrapper scripts that the safer options.  fixing 100
different packages is a significant undertaking, and that should be
avoided if there is a simpler approach.

Sorry, you seem to misunderstand: this bug is (more-or-less) about the
need to use the -P- also, as well as -dSAFER, to be protected.

Is cups-pdf "part of" cups? In that case you may be "safe" because of
chdir("/"), see <http://bugs.debian.org/584002> .

I agree, instead of fixing this in every single package using
ghostscript in the archive we should rather patch Ghostscript
to set a proper default.

This also solves the problem for all applications using
Ghostscript not packaged in the archive.

In Scribus we call gs with -dPARANOIDSAFER. Is that sufficient to avoid this

Not sufficient, you need -P- also.

I do not expect "upstream" ghostscript.com (artifex.com) to make -P- the
default, I do not know if Debian will.

(There are other bugs with gs, thus it is unsafe with all those options,
but those are being worked on upstream and should make it into Debian,
eventually.)

Cheers, Paul (noting I am no gs expert, nor Debian maintainer)

        -P- not having any effect

<http://bugs.debian.org/584663>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:06:17 UTC  ``` Security flaws were found in the way gs handled its initialization: 1, library search path include '.' (current working directory) by default,    causing ghostscript to search '.' for initialization and library postscript    files 2, explicit use of "-P-" command line option, did not prevent ghostscript from    executing PostScript commands, contained within "gs_init.ps" file.   A local attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary PostScript commands, if the victim was tricked into opening a PostScript file in the directory writeable by the attacker  References: [1] <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691339> [2] <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691350> [3] <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/511433> [4] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583316> [5] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608071> [6] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583183>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:18:58 UTC  ``` Initial list of packages, shipped within Fedora, which might be affected by this:  1, a2ps 2, asymptote 3, c2050 4, cups 5, cups-pdf 6, dblatex 7, efax 8, evince 9, fig2ps 10, flpsed 11, grace 12, gimp 13, hevea 14, hpijs 15, hpoj 16, kdissert 17, latex-mk 18, latexmk 19, mpage 20, pnm2ppa 21, prosper 22, ps2eps 23, pstoedit 24, scribus 25, texmacs 26, wv 27, xfig 28, xournal 29, xpaint  Above list is currently under investigation, and will be updated later, as soon as more details are available.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:21:59 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 599168](show_bug.cgi?id=599168 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Ghostscript is vulnerable to CVE-2010-2055") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 14:25:51 UTC  ``` Another list from SUSE's Werner Fink:   [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608071#c23>  to compare against.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c4)  M.

They already have tagged ghostscript-9.00 (unless they deleted the tag again).   More related patches from upstream:  11390+11496   Documentation update  11499, 11500, 11510, 11514, 11515: Regression fixes for Patches in [Comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20) and this Comment. They should fix <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c17> and <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691350#c19> (Dunno if I missed a regression fixing patch).   Except 11351 I applied every patch from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20) and #21 (11532 needs backporting to 8.71), it's working fine for me.  Furthermore I made "-dSAFER" the default for ghostscript on my system. Please consider making that, too.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-26 08:43:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20)) > 11351: > Adding -P- and -dSAFER to many POSIX shell scripts, win32 and OS/2 batch scr  We won't really care about -P- part if the default is changed.  Most script already use -dSAFER, no objections to making consistent across all scripts.  > 11352: > observe minst->search_here_first condition in file search; [bug 691350](show_bug.cgi?id=691350)  That should be the patch to fix broken -P-, not too well described in 2, in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c0).   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c23)  Tim Waugh    2010-08-26 15:26:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c21)) > More related patches from upstream: >  > 11390+11496   Documentation update  Already have that one.  > 11499, 11500, 11510, 11514, 11515: Regression fixes for Patches in [Comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c20) > and this Comment.  Several of these fails to apply to 8.71.  As for -dSAFER, I'd rather stick more closely to upstream.  I agree that -dSAFER should be the default, but this is something that the ghostscript developers should change (and test...).   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=599564#c24)  Tim Waugh    2010-10-25 15:52:12 UTC  ``` pdfmerge needs to be changed to use -P (or -I.) as it intentionally reads files from the current directory.
