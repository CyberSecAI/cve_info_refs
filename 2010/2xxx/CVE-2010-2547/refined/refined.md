{
  "CVE-2010-2547": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to reusing a freed pointer when verifying a signature or importing a certificate with many Subject Alternate Names. Specifically, when GPGSM reallocates an array for names, the reallocated array is not assigned to the old array variable, causing the old (and now freed) array to be used.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution.  The vulnerability could allow context-dependent attackers to execute code. In less severe cases, it may lead to a segmentation fault (segv).",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by importing a certificate with more than 98 Subject Alternate Names using GPGSM's import command, or implicitly while verifying a signature. A specially crafted signed message can be used as an attack vector.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious certificate with many 'Subject Alternate Names' (more than 98) to be imported or verified by the target user. This could be done through an email, a website or other vectors where the user might process the malicious certificate."
