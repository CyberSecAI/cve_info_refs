      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Bugzilla": {
      "Description": "Robert Swiecki reported an integer overflow flaw in freetype with how it handles glyphs. This could cause applications linked against freetype to crash or, possibly, lead to the execution of arbitrary code if an attacker were able to get a victim to load a malicious font file. The affected code is not present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (freetype 2.2.1).",
      "Root Cause": "Integer overflow flaw in freetype when handling glyphs.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Integer underflow"
