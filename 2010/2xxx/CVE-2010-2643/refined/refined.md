Root cause of vulnerability:
An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the parser for TFM (TeX Font Metric) font files when processing DVI (Device Independent) files in the GNOME evince document viewer. This occurs due to insufficient checks on an integer value used as the size for a memory allocation, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. Insufficient bounds checking during memory allocation for font parsing. Overwriting a function pointer through heap overflow.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. This can result in a crash, denial of service, or complete compromise of the system.

Attack vectors:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening or previewing a specially crafted DVI file that contains a malicious font. The vulnerability can also be triggered when browsing a folder containing malicious DVI and font files, as the evince thumbnailer will attempt to load the files to generate thumbnails.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious DVI and font files to a user, and the user must attempt to open the file with a vulnerable version of evince or browse to a folder containing the malicious files in a manner that triggers the evince thumbnailer. No specific privileges are required.
