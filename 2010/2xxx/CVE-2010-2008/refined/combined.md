Description:
a user with privileges to run alter database can render entire datadir unusable by causing server to move it into a new sub directory. (binlogs, general log, all data).

How to repeat:
alter database `#mysql50#:` upgrade data directory name;
alter database `#mysql50#.` upgrade data directory name; #crashes debug server

#now look at the datadir...
```

alter database `#mysql50#../` upgrade data directory name;

will move parent of datadir!

Noted in 5.1.48, 5.5.5, 6.0.14 changelogs.

MySQL incorrectly processed ALTER DATABASE `#mysql50#<special>`
UPGRADE DATA DIRECTORY NAME where <special> was ., .., or a sequence
starting with ./ or ../. It used the server data directory (that
contains other regular databases) as the database directory.

Hello everybody,
Everyone can tell me which MySQL release are affected by the ALTER DATABASE bug ?
Just the 5.x or all release from 3.x to 5.1.47

Thanks you for your answer
```

[14 Jul 2010 4:07]
Edward Yang
```
While this is marked a critical security bug, for most MySQL installations the behavior is innocuous: non-administrative users usually only get *.* privileges granted on specific databases, but running ALTER DATABASE `mytable` UPGRADE DATA DIRECTORY, while auth'ed, will not do anything interesting (since there is no #mysql50# prefix). So unless you've explicitly granted *.* privileges to one of the misbehaving database names, or you're worried about users with * privileges DOSing your server (which, if you are, you have much bigger problems), no action is necessary.

Alexandre,

Please look at the "Version:" line at this page header for minimal affected version numbers:

Version:	5.1.46, 5.1.48-bzr, 5.6.99-m4

I.e. 5.0 is not affected, only 5.1+

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
