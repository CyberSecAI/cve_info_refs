Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-2316:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries or returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Input passed through the `search`, `sbr`, `pid`, `sbl`, and `FilePath` parameters in `default.asp`, and `sbr`, `pr`, and `psPrice` parameters in `printpage.asp` are not sanitized, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Input passed through the `search`, `sbr`, `p`, and `sbl` parameters in `default.asp` is not sanitized before being returned to the user, leading to reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and underlying system.
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of XSS can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which could be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the vulnerable parameters (`search`, `sbr`, `pid`, `sbl`, `FilePath`, `pr`, `psPrice`) in the URLs of the `default.asp` and `printpage.asp` pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable URLs and the parameters that are vulnerable.
*   No special privileges or user authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that all versions of WMSCMS are vulnerable.
*   The advisory references a previous Secunia advisory (SA25583) which details XSS issues in 3 parameters, suggesting the issue may have existed previously but was not fully fixed.
*   The advisory provides specific vulnerable URLs and parameters.
