```

The BarnOwl Developers are pleased to announce the release of BarnOwl
version 1.6.2. BarnOwl 1.6.2 is a security release on top of BarnOwl
1.6.1.

It has been installed in the Athena locker, and you can download it
from the website [1] or get the source from Github [2].

BarnOwl 1.6.2 fixes a bug where BarnOwl did not check the return code
from certain libzephyr functions, which could be remotely exploited to
crash BarnOwl or potentially execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2725). This bug affects all previous versions of BarnOwl, as
well as the owl client BarnOwl is based on.

In addition, BarnOwl 1.6.2 improves BarnOwl's handling of its debug
log. In all previous versions of BarnOwl, the debug log, which
contains potentially sensitive data, was written to a
'/var/tmp/owldebug' file with default permissions. BarnOwl 1.6.2
writes to /var/tmp/barnowl.$PID, sets strict permissions, and
otherwise takes appropriate precautions to prevent hijacking of the
log file.

The full Changelog is available online [3].

Thank you for using BarnOwl, and we hope you enjoy the new release. As
usual, any bug reports, questions, or feature requests can be directed
to the developers at <barnowl@mit.edu>.

2.1.12pre Don't crash when sending/logging outgoing  AIM message and not logged in [BZ 90] Don't crash when senging to someone not on AIM buddy list [BZ 94] (patch from Alex Vandiver) 2.1.11 Don't crash doing zlocate with bad tickets. [BZ 12] Metion the path for the owlconf in intro.txt [BZ 54] Print better error message if startup fails due to unreadable .owlconf [BZ 57] In load-subs: Print an error message if the file is unreadable or doesn't exist, UNLESS load-subs is called with no arguments. In that case only print an error if the file exists but isn't readable. Still prints an error either way if zephyr reports a failure. [BZ 19] Fixed some small memory leaks in logging if files unwriteable If the variable logfilter is set it names a filter. Any messages matching this filter are logged. This is an independent mechanism from the other logging variables. If you want to control all logging with logfilter the other variables must be set to their default (off) settings. [BZ 37] Relatively substantial changes made under the hood to support filter logging. Now have more consistent interfaces to creating messages etc. Still needs more work though. Deal gracefully with being resized as small as 1x1 [BZ 3]
2.1.10 Fix a new problem finding libdes425 Don't crash on very long hostnames [BZ 52] In 'sub' command, create .zephyr.subs if it doesn't exist [BZ 15] A fix for certain resize crashes (partly from alexmv) [BZ 55] Turn off ISTRIP (gildea) 2.1.9 Include /usr/include/kerberosIV if it's found 2.1.8 Do OLC formatting for anything coming from olc.matisse Improvements to popup size algorithm (from gildea) Improved 'show colors' with non-colored labels 2.1.7 The colorclass command is added, to make colorization easy Handle MIT Athena OLC zephyrs correctly Updated ktools website / bug address Do ntohs() when printing zephyr port in zephyr info Updated man page 2.1.6 Fixed three bugs found by Valgrind. Fixed a case where doing "aim addbuddy" instead of "addbuddy aim" would cause a segfault. pexec will now incrimentally display data as it is output by the child process. Additionally, commands running under pexec may now be killed by quitting out of the popless window. Added muxevents select loop dispatcher. File descriptors may be registered with muxevents and handlers will be dispatched to when data is available for non-blocking read/write/except. Switched the stderr\_redir stuff to use muxevents. Print C-\ correctly (from gildea) Dropped first brace in muxevents functions for consistency Catch SIGHUP and SIGTERM and do a proper logout 2.1.5 Added a licence The 'personalbell' variable can now be set to 'on' 'off' or the name of a filter to match against The 'loglogins' variable now controls whether login/logout messages are logged. It is off by default. For now this affects only AIM messages, later zephyr login/logout messages will also be logged if this is set to 'on' Added 'show license' 2.1.4 Normalize and downcase AIM names for logging Fixed a bug where sending a null zsig could cause a crash Better 'away' toggling if only one protocol is away.
2.1.3 Added perl filter elements. Similar to having "filter <subfilter>" in a filter, you may also have "perl <functionname>" where <functionname> is passed an owl::Message object and returns 0 or 1 depending on whether the message matches that element of the filter. Don't print an error about loading subs if there is no .zephyr.subs Do the initial zephyr\_buddy\_check when pseduologin set to true. Updated man page 2.1.2 removed unused filter\_depth variable Fixed memory bug on receiving pings 2.1.1 Filters of filters now work. Removed the "possibly not readable" part of the config parsing error In the sepbar, reverse video the view name when it's not set to view\_home (as opposed to the static 'all'). The '!' key (bound to 'view -r') now creates a negative version of the current view and switches to it. i.e. "show me all the messages that are not these" Added the 'ignorelogins' variable Log when outgoing personal message fails Removed file descriptor from sigpipe catcher printer just for now, since the field does not exist on OSX Added an ifndef for socklen\_t in libfaim/ft.c Added the 'aim search' command. The popup on callback may be dangerous, should switch to an admin msg for results, or add a new event queue First pass at AIM away messages. It is a little different from what most clients seem to do, in that an away reply is sent for each message received. Most clients only reply to the first one per away-session. Now have a set of 'aaway' commands and variables just like the 'zaway' ones (except that changing the 'aaway' variable talks to the server) The new 'away' command does everything for both AIM \*and\* zephyr. There is a known funkiness here, where if you turn one away on, and then use 'away' (or 'A') to toggle, you will turn on off and the other on. Just leaving it for now. Should do better in the next patch. The 'A' key is bound to 'away' Status bar can now read AWAY, Z-AWAY or A-AWAY. Changed C-n to scroll down just a line in popless If the config exists but is not readable, print an error before exiting Only print forced AIM logout message once. Don't bind F1 to help in edit context Fix bug in 'getsubs' with no tickets New code for getting users from .anyfile Added the 'pseudologins' variable, and code to do it new attributes 'pseudo' 'logintty' and 'loginhost' Don't print extra new lines in popless\_file New zephyr\_get\_field function 2.0.14 Fixed missing word in startup message Better 'status' command Use '+' for popwin corners when 'fancylines' is off Allow TERMINFO to be overridden in the envrionment Command line arg -D turns on debugging and deletes previous debugging file Do ~ expansion in 'dump' command. Current directory added to 'status' command Massive changes to libfaim and aim 2.0.13 Changed startup message for new mailing list blist now prints AIM info even if .anyone is unreadable Catch SIGPIPE and print an error rather than crashing. [It's possible that this may have some portability  issues under Solaris and we may need to add some  configure stuff around SA\_SIGINFO...] Handle the case in aim\_bstream\_send where aim\_send returns -1, although there is likely an underlying problem here that would lead to this case. Print the username on aim login failure, not something random like the password. ;) Un-word-wrap text when sending AIM messages. Replace the main loop continue in the keyboard handler with an else. 2.0.12 Command history now doesn't allow the last entry to be repeated If format\_msg returns "" print "<unformatted message>" Better align oneline admin and loopback messages Print an admin message indicating when subscriptions can not be loaded on startup Set aim\_ignorelogin\_timer to 15 by default Admin message on login/logout of AIM Fixed double quoting in smartzpunt Added timestamp to login/logout messages Fixed replies to loopback messages Fixed smartnarrow on classes/instances with spaces Added the 'loggingdirection' variable All loopback messages log to 'loopback' now Print an error message if trying an invalid color for a filter Fixed bug causing > not to go to end of editwin every time 2.0.11 Updated basic help Display CC: in outgoing CC messages More AIM logout detection Don't proclaim "interfaces changed" on first build. Added the 'loopback' message type Added the 'loopwrite' command Added a timestamp to the default style Zpunt now works with weird regex characters Smart filters now work with weird regex characters 2.0.10 Allow 'hostname' in filters. Fixed bug in reporting when no one is subbed to a class Added an extral newline in logging incoming zephyrs An admin message is displayed when you are logged out of AIM Print an error message and admin message if an AIM send fails 2.0.9 Added the 'fancylines' variable. Added the 'show startup' command. Added feature for capturing stderr messages from commands and displaying them in the errors buffer. Create an admin message explaning that a zephyr couldn't be sent Better reporting of perl errors (both into the errqueue and also clearing the error after displaying it). Allow default\_style to be specified in config. Added errqueue Added command "show errors" Fixed bug removing newlines in backup files 2.0.8 Increased size of screen name field in buddy listing Fixed bug with idle times causing broken pipes. New libfaim Added the 'source' command. Make sure that a newline is always at the end of messages returned by perl style formatting functions. Add owl::login and owl::auth to legacy variables populated for format\_msg. Additions to intro.txt and advanced.txt documents. (Still in progress.) Add base methods for login\_host and login\_tty  and others that return undef. New API for perl message formatting functions.  Legacy variables are still supported for owl::format\_msg and owl::receive\_msg, but these functions are now also  passed an owl::Message object which contains methods for accessing the contents of the message. See perlwrap.pm  (and docs TBD) for the available methods. \*\*\* WARNING: The exact API for owl::Message has \*\*\* not yet stabilized. Added "style" command for creating new styles. Usage: style <name> perl <function\_name> Added support for "show styles". Changed global style table from list to dictionary. Changed AIM password prompt from "Password:" to "AIM Password:". Messages are reformatted after a window resize to allow styles to take into account the width of the window. When perl throws an error, the message is put in the msgwin if possible. Added perl functions for:  owl::getcurmsg() -- returns an owl::Message object for the active message in the current view. owl::getnumcols() -- returns the column width of the window owl::zephyr\_getrealm() -- returns the zephyr realm owl::zephyr\_getsender() -- returns the zephyr sender Made owl::COMMAND("foo"); be syntactic sugar for  owl::command("COMMAND foo"); Added perlwrap.pm to contain perl code to be compiled into  the binary. This is transformed into perlwrap.c by encapsulate.pl. Renamed readconfig.c to perlconfig.c and changed variables accordingly. Minor bugfixes in cmd.c and commands.c Improved intro doc
2.0.7 Idletimes now appear in the buddylisting Failed AIM logins are now correctly reported Owl will build now without zephyr, enabling it to act as a standalone AIM client. There is now a zcrypt command Replies to zcrypted messages now work Don't allow zwrite if zephyr isn't present Cleaned up some warnings from linux gcc. Fixed bug that can cause response stuff to crash Improved status command Fixed bug in buddy stuff 2.0.6 aimlogin will now accept the screenname without a password and ask for the password such that it is not echo'd to the terminal 'addbuddy aim' and 'delbuddy aim' now work Bug fix to make zwrite -m work with -c/-i Fixed documentation bug in aimwrite Initialze $owl::auth Fix in autoconf for des425 Reformatted editwin.c and added capability of doing password-style echoing 2.0.5 Fix in finding des for building zcrypt Fixed description for alert\_action variable More detailed usage from -h Special cased replies for webzephyr users on classes and login notifications for webzephyr users Fixed bug that caused a crash on zpunt with '\*' for an instance AIM logout and then login now works. Fixed bug causing view -d not to work. Added hostname and tty name to LOGIN/LOGOUT zephyrs on oneline style 2.0.4 Made command line option -n actually work Implemented styles, including the 'default' 'basic' and 'oneline' styles. A 'perl' style is available if a format\_msg() function is found in .owlconf Added the 'default\_style' variable Added the 'toggle-oneline' command The 'o' key is bound to 'toggle-oneline' Internally, the one view now has a name, 'main', and message recalcuations are done in place when its filter is changed. Added filter field 'login' which can take the values 'login' 'logout' or 'none' Added the perl variable $owl::login, just as above Updated the 'login' and 'trash' filters appropriately Fix for checking for DES in build system Bug fix in using makemsg when no curses window is present The variable $owl::auth now exists in perl Use new internal function to delete zephyr subs from file New 'sepbar\_disable' variable can turn off sepbar info display Updated contributor info Added the 'show view' command Bug fix in owl\_regex Fixed personal aim messages logging to class directory Log "LOGIN" or "LOGOUT" for AIM buddy messages zwrite -m now correctly displays an outgoing message and logs zwrite -s now works Strip spaces in AIM usernames on aimwrite send Removed libfaim/config.log from CVS Fixed some easy fixed-length buffers Wordwrap incoming AIM messages Fixed bug causing buddies not to be added to buddy list during ingorelogin timer Translate &lt; &gt; &amp; &quot; &nbsp; &ensp, &emsp, &endash and &emdash 2.0.3 Don't ring the terminal bell on mail messages. Nuke <FONT> Make the build work a little better on OSX Fixed a bug in fmtext Expanded the size of the hostname buffer 2.0.2 Fixed bug in 'startup' command.
2.0.1 Moved newmsgproc stuff to a function procedure Added the 'newlinestrip' variable, on by default, that strips leading and trailing newlines from incoming messages. Fixed a case sensitivity probelm in owl\_message\_is\_personal and owl\_message\_is\_private The message object now uses a list of attributes internally, in prep. for supporting new messaging protocols owl\_function\_info now uses fmtext instead of one staticly sized buffer in owl\_message\_get\_cc() require that the colon be present after cc. Added some defenses against resize crashes, and put in debug messages if they're encountered In filters 'true' and 'false' are now valid tokens. The 'all' filter has been redefinied to be 'true' and there is a 'none' filter defined as 'false'[View remainder of file in raw view](https://github.com/barnowl/barnowl/raw/refs/tags/barnowl-1.6.2/ChangeLog)
