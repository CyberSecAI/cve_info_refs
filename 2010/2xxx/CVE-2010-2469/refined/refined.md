      "source": "www.slideshare.net_1412abc7_20250125_123529.html",
      "root_cause": "The presentation discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the S2 Security NetBox, an Electronic Door Access Controller (EDAC). These include the use of outdated and vulnerable software components, cleartext protocols, and unauthenticated access to sensitive data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of the GoAhead web server, which has multiple known CVEs (CVE-2003-1568, CVE-2002-2431, CVE-2002-2430, CVE-2002-2429, CVE-2002-2428, CVE-2002-1951).",
        "Outdated MySQL server (version 4.0), which is no longer supported.",
        "Use of cleartext protocols like FTP and Telnet for management and backups.",
         "Unauthenticated access to reset functionality.",
         "Unauthenticated access to database backups.",
         "Predictable naming convention for backup files.",
         "Storing of sensitive data like admin password hashes, IP camera credentials, and DVR credentials in the database.",
         "Poor setup guides that recommend using default credentials for DVRs.",
         "Lack of secure deployment guides."
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation allows attackers to gain full control of the EDAC, including opening doors, accessing and controlling IP cameras and DVRs. The attacker can also obtain sensitive information, potentially leading to further compromise of the system and physical security breaches.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the EDAC.",
        "Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the web server.",
         "Exploitation of unauthenticated reset functionality.",
         "Access to database backups via predictable file names and paths."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have network access to the EDAC. This could be achieved through a compromised network, or potentially through the internet if the device is exposed. Further exploitation requires knowledge of the vulnerabilities and access to the backup files."
