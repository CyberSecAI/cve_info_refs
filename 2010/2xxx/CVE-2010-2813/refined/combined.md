## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0103)

## Topic

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail
performed the sanitization of HTML style tag content. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) message that, when opened by a victim, would lead to
arbitrary web script execution in the context of their SquirrelMail
session. (CVE-2011-2023)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. A
remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to execute arbitrary web
script in the context of a victim's SquirrelMail session. (CVE-2010-4555)

An input sanitization flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled the
content of various HTML input fields. A remote attacker could use this
flaw to alter user preference values via a newline character contained in
the input for these fields. (CVE-2011-2752)

It was found that the SquirrelMail Empty Trash and Index Order pages did
not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into SquirrelMail, into
visiting a specially-crafted URL, the attacker could empty the victim's
trash folder or alter the ordering of the columns on the message index
page. (CVE-2011-2753)

SquirrelMail was allowed to be loaded into an HTML sub-frame, allowing a
remote attacker to perform a clickjacking attack against logged in users
and possibly gain access to sensitive user data. With this update, the
SquirrelMail main frame can only be loaded into the top most browser frame.
(CVE-2010-4554)

A flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A
user preference file was created when attempting to log in with a password
containing an 8-bit character, even if the username was not valid. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk
space on the target SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2010-2813)

A flaw was found in the SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plug-in. If an
administrator enabled this plug-in, a SquirrelMail user could use this flaw
to port scan the local network the server was on. (CVE-2010-1637)

Users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=720693#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-12 14:18:51 UTC  ``` It was found that SquirrelMail webmail client did not properly handle generation of a particular web page HTML Header in cases, when entire application was loaded in separated HTML frame, potentially overloading other HTML elements on top of SquirrelMail's user interface. A remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain access to sensitive user data (passwords for example).  Upstream advisory: [1] <http://www.squirrelmail.org/security/issue/2011-07-12>  Relevant upstream patch: [2] <http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail?view=revision&revision=14117>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=720693#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-12 14:21:20 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the squirrelmail package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  --  This issue affects the version of the squirrelmail package, as present within EPEL-6 repository. Please schedule an update.  --  This issue affects the versions of the squirrelmail package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15.

Vulnerability  : No user-specific token implemented
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 543818
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-2964 CVE-2010-2813

SquirrelMail, a webmail application, does not employ a user-specific token
for webforms. This allows a remote attacker to perform a Cross Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attack. The attacker may hijack the authentication of
unspecified victims and send messages or change user preferences among other
actions, by tricking the victim into following a link controled by the
offender.

In addition, a denial-of-service was fixed, which could be triggered when a
passwords containing 8-bit characters was used to log in (CVE-2010-2813).

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny3.1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.21-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=618096#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-07-26 06:16:26 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail processed random login attempts with 8-bit characters in the password. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the server system potentially to run out of the hard disk space via random login attempts, causing SquirrelMail temporarily to accept the login and create a preferences file for the given username.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=618096#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-07-26 06:16:26 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail processed random login attempts with 8-bit characters in the password. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the server system potentially to run out of the hard disk space via random login attempts, causing SquirrelMail temporarily to accept the login and create a preferences file for the given username.
