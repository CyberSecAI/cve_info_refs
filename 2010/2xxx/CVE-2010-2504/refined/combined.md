## Description

Splunk has released critical maintenance releases and a patch to address several vulnerabilities in Splunk versions 4.0 through 4.1.1. At the time of this announcement, Splunk is not aware of any cases where any of these vulnerabilities have been exploited.

Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Splunk strongly recommends that all instances of Splunk running the Splunk Web component be updated immediately to the newest maintenance release.

If you are unable to perform an immediate upgrade, Splunk strongly recommends that you immediately apply a critical patch to all affected versions of Splunk running Splunk Web to address the most serious vulnerability.

Splunk also recommends that you apply as many components of the Splunk Hardening Standards as possible to mitigate the risk and impact of exploitation.

## Products and Components Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this critical maintenance release and patch affect the following versions of Splunk running the Splunk Web component:

* Splunk 4.0 through 4.0.10
* Splunk 4.1 through 4.1.1

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this critical maintenance release and patch affect the Splunk Web component of the Splunk server software. Splunk Web refers to the web server used to deliver the Splunk user interface to the client browser. By default, Splunk light forwarders disable Splunk Web and are not affected.

## Upgrades and Patches

Due to the threat posed by the possibility of a successful attack, Splunk strongly recommends that all instances of Splunk running the Splunk Web component be updated immediately to the newest maintenance release.

**Splunk Version Recommendation Option 2**

* 4.0 to 4.0.10 Upgrade to version 4.0.11 Apply the critical security patch
* 4.1 to 4.1.1 Upgrade to version the latest version of Splunk Apply the critical security patch

Splunk releases are cumulative, meaning that releases posted subsequent to those we are posting today will contain these fixes to these vulnerabilities as well as new features and fixes to other bugs and flaws.

If you are unable to perform an upgrade, Splunk strongly recommends that you apply a critical patch to all versions of Splunk running Splunk Web immediately. However, the patch supplied will only mitigate the most critical vulnerability issued in this announcement, Directory traversal in Splunk Web (SPL-31194).

Splunk recommends that customers only apply the patch as a last resort, in situations where they are unable to upgrade immediately.
