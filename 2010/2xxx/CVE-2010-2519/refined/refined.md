In sigsegv26.ttf, the final fragment sets rlen to 0, and  \"rlen -= 2\" causes underflow for unsigned long value. It makes FT_Stream_Read() failed, because rlen is almost about ULONG_MAX. \n\nThe case of sigsegv27.ttf is slightly different,  its rlen is 0xFFFFFFFF and flag is 0x0000.\n\nThe fix involves checking the fragment length 'rlen' before subtracting 2 and also ignoring segments with flag set to 0x00.\n\nThe vulnerability can cause a crash (SIGSEGV) due to invalid parameters to memcpy() in FT_Stream_ReadAt()."
