Hi,
two security issues have been disclosed in mapserver which need CVE ids:

<http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/3484>
<http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/3485>

Can anyone please allocate two ids?

Cheers
Nico

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=617312#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-07-22 18:49:43 UTC  ``` MapServer upstream during a security audit of MapServer v5.6 source code found a potential buffer overflow in the way MapServer generated unique temporary filenames. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct denial of service attacks.
