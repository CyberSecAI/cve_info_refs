Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-2741:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Windows OpenType Font (OTF) format driver.
*   The driver improperly performs integer calculations when processing specially crafted OpenType fonts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Integer Calculation:** The OTF driver fails to correctly perform integer calculations when handling specially crafted OpenType fonts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, granting them complete control over the affected system.
*   **System Control:** This could enable an attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability. It cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
*   **Specially Crafted Fonts:**  The attack involves using specifically crafted OpenType font files. The vulnerability is triggered when a user views content rendered using these malicious fonts.
*   **Third-Party Browsers:** Third-party web browsers that natively render OTF are also vulnerable, and could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visits a malicious website with an embedded malicious font.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** An attacker must have valid user credentials to log on to the affected system.
*   **Local Access:** Physical or remote access to the system, as the exploit requires running a specially crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not related to remote attacks or anonymous users.
*   The provided Microsoft documents confirm that Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are affected, while later Windows versions such as Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 are not.
*   Avaya products using affected operating systems could be vulnerable, with recommendations to apply the Microsoft patches provided.
*   The vulnerability was privately reported and had no known public exploitation at the time of the security bulletin's release.
*   Microsoft recommends customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.
