Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2349

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Boundary condition error in the H264WebCam software's HTTP server. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request with an overly long string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Boundary Condition Error:** The HTTP server component of H264WebCam does not properly handle overly long input strings in the GET request. This leads to a buffer overflow when processing the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the vulnerability leads to the termination of the H264WebCam's HTTP server process, causing a denial of service. The application becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is launched over the network by sending a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the system running the vulnerable H264WebCam software.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send custom crafted HTTP GET requests containing a large string.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require prior authentication or special permissions.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit code provided shows how the vulnerability can be triggered:

1.  A large string of "A" characters (represented by `BOF`) is generated.
2.  A GET request is constructed with this large string inserted in the URI part of the HTTP request.
3.  The crafted GET request is repeatedly sent to the target system.
4.  The vulnerable H264WebCam server process crashes after processing this malicious request.

**Vulnerable Software and Versions:**
*   **Software:** H264WebCam
*   **Affected Version:** 3.7
*   **Platforms:** Windows 98/Me/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/NT

**Additional Notes**
* The provided exploit code is written in C and is designed to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* There was no fix available at the time of the advisory.
* The exploit was tested on Windows using the Cygwin console.
