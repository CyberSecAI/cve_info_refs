Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2922

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `default.asp` file of the AKY Blog application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `default.asp` file is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (`sifre` field in the `aky_ayarlar` table) as demonstrated in the exploit.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on database permissions and the application's logic, further malicious activities might be possible beyond data exfiltration, such as data modification or even complete takeover of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request targeting the `default.asp` file.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable AKY Blog application.
- No specific privileges are needed, and the attack can be performed remotely.

**Technical Details:**
- A `UNION SELECT` SQL injection is used to extract the `sifre` (password) field from the `aky_ayarlar` table.
- The injection point is the `id` parameter within the `default.asp` file
- Example vulnerable URL:
`http://www.site.com/default.asp?islem=devami&id=38%20union+select+all+0,sifre,2,3%20,4,5+from+aky_ayarlar`
