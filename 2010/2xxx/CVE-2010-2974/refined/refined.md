{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UnsubscribeData method of the IConfigurationAccess interface in the Invensys Wonderware Archestra ConfigurationAccessComponent ActiveX control uses wcscpy() to copy its first parameter into a static sized local buffer, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or cause the web browser to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted HTML content to the victim and convince the victim to open it in a web browser that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control."
