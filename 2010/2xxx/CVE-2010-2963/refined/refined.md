    "vulnerability": "CVE-2010-2963",
    "description": "The ioctl32 v4l1 compat code for VIDIOCSMICROCODE does not check the destination buffer for a copy_from_user() call, which allows anyone with access to a v4l device to write to arbitrary kernel memory locations.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the absence of bounds checking in the v4l1 compat code during a `copy_from_user()` operation when handling the `VIDIOCSMICROCODE` ioctl.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing bounds check",
      "Use of unchecked destination buffer pointer",
      "32-bit compatibility layer vulnerability on 64-bit systems"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary kernel memory write, leading to potential privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to a video device (`/dev/video*`)",
      "Use of ioctl with VIDIOCSMICROCODE"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Local access to a video device on a 64 bit system.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability exists within the 32-bit compatibility layer for the VIDIOCSMICROCODE IOCTL (Input/Output Control) in the Video4Linux implementation.",
       "The `video_code` structure, allocated on the kernel stack, is not initialized before use in the vulnerable copy operation.",
      "It does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 because it does not provide support for the Stradis driver which uses the vulnerable compat code.",
       "The vulnerability was introduced in kernel commit eb4eeccc.",
       "The public demo is available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLxpae-M7Js",
        "The upstream fix is available at: http://git.kernel.org/linus/3e645d6b485446c54c6745c5e2cf5c528fe4deec",
       "The vulnerable code was removed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.",
       "The vulnerable code was fixed in Debian with a kernel update (2.6.26-26lenny1).",
       "The vulnerability has been fixed in SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE 11.2 and 11.3 by updating their kernels.",
         "It has been assigned CVE-2010-2963.",
        "The flaw allows local users with `/dev/video` write permissions to overwrite arbitrary kernel memory on 64-bit systems."
