  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2784",
    "description": "A flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO initialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5 x86_64",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 5 x86_64",
      "Red Hat Virtualization 5 x86_64"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Insufficient constraints checking in the `exec.c:subpage_register()` function in QEMU-KVM.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The guest has some control over the index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO initialization.",
      "Subpage mmio can be registered over an existing memory page."
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user could cause a denial of service (crash the guest/host) or possibly escalate their privileges on the host.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious guest user can exploit the vulnerability by crafting specific MMIO configurations during sub-page initialization.",
    "required_capabilities": "A privileged user within a guest VM is required to exploit the vulnerability. The hypervisor must have the vulnerable version of qemu-kvm installed."
