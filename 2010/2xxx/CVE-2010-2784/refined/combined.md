# RHSA-2010:0622 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated rhev-hypervisor packages that fix multiple security issues and two
bugs are now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not
validate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card
driver. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to
dereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of
service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating
their privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be
forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses
controlled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on
the host. (CVE-2010-0429)

It was found that QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers
provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver. A privileged guest
user could use this flaw to cause the host to dereference an invalid
pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly,
resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-0431)

A flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the
index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO
initialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the
guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-2784)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found when Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor was run on a system that has a processor with the
Intel VT-x extension enabled. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
to trick the host into emulating a certain instruction, which could crash
the host (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0435)

A flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker
could trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,
preventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.
(CVE-2010-2811)

These updated packages provide updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for avahi issues
CVE-2009-0758 and CVE-2010-2244; freetype issues CVE-2010-1797,
CVE-2010-2498, CVE-2010-2499, CVE-2010-2500, CVE-2010-2519, CVE-2010-2527,
and CVE-2010-2541; kernel issues CVE-2010-1084, CVE-2010-2066,
CVE-2010-2070, CVE-2010-2226, CVE-2010-2248, CVE-2010-2521, and
CVE-2010-2524; and openldap issues CVE-2010-0211 and CVE-2010-0212.

These updated rhev-hypervisor packages also fix two bugs. Documentation for
these bug fixes will be available shortly from
<http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
fixes from the KVM update RHSA-2010:0627 have been included in this update.
Also included are the bug fixes from the VDSM update RHSA-2010:0628.

KVM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html> VDSM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0628.html>

Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to these updated rhev-hypervisor packages, which resolve these
issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=619411#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-07-29 13:47:22 UTC  ``` Description of the problem: It is possible that subpage mmio is registered over existing memory page. When this happens "memory" will have real memory address and not index into io_mem array so next access to the page will generate segfault. It is uncommon to have some part of a page to be accessed as memory and some as mmio, but qemu shouldn't crash even when guest does stupid things. So lets just pretend that the rest of the page is unassigned if guest configure part of the memory page as mmio.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-03-04 16:21:46 UTC  ``` Gleb Napatov found a bug in KVM that can be used to crash the host on Intel machines. If emulator is tricked into emulating mov to/from DR instruction it causes NULL pointer dereference on VMX since kvm_x86_ops->(set|get)_dr are not initialized. Recently this is not exploitable from guest userspace, but malicious guest kernel can trigger it easily.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:31:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0627 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:45:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0622 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0622.html>   ``` |  |

It is possible that subpage mmio is registered over existing memory
page. When this happens "memory" will have real memory address and not
index into io_mem array so next access to the page will generate
segfault. It is uncommon to have some part of a page to be accessed as
memory and some as mmio, but qemu shouldn't crash even when guest does
stupid things. So lets just pretend that the rest of the page is
unassigned if guest configure part of the memory page as mmio.

## Synopsis

Important: kvm security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0627)

## Topic

Updated kvm packages that fix three security issues and multiple bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

It was found that QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers
provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver. A privileged guest
user could use this flaw to cause the host to dereference an invalid
pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly,
resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-0431)

A flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the
index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO
initialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the
guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-2784)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found when the host system had a
processor with the Intel VT-x extension enabled. A privileged guest user
could use this flaw to trick the host into emulating a certain instruction,
which could crash the host (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0435)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* running a "qemu-img" check on a faulty virtual machine image ended with a

segmentation fault. With this update, the segmentation fault no longer
occurs when running the "qemu-img" check. (BZ#610342)

* when attempting to transfer a file between two guests that were joined in

the same virtual LAN (VLAN), the receiving guest unexpectedly quit. With
this update, the transfer completes successfully. (BZ#610343)

* installation of a system was occasionally failing in KVM. This was caused

by KVM using wrong permissions for large guest pages. With this update, the
installation completes successfully. (BZ#616796)

* previously, the migration process would fail for a virtual machine

because the virtual machine could not map all the memory. This was caused
by a conflict that was initiated when a virtual machine was initially run
and then migrated right away. With this update, the conflict no longer
occurs and the migration process no longer fails. (BZ#618205)

* using a thinly provisioned VirtIO disk on iSCSI storage and performing a

"qemu-img" check during an "e\_no\_space" event returned cluster errors. With
this update, the errors no longer appear. (BZ#618206)

All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. Note: The procedure in the
Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

The following procedure must be performed before this update will take
effect:

1) Stop all KVM guest virtual machines.

2) Either reboot the hypervisor machine or, as the root user, remove (using
"modprobe -r [module]") and reload (using "modprobe [module]") all of the
following modules which are currently running (determined using "lsmod"):
kvm, ksm, kvm-intel or kvm-amd.

3) Restart the KVM guest virtual machines.
