    "root_cause": "The IPv6 Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check function does not operate correctly in strict mode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper implementation of IPv6 Unicast RPF in strict mode."
    ],
    "impact": "Packets that should be discarded due to failing the uRPF check (e.g., spoofed IP addresses) are instead forwarded, leading to potential network security issues.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks via IPv6 packets with spoofed source addresses."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 packets to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not require authentication."

    "SEIL/X1 firmware 1.00 to 2.73",
    "SEIL/X2 firmware 1.00 to 2.73",
    "SEIL/B1 firmware 1.00 to 2.73"

  "additional_notes": [
    "The vulnerability is only present when IPv6 Unicast RPF is configured in strict mode. Loose mode is not affected.",
    "IPv4 uRPF functionality is not affected.",
    "The vendor has released firmware updates to address the vulnerability (version 2.74 for SEIL/X1, X2 and B1)."
