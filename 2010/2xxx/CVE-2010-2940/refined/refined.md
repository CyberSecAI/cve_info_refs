Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2940

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) allows authentication with a null or empty password when authenticating against an LDAP server that permits unauthenticated binds. This occurs because the LDAP server returns a successful bind even with no password provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing password authentication by providing an empty password, effectively granting access to accounts without the correct credentials.
- **Unauthenticated Binds:** This vulnerability relies on the LDAP server being configured to allow unauthenticated binds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A local or remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to user accounts without knowing the actual password.
- **System Compromise:** This can lead to full system compromise if the attacker gains access to an account with administrative privileges.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the compromised system.
- **Abuse of services**: Attackers could abuse services using pam_authenticate (like the GNOME screensaver, as mentioned).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access (Remote):** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely if they have network access to the system running the vulnerable SSSD instance and the vulnerable LDAP server.
- **Local Access:** Attackers can also exploit it locally, such as through applications utilizing `pam_authenticate`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate an authentication request to the SSSD service.
- The attacker needs access to a service that uses pam_authenticate (either locally or remotely).
- The LDAP server being targeted must allow unauthenticated binds.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Ted Brunell.
- A patch was created by Stephen Gallagher to disallow zero-length passwords during authentication.
- The affected component is SSSD.
- The vulnerability was classified as "high" priority and severity.
- The bug report (625189) within Red Hat's Bugzilla system explicitly mentions CVE-2010-2940 and details the issue.
