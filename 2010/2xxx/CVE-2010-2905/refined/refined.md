Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2905:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `info.php` script of the BS Scripts Directory software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `info.php` script, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data breach: Retrieval of sensitive data stored in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of data.
    - Privilege escalation:  Depending on the database permissions, an attacker could gain administrative access to the database server.
    - Denial of service: The attacker could potentially disrupt database services.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exploitable through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `info.php` script.
- Parameter manipulation: The `id` parameter in the URL is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- Knowledge of SQL:  The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft malicious injection payloads.

**Technical Details**
The exploit example provided is:
`http://www.site.com/Scripts_Directory/info.php?id=[sqli]`

This URL demonstrates that the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker would replace `[sqli]` with a suitable SQL injection payload.
