The provided content describes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability affecting multiple web browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Opera) through the exploitation of protocol handlers, specifically `news` and `nntp` protocols.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from how the browsers handle the `news` and `nntp` protocols when initiated through a large number of iframes. When the browser attempts to handle these protocols, it can lead to resource exhaustion or complete system lockup as it tries to launch the associated news/nntp client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **DoS via Protocol Handlers:** The browsers are vulnerable to DoS attacks due to improper handling of specific protocol handlers (`news`, `nntp`).
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The attack leads to resource exhaustion, causing the system to become unresponsive.
*   **System Lockup/Crash:** In some instances, particularly with Internet Explorer, the attack can cause the browser to crash or the system to lock up.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial of service, making the affected browsers unusable.
*   **System Instability:**  In some cases, the attack can destabilize the entire system, leading to crashes or lockups.
*   **Resource Consumption:** Even without a complete lockup, the attack consumes system resources and slows down the system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Iframe Injection:** The attack is conducted by embedding a large number of iframes on a page, each attempting to initiate a `news` or `nntp` protocol.
*   **JavaScript:** While the attack can be triggered using just HTML and iframes, JavaScript can be used as well.
*   **Webpage access:** The attacker only needs the victim to access the webpage containing the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create or control a webpage where the malicious iframes can be loaded.
*   The attacker doesn't require any special privileges on the user's system to perform the attack.
*   The victim must visit the malicious webpage in a vulnerable browser for the attack to take effect.

**Specific Browser Versions Affected:**

*   **Mozilla Firefox:** 3.0.19 (and likely 3.5.x and 3.6.x).
*   **Internet Explorer:** 6 (6.0.2900.2180) and 8 (8.0.7600.16385).
*  **Google Chrome:** 1.0.154.48
*   **Opera:** 9.52.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit for the `news` protocol caused a system lockup on most browsers, including the system trying to launch the news client (Opera), or browser crashes in the case of IE8 (when no news client was configured).
*   The `nntp` protocol exploit also causes similar lockup and resource consumption issues, specifically when trying to launch Opera as an nntp client. IE8 was not vulnerable to the `nntp` exploit when no news client was configured.
*   Opera was less affected, showing resource consumption without system lockups, although resource usage is still slower than other browsers.
