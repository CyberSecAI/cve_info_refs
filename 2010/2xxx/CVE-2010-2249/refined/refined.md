Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-2249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory leak vulnerability within the libpng library when processing malformed PNG images containing Physical Scale (sCAL) chunks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The vulnerability lies in how libpng handles malformed sCAL chunks, leading to a memory leak. The library fails to properly free allocated memory when encountering these malformed chunks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. A remote attacker can craft a malicious PNG image with a malformed sCAL chunk. When a user or application opens/processes this image, the memory leak can consume all available system resources, leading to the application or system crashing.
- **Application crash:** The vulnerability can result in application crashes due to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PNG Image:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted PNG image containing a malformed sCAL chunk.
- **User Interaction:** The user or an automated system needs to be tricked into opening or processing the malicious image through applications that utilize libpng for image processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:**  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting the malicious PNG file.
- **No special privileges:** No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability
- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the victim to open the malicious image.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists within the `pngrutil.c` file of libpng, specifically in how memory is managed when parsing malformed sCAL chunks.
- The fix involves ensuring that memory associated with sCAL chunks is properly freed, thus preventing the memory leak.
- This issue affects various applications that utilize the libpng library to process PNG images.

**Affected Software/Versions:**

The provided content indicates that the following products and versions are affected:

*   VMware Workstation 7.1.1 and earlier, 6.5.4 and earlier
*   VMware Player 3.1.1 and earlier, 2.5.4 and earlier
*   Apple TV software update 4.1
*   iOS 2.0 through 4.1 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 4.1 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 3.2.2 for iPad

*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5
*   Fedora 12, 13

**Mitigation:**
-   Upgrade libpng to versions 1.4.3, or 1.2.44 (or later versions that include the fix), depending on the affected software.
- Some applications may implement mitigations by ignoring unknown chunks.

In summary, CVE-2010-2249 is a memory leak vulnerability in libpng that can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by crafting a malicious PNG image. The vulnerability is resolved by updating to a patched version of libpng.
