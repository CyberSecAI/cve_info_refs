{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mountall program creates a udev rule file with world-writable permissions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "The created udev rule file, /dev/.udev/rules.d/root.rules, has insecure permissions, specifically world-writable (0666).",
    "The vulnerability is triggered due to a missing umask call before creating the file."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause udev to execute arbitrary commands as the root user by modifying the world-writable udev rule file.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation via modification of the world-writable udev rules file. Specifically, an attacker can write malicious rules to /dev/.udev/rules.d/root.rules.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker with the ability to write to the /dev/.udev/rules.d/root.rules file which requires a user that can write to the filesystem. Once modified, this will cause udev to execute arbitrary commands as root when it reloads the rules."
