Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:** The application `ProMan 0.1.1` suffers from multiple file inclusion vulnerabilities due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in include statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `_center.php` script includes a file based on the `page` GET parameter without sufficient sanitization. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files, provided the server's PHP configuration allows remote includes.
    ```php
     if (!($_GET['page']))
         include('info.php');
     else
         include $_GET['page'].'.php';
     ```
  - **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application also includes files based on the `userLang` session variable without proper sanitization. This permits an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating this variable.
    ```php
     include_once('lang/'.$_SESSION['userLang'].'/elisttasks.php');
    ```
    Specifically, by using a null byte `%00` an attacker can bypass the `.php` extension check and include any file on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **RFI:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code by including a malicious file hosted on a remote server.
  - **LFI:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, such as source code, database configuration files, or potentially execute local files if the included file is executable.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **RFI:** Sending a crafted GET request to `_center.php` with a malicious URL in the `page` parameter.
  - **LFI:** Sending a GET request to various scripts (`elisttasks.php`, `managepmanagers.php`, etc.)  with a manipulated `_SESSION[userLang]` parameter, including a null byte.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
  - For RFI, the attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a reachable server.
  - For LFI, the attacker needs knowledge of the server's file structure to include sensitive local files.
