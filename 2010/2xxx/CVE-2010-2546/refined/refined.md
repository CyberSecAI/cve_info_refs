  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2546",
      "description": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in libmikmod. These flaws could allow a remote attacker able to coerce a local user using an application linked against libmikmod, to open an Impulse Tracker, crafted samples, or an Ultratracker file, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
      "root_cause": "Multiple boundary errors in `load_it.c` of libmikmod lead to heap-based buffer overflows. Specifically, insufficient validation of envelope point counts when parsing Impulse Tracker files leads to out-of-bounds writes.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application, or Denial of Service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening specially crafted Impulse Tracker, samples, or Ultratracker files via an application linked against libmikmod"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious file using a vulnerable application.",
        "affected_packages": [
        "media-libs/libmikmod versions prior to 3.2.0_beta2-r3 and 3.1.12-r1"
