{
  "CVE-2010-2221": {
    "Root cause": "A missing bounds check when handling SCN messages in multiple implementations of iSCSI target, including scsi-target-utils, could result in a buffer overflow when the iSCSI Name string is longer than 1008 bytes. Additionally, further buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in isns_attr_query(), send_scn_rsp(), print_scn_pdu() and qry_rsp_handle() due to missing or incorrect length checks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Missing bounds check",
      "Improper handling of integer parameters",
       "Uncontrolled array index",
       "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Corruption of sensitive stack data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or system crashes. Vulnerabilities in `print_scn_pdu()` and `qry_rsp_handle()` can crash the target daemon by sending a bogus PDU with invalid tlv->length.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted SCN message with an iSCSI Name string exceeding 1008 bytes, or sending a bogus PDU with an invalid tlv->length to the affected iSCSI target service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable iSCSI target service. No prior authentication is mentioned, suggesting that a remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability."
