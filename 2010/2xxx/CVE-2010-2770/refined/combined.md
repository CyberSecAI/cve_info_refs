1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.6.10, fixing various bugs
and security issues.
Mozilla Thunderbird was updated to version 3.0.8 on openSUSE, fixing
the same bugs.
Mozilla Seamonkey was updated to version 2.0.8 on openSUSE, fixing
the same bugs.
A Firefox update for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 3 is still
being worked on and currently held back due to legal problems with
the Firefox 3.5 - 3.6 version upgrade and some browser components.
Following security issues were fixed:
MFSA 2010-49 / CVE-2010-3169: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that
with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.
MFSA 2010-50 / CVE-2010-2765: Security researcher Chris Rohlf
of Matasano Security reported that the implementation of the HTML
frameset element contained an integer overflow vulnerability. The code
responsible for parsing the frameset columns used an 8-byte counter for
the column numbers, so when a very large number of columns was passed
in the counter would overflow. When this counter was subsequently
used to allocate memory for the frameset, the memory buffer would
be too small, potentially resulting in a heap buffer overflow and
execution of attacker-controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-51 / CVE-2010-2767: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
reported a dangling pointer vulnerability in the implementation
of navigator.plugins in which the navigator object could retain a
pointer to the plugins array even after it had been destroyed. An
attacker could potentially use this issue to crash the browser and
run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-52 / CVE-2010-3131: Security researcher Haifei Li of
FortiGuard Labs reported that Firefox could be used to load a malicious
code library that had been planted on a victim's computer. Firefox
attempts to load dwmapi.dll upon startup as part of its platform
detection, so on systems that don't have this library, such as Windows
XP, Firefox will subsequently attempt to load the library from the
current working directory. An attacker could use this vulnerability
to trick a user into downloading a HTML file and a malicious copy
of dwmapi.dll into the same directory on their computer and opening
the HTML file with Firefox, thus causing the malicious code to be
executed. If the attacker was on the same network as the victim,
the malicious DLL could also be loaded via a UNC path. The attack
also requires that Firefox not currently be running when it is asked
to open the HTML file and accompanying DLL.
As this is a Windows only problem, it does not affect the Linux
version. It is listed for completeness only.
MFSA 2010-53 / CVE-2010-3166: Security researcher wushi of team509
reported a heap buffer overflow in code routines responsible
for transforming text runs. A page could be constructed with a
bidirectional text run which upon reflow could result in an incorrect
length being calculated for the run of text. When this value is
subsequently used to allocate memory for the text too small a buffer
may be created potentially resulting in a buffer overflow and the
execution of attacker controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-54 / CVE-2010-2760: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that there was a remaining
dangling pointer issue leftover from the fix to CVE-2010-2753. Under
certain circumstances one of the pointers held by a XUL tree selection
could be freed and then later reused, potentially resulting in the
execution of attacker-controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-55 / CVE-2010-3168: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that XUL <tree> objects could be
manipulated such that the setting of certain properties on the object
would trigger the removal of the tree from the DOM and cause certain
sections of deleted memory to be accessed. In products based on Gecko
version 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6, Thunderbird 3.1) and newer this memory has
been overwritten by a value that will cause an unexploitable crash. In
products based on Gecko version 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5, Thunderbird 3.0,
and SeaMonkey 2.0) and older an attacker could potentially use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on
their computer.
MFSA 2010-56 / CVE-2010-3167: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that the implementation of XUL
<tree>'s content view contains a dangling pointer vulnerability. One
of the content view's methods for accessing the internal structure of
the tree could be manipulated into removing a node prior to accessing
it, resulting in the accessing of deleted memory. If an attacker can
control the contents of the deleted memory prior to its access they
could use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a victim's
machine.
MFSA 2010-57 / CVE-2010-2766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that code used to normalize
a document contained a logical flaw that could be leveraged to run
arbitrary code. When the normalization code ran, a static count of
the document's child nodes was used in the traversal, so a page could
be constructed that would remove DOM nodes during this normalization
which could lead to the accessing of a deleted object and potentially
the execution of attacker-controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-58 / CVE-2010-2770: Security researcher Marc Schoenefeld
reported that a specially crafted font could be applied to a document
and cause a crash on Mac systems. The crash showed signs of memory
corruption and presumably could be used by an attacker to execute
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
This issue probably does not affect the Linux builds and so is listed
for completeness.
MFSA 2010-59 / CVE-2010-2762: Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported
that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW), a security
wrapper that allows content-defined objects to be safely accessed by
privileged code, creates scope chains ending in outer objects. Users
of SJOWs which expect the scope chain to end on an inner object may
be handed a chrome privileged object which could be leveraged to run
arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.
Michal Zalewski's recent contributions helped to identify this
architectural weakness.
MFSA 2010-60 / CVE-2010-2763: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) on
the Mozilla 1.9.1 development branch has a logical error in its
scripted function implementation that allows the caller to run the
function within the context of another site. This is a violation of
the same-origin policy and could be used to mount an XSS attack.
MFSA 2010-61 / CVE-2010-2768: Security researchers David Huang and
Collin Jackson of Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Silicon Valley
campus) reported that the type attribute of an <object> tag can
override the charset of a framed HTML document, even when the document
is included across origins. A page could be constructed containing
such an <object> tag which sets the charset of the framed document
to UTF-7. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject UTF-7
encoded JavaScript into a site, bypassing the site's XSS filters,
and then executing the code using the above technique.
MFSA 2010-62 / CVE-2010-2769: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that when an HTML selection containing JavaScript is copy-and-pasted
or dropped onto a document with designMode enabled the JavaScript
will be executed within the context of the site where the code was
dropped. A malicious site could leverage this issue in an XSS attack
by persuading a user into taking such an action and in the process
running malicious JavaScript within the context of another site.
MFSA 2010-63 / CVE-2010-2764: Matt Haggard reported that the
statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object is readable by the
requestor even when the request is made across origins. This status
information reveals the presence of a web server and could be used
to gather information about servers on internal private networks.
This issue was also independently reported to Mozilla by Nicholas
Berthaume
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart all running Mozilla instances after installing the update.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-58

## Crash on Mac using fuzzed font in data: URL

Announced
September 7, 2010
Reporter
Marc Schoenefeld
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.12
* Firefox 3.6.9
* SeaMonkey 2.0.7
* Thunderbird 3.0.7
* Thunderbird 3.1.3

### Description

Security researcher **Marc Schoenefeld** reported that
a specially crafted font could be applied to a document and cause a
crash on Mac systems. The crash showed signs of memory corruption and
presumably could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a
victim's computer.

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Attached file
[testcase (crash)](attachment.cgi?id=461832)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=461832&action=edit)

Marc Schoenefeld reported the following to security@mozilla.org. I confirmed that it crashed for me on Firefox 3.6.8, but NOT on trunk. I died before Crash Reporter came up, but I saved the relevant portion of the Apple crash report, which I'll attach.
Crash Wrangler told Marc that it was a double free issue, but I can't tell if that's consistent with what I got. sg:crit? until we know for sure.
----------
Hi,
my font fuzzer triggered the following on Ffx 3.6.8/OSX10.6
The testcase is attached as html file embedding the
malformed font in a data: url tag. The Crashwrangler
wrapped said it is exploitable, so I thought I better forward
this.
Summary from CW:
Faulty glyph (id:38) outline detected - replacing with a space/null
glyph - in memory font kind
Fri Jul 30 12:20:24 maeckes2.local firefox-bin[10483] <Error>:

So we may be just leaking something that 3.6.x does not, thus cloaking the underlying problem.

When running this in 1.9.2 debug builds on 10.6 I get lots of malloc errors, after which the app fails in a variety of places - DrawCellWithScaling, the cycle collector, \_cairo\_quartz\_surface\_show\_glyphs. On 10.5 this is really hard to track down as it completely locks up my machine (!) and I have to do a hard reboot.

[Reduced testcase](attachment.cgi?id=462241) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=462241&action=edit)

Here's a reduced testcase.
There are a couple of things that are very odd about it (particularly
#1 in my list). This makes me think we might be dealing with more
than one bug here.
1) The crashes only happen if the testcase has at least one button,
and if its label has at least two characters. They happen drawing
the button.
2) Without the META tag, the crashes only happen on the 1.9.1 branch
(testing with today's nightlies on OS X 10.6.4) -- not also on the
1.9.2 branch.

from [comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=583520#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mac crash with fuzzed font in data: URL"), you may need to download it and open it locally (or

The ATSServer is pegged at 100% CPU which is the cause of the system hang. Killing that process (it restarts automatically) eliminates the hang.

[Stack trace of "faulty glyph" exceptions](attachment.cgi?id=462536)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=462536&action=edit)

(Following up [comment #17](/show_bug.cgi?id=583520#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mac crash with fuzzed font in data: URL"))
> I'm playing a hunch ... which if it works out might lead to a simple
> fix.
>

It didn't work out ... but I might yet be able to salvage something.
Remember (from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=583520#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mac crash with fuzzed font in data: URL")) that the following error shows up (hundreds
of times in my tests) in the seconds before this bug's crash (on OS X
10.6.X):
Faulty glyph (id:38) outline detected -
replacing with a space/null glyph - in memory font kind
Here's a stack trace of the code from which these errors get
displayed. (They're displayed by a C++ exception handler in
libTrueTypeScaler.dylib (in the ATS framework, which is in turn inside
the ApplicationServices framework). I broke on calls to \_\_cxa\_throw
(from libstdc++.dylib).)
Note that all these C++ exceptions occur during the call to
ATSUGetGlyphBounds() from gfxAtsuiFontGroup::InitTextRun().
ATSUGetGlyphBounds() has an error return, which we discard in current
code. I'd hoped that the "faulty glyph" error message corresponded to
an uncaught C++ exception, and that it would result in
ATSUGetGlyphBounds() returning an error. No such luck :-(
I'll look for another way to "expose" these exceptions to
gfxAtsuiFontGroup::InitTextRun() -- if only as a proof of concept (to
see if we can get around the crashes by somehow handling these
exceptions in gfxAtsuiFontGroup::InitTextRun()).

When I run a current 1.9.2 branch build inside gdb (an opt build with
debug symbols) and set NSZombieEnabled to "Yes" ("set env
NSZombieEnabled Yes"), this bug's crashes no longer happen. But I end
up crashing anyway, shortly after a memory allocation fails.
When I look at the crashed firefox-bin process with 'top', I find that
it's VSIZE (virtual memory) is 4 gigs (it's normally about 1 gig) and
the number of memory regions (MREGS) is enormously larger than it
should be (about 25000 as opposed to about 450).
Something is clearly eating huge amounts of RAM in many small bites.
We don't yet know whether it's the OS or the browser.

This is with or without NSZombieEnabled. The crashed process is
running in gdb.
This devouring of memory doesn't happen on the trunk. So it's pretty
clear the problem is ATSUI -- either in itself or in our use of it.

malloc\_history can't find this RAM. I'm pretty sure this means that
it's been allocated by the OS (using something else than malloc) --
which tends to place the blame for this problem on the OS (and
specifically on ATSUI).
Here's what I did:
1) gdb /path/to/firefox-bin
2) set env MallocStackLogging 1
3) run
4) Load a local copy of my reduced testcase from [comment #10](/show_bug.cgi?id=583520#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mac crash with fuzzed font in data: URL").
5) Wait for the browser to crash.
6) Find firefox-bin's pid (from outside of gdb).
7) Run the following (also outside of gdb):
a) malloc\_history [firefox-bin's pid] -all\_by\_size
b) malloc\_history [firefox-bin's pid] -all\_by\_count
The top allocation by size (56016 calls for 1549932 bytes) wasn't
nearly big enough. Neither were the top five allocations by count
(69485 calls for 277940 bytes, 56016 calls for 1549932 bytes, 53328
calls for 853248 bytes, 43436 calls for 161080 bytes). (Note that I
assume the byte figures are totals -- that "56016 calls for 1549932
bytes" means "56016 calls for a total of 1549932 bytes". Someone
please tell me if I'm wrong.) The "56016 calls for 1549932 bytes" was
from gfxTextRun::AllocateDetailedGlyphs().
I got pretty much the same numbers even when I skipped steps 4 and 5
-- though gfxTextRun::AllocateDetailedGlyphs() wasn't in the list.
I also got pretty much the same numbers on the trunk without skipping
steps 4 and 5 -- and gfxTextRun::AllocateDetailedGlyphs() was top of
the list.
My understanding is that, when using MallocStackLogging,
malloc\_history doesn't show statistics for allocations that were made
and then freed.

ATS is encountering failures due to corrupt glyph data; it seems plausible that each time it tries to rasterize such a glyph it allocates memory for the glyph bitmap, and then fails to clean up properly when it aborts the rasterization. That would rapidly lead to out-of-memory failure and bring down the whole app, just like we're seeing here.

libTrueTypeScaler.dylib doesn't import any strange, low-level methods
for allocating RAM (only calloc, malloc and realloc). So I think the
debugging facilities in Apple's malloc implementation (those activated
by setting MallocStackLogging to 1) must not record calls to malloc
from system libraries.

I've given up on this, at least for the time being. Whatever I come
up with is likely to be very hackish, and not narrowly focused.
We should give some thought, though, to whether or not it's possible
to get rid of the call to ATSUGetGlyphBounds() in
gfxAtsuiFontGroup::InitTextRun(). I don't know enough about the font
code to answer this question myself.

Attached patch

[patch, check alloc fails within cocoa native theme code](attachment.cgi?id=465147&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=465147&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=583520&attachment=465147)

With this patch I don't get the SIGILL crashes in DrawCellWithScaling within Cocoa native theme code. Eventually mem alloc's fail and the browser aborts. I did see a couple crashes in the cycle collector after mem alloc failures occurred but I can't reproduce those now.
Josh, feel free to reassign if you're not the right person for this.

In the last block of the patch here you're releasing "colorSpace" for a second time. It was already released after the call to "CGBitmapContextCreate".

Also, confirmed that this doesn't fix the problem on 10.5, on 10.5 the ATS server goes into an infinite loop and effectively hangs the system.

I'm not sure that this is fully fixed. I'm crashing when running through the manual tests.
Running through the attached testcases in a nightly build, I was able to get crashes, though not every time. This was using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.9pre) Gecko/20100819 Namoroka/3.6.9pre on 10.6.4.
With the reduced testcase, rev 1, I got the follow crash which our crashreporter didn't catch (the data is from Apple's crash reporter): <http://mozilla.pastebin.com/P3TuxeWP>
I got this crash with the original attached testcase after I loaded it a few times: <http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-2145062c-49e3-45ae-a76b-4691e2100819>
If I load each of the testcases a few times individually in series with the others without starting a new browser session, I will get a hang followed by either a crashreporter caught crash or an Apple caught crash.

This looks like it is having the same problems in 1.9.1. Running the first testcase, I'm getting a system level crash in OS X 10.6.4 with the nightly 1.9.1 build.
With the rev 1 of the reduced case, I get this crash: <http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/deec2acc-7eb6-4215-a381-6b5f72100820>

Yup, the testcase stresses memory so all sorts of out-of-memory related bugs will happen. But the original crash was a SIGILL crash which is a bad thing in security terms, it means that random data was executed as code. So \*that\* crash is fixed but other crashes will still occur.

Out-of-memory abort, not a crash.

Yeah, this looks a lot like the crash in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=583520#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mac crash with fuzzed font in data: URL").
So I think this should stay "fixed", since the original sg:critical crash was fixed. We should log other crashes as separate bugs.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
