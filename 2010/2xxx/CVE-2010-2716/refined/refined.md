- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `ndetail.php` and `print.php` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized input within the `id` parameter allows for arbitrary SQL queries to be executed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data within the database, potentially modifying or deleting it.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET requests with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter of `ndetail.php` and `print.php` files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
