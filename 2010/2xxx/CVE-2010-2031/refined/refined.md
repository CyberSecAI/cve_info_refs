```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `KAVSafe.sys` driver creates a device called `\\Device\\KAVSafe` and handles DeviceIoControl requests with `IoControlCode = 0x830020d4`. This IO control code allows overwriting arbitrary kernel module data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "The driver exposes an interface that allows arbitrary kernel memory writes."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can gain kernel-mode privileges, effectively escalating their privileges to the highest level on the system. This can lead to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can send a specially crafted `DeviceIoControl` request to the `\\Device\\KAVSafe` device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to execute code locally on the targeted system to open a handle to the vulnerable device and send the malicious IO control code. "
