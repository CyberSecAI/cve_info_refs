A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code using specially
crafted streams, IPP requests or files, or cause a Denial of Service
(daemon crash or hang). A local attacker may be able to gain escalated
privileges or overwrite arbitrary files. Furthermore, a remote attacker
may be able to obtain sensitive information from the CUPS process or
hijack a CUPS administrator authentication request.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.4.8-r1"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since September 03, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.

# RHSA-2010:0811 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: cups security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0811)

## Topic

Updated cups packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX operating systems.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the CUPS server parsed Internet
Printing Protocol (IPP) packets. A malicious user able to send IPP requests
to the CUPS server could use this flaw to crash the CUPS server or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CUPS server.
(CVE-2010-2941)

A possible privilege escalation flaw was found in CUPS. An unprivileged
process running as the "lp" user (such as a compromised external filter
program spawned by the CUPS server) could trick the CUPS server into
overwriting arbitrary files as the root user. (CVE-2010-2431)

Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NATO C3 Agency for
reporting the CVE-2010-2941 issue.

Users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-17 20:27:36 UTC  ``` Quoting from the upstream bug report <http://cups.org/str.php?L3510>:  directory that is writable by unprivileged processes.  This is a latent privilege escalation vulnerability.  It can be exploited only in the presence of other CUPS vulnerabilities.  Why this is privilege escalation --------------------------------  This is privilege escalation, because an unprivileged process can trick the CUPS server into overwriting arbitrary files as root.  Example:      drwxrwxr-x  4 root lp /var/cache/cups     -rw-r-----  1 root lp /var/cache/cups/remote.cache  This file is opened with cupsFileOpen() which simply opens the file with open(filename, O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC | O_CREAT | O_LARGEFILE | O_BINARY, 0666).  If a CUPS "external" program has a vulnerability, an attacker can use the group=lp privileges to replace /var/cache/cups/remote.cache with a symlink to a root-writable file. CUPS will then overwrite that file as root. A similar latent vulnerability exists for the state file /var/cache/cups/job.cache.  Why this is a latent vulnerability ----------------------------------  This is a latent vulnerability, because there is no known exploit for CUPS "external" programs that run as user=lp, group=lp.   The upstream fix looks more like a preventative fix as there does not seem to be anything exploitable here, so this looks like more a hardening than a response to an actual flaw.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-17 20:34:24 UTC  ``` Created cups tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 605399](show_bug.cgi?id=605399 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-0540 CVE-2010-0542 CVE-2010-1748 CVE-2010-2431 cups various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c3)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-18 11:03:24 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c4)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-18 11:04:24 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c5)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-18 11:05:00 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.4-1.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.4-1.fc11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-23 10:33:32 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-2431](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2431) to this vulnerability:  The cupsFileOpen function in CUPS before 1.4.4 allows local users, with lp group membership, to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the (1) /var/cache/cups/remote.cache or (2) /var/cache/cups/job.cache file.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=624438#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-16 13:21:56 UTC  ``` Emmanuel Bouillon reported a memory corruption flaw in CUPS daemon.  A specially-crafted IPP request can cause daemon to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Emmanuel Bouillon of NATO C3 Agency for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=624438#c1)  Tim Waugh    2010-08-16 14:20:11 UTC  ``` The problem is a mismatch between different memory allocators.  In the IPP protocol, an attribute can have multiple values, and each value is typed.  In the CUPS data model for this, all values for a given attribute must have the same (or a compatible) type.  String types have values allocated with the StrAlloc allocator, a reference-counting string pool.  'Unknown' types use malloc.  By giving the first value for an attribute a value tag of 56, which does not correspond to any particular value type and so is 'unknown', but which also is accepted as 'compatible' with string types due to the value tag range check, CUPS does not reject the request.  The 'unknown' value is allocated using malloc; the remaining values are allocated using StrAlloc.  When the in-memory request is freed, free() is used for all values including those allocated using StrAlloc.  The solution is to use exactly the same conditions when deciding how to allocate the value as when freeing it.  The initial value is allocated using malloc(), as it does not match any of the value tag cases.  Successive values are allocated using StrAlloc because they are string types.  Here is the compatibility check just before the successive values are allocated (cups/ipp.c); here, value_tag is the value tag given to the first value, and tag is the value tag given to the current (successive) value:             /*             * Make sure we aren't adding a new value of a different             * type...             */              if (value_tag == IPP_TAG_ZERO)             {              /*               * Setting the value of a collection member...               */                attr->value_tag = tag;             }             else if ((value_tag >= IPP_TAG_TEXTLANG &&                       value_tag <= IPP_TAG_MIMETYPE))             {              /*               * String values can sometimes come across in different               * forms; accept sets of differing values...               */              /*               * String values can sometimes come across in different               * forms; accept sets of differing values...               */                if ((tag < IPP_TAG_TEXTLANG || tag > IPP_TAG_MIMETYPE) &&                   tag != IPP_TAG_NOVALUE)               {                 DEBUG_printf(("1ippReadIO: 1setOf value tag %x(%s) != %x(%s)",                               value_tag, ippTagString(value_tag), tag,                               ippTagString(tag)));                 ipp_buffer_release(buffer);                 return (IPP_ERROR);               }             }             else if (value_tag != tag)             {               DEBUG_printf(("1ippReadIO: value tag %x(%s) != %x(%s)",                             value_tag, ippTagString(value_tag), tag,                             ippTagString(tag)));               ipp_buffer_release(buffer);               return (IPP_ERROR);             }  Now, IPP_TAG_TEXTLANG < 56 < IPP_TAG_MIMETYPE, so '56' is allowed to be compatible with string types -- even though it uses a different allocator.  Here is how the data is freed:      default :         if (!((int)attr->value_tag & IPP_TAG_COPY))         {           for (i = 0, value = attr->values;                i < attr->num_values;                i ++, value ++)             if (value->unknown.data)               free(value->unknown.data);         }         break;  (because all the values are collected together under the '56' value tag).  As far as I have been able to tell from source code inspection, all versions of CUPS are vulnerable to this denial of service attack.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=624438#c2)  Tim Waugh    2010-08-16 14:21:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 438968](attachment.cgi?id=438968&action=diff "cups-value-tag-mismatch.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=438968&action=edit "cups-value-tag-mismatch.patch") cups-value-tag-mismatch.patch  Patch attached (for RHEL-6) to fix the compatibility check to use exactly the same checking as in _ippAttrFree().   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=624438#c3)  Tim Waugh    2010-08-16 15:43:30 UTC  ``` RHEL-3 and RHEL-4 are not vulnerable to this because they do not use the string pool/StrAlloc allocator, only malloc (in fact strdup).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=624438#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-17 09:33:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=624438#c1)) > As far as I have been able to tell from source code inspection, all versions > of CUPS are vulnerable to this denial of service attack.  There are differences in the impact between 1.3 and 1.4 CUPS versions due to the differences in the way _cups_sp_item_t is organized.  In 1.4, _cups_sp_item_t is:       71 typedef struct _cups_sp_item_s		/**** String Pool Item ****/      72 {      73 #  ifdef DEBUG_GUARDS      74   unsigned int	guard;			/* Guard word */      75 #  endif /* DEBUG_GUARDS */      76   unsigned int	ref_count;		/* Reference count */      77   char		str[1];			/* String */      78 } _cups_sp_item_t;  _cupsStrAlloc() allocates new item as:   calloc(1, sizeof(_cups_sp_item_t) + strlen(s))  and returns str pointer.  Therefore, _cupsStrFree() calls free() on a value point to the middle of the malloced chunk, triggering glibc malloc checks failure and abort.  In 1.3, _cups_sp_item_t is:       69 typedef struct _cups_sp_item_s		/**** String Pool Item ****/      70 {      71   char		*str;			/* String */      72   unsigned int	ref_count;		/* Reference count */      73 } _cups_sp_item_t;  and str is strdup()-allocated independently of the structure.  Hence value passed to free() from _cupsStrFree() points to valid malloc()ed chunk that can be freed, but string pool item is not properly ref-counted and removed from string pool, that may lead to use-after-free with possible additional memory corruptions.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=624438#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-25 13:08:14 UTC  ``` Status update: we still don't have any embargo date proposal from Apple security team.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-17 20:27:36 UTC  ``` Quoting from the upstream bug report <http://cups.org/str.php?L3510>:  directory that is writable by unprivileged processes.  This is a latent privilege escalation vulnerability.  It can be exploited only in the presence of other CUPS vulnerabilities.  Why this is privilege escalation --------------------------------  This is privilege escalation, because an unprivileged process can trick the CUPS server into overwriting arbitrary files as root.  Example:      drwxrwxr-x  4 root lp /var/cache/cups     -rw-r-----  1 root lp /var/cache/cups/remote.cache  This file is opened with cupsFileOpen() which simply opens the file with open(filename, O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC | O_CREAT | O_LARGEFILE | O_BINARY, 0666).  If a CUPS "external" program has a vulnerability, an attacker can use the group=lp privileges to replace /var/cache/cups/remote.cache with a symlink to a root-writable file. CUPS will then overwrite that file as root. A similar latent vulnerability exists for the state file /var/cache/cups/job.cache.  Why this is a latent vulnerability ----------------------------------  This is a latent vulnerability, because there is no known exploit for CUPS "external" programs that run as user=lp, group=lp.   The upstream fix looks more like a preventative fix as there does not seem to be anything exploitable here, so this looks like more a hardening than a response to an actual flaw.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-17 20:34:24 UTC  ``` Created cups tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 605399](show_bug.cgi?id=605399 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-0540 CVE-2010-0542 CVE-2010-1748 CVE-2010-2431 cups various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c3)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-18 11:03:24 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c4)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-18 11:04:24 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c5)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-18 11:05:00 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.4-1.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.4-1.fc11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=605397#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-23 10:33:32 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-2431](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2431) to this vulnerability:  The cupsFileOpen function in CUPS before 1.4.4 allows local users, with lp group membership, to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the (1) /var/cache/cups/remote.cache or (2) /var/cache/cups/job.cache file.
