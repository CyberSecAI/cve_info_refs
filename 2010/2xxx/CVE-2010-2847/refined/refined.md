{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The l parameter in alikon/captcha.php is not properly sanitized before being used to create a path for a file that will be downloaded.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the local resources of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the l parameter in the URL to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../), an attacker can access files outside the intended directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable component, which is typically accessible remotely."
