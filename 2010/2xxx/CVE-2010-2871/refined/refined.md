    {
      "CVE ID": "CVE-2010-2871",
      "CVSS SCORE": "10.0, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C",
      "AFFECTED VENDORS": "Adobe",
      "AFFECTED PRODUCTS": "Shockwave Player",
      "VULNERABILITY DETAILS": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the application's support for 3D objects. While parsing the 0xFFFFFF45 RIFF record type, the process performs arithmetic on a size value and uses the result for a heap-based allocation. By specifying a large enough value an attacker can force the integer to wrap and thus the process will under-allocate the buffer. This memory is later copied into using a different size value which results in object corruption that can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser."
    }
  ],
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow during calculation of buffer size when parsing a specific RIFF record type (0xFFFFFF45) for 3D objects in Adobe Shockwave Player, leading to heap under-allocation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap under-allocation, leading to heap corruption. The vulnerability resides in the processing of a specific RIFF record, triggering an integer overflow during buffer size calculation. The program uses one size for allocation and another size for copying into the allocated buffer, leading to a heap overflow when the copy size is larger than the allocated buffer.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution in the context of the user running the browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "Visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file that contains a specially crafted Shockwave Director file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to lure the victim to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
