**Impact of Exploitation:**

The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
*   Unauthorized access
*   Privilege escalation
*   Unauthorized disclosure of information
*   Unauthorized modifications

The HP bulletin lists these impacts as potential consequences of exploiting vulnerabilities in HP Secure Web Server (SWS) for OpenVMS running PHP, which includes CVE-2010-2097. The SUSE bulletin mentions that vulnerabilities in PHP could lead to security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is "remote", as indicated by the "AV:N" (Network) component of the CVSS vector strings provided ("(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)"). This suggests that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable PHP application remotely. The CVSS vector also indicates low access complexity "AC:L" (Low) and no authentication "Au:N" (None) required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information does not give specific details about what type of vulnerability it is.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by updating PHP to version 5.2.14 (openSUSE 11.1) and 5.3.3/5.2.14 (SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3) according to the SUSE security reports. HP also provided a patch (CSWS_PHP V2.2-1) for HP Secure Web Server (SWS) for OpenVMS running PHP V2.2 and earlier.
*   The CVSS base score for CVE-2010-2097 is 5.0, with a vector of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N), indicating a moderate severity vulnerability with a potential impact of partial information disclosure.

In summary, CVE-2010-2097 is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in PHP that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, disclose information, or modify data on affected systems. Patches to PHP were released to address the vulnerability.
