| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-14 21:41:55 UTC  ``` Multiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in libmikmod. These flaws could allow a remote attacker able to coerce a local user using an application linked against libmikmod, to open an Impulse Tracker, crafted samples, or an Ultratracker file, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  CVE-2009-3995:  Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in IN_MOD.DLL (aka the Module Decoder Plug-in) in Winamp before 5.57, and libmikmod 3.1.12, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted samples or (2) crafted instrument definitions in an Impulse Tracker file. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.  CVE-2009-3996:  Heap-based buffer overflow in IN_MOD.DLL (aka the Module Decoder Plug-in) in Winamp before 5.57, and libmikmod 3.1.12, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an Ultratracker file.

This seem to contain following two upstream CVS commits:  <http://mikmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mikmod/libmikmod/loaders/load_it.c?r1=1.3&r2=1.4> <http://mikmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mikmod/libmikmod/loaders/load_ult.c?r1=1.2&r2=1.3>  However, load_it.c fix seems to be incomplete and possibly mis-placed too.  IT_ProcessEnvelope macro is used do common processing on volume, panning and pitch envelopes.  It writes to volenv/panenv/pitenv arrays with ENVPOINTS size using volpts/panpts/pitpts as an upper bound (those are unsigned char variables, with maximum value of 255), for loop following the check is hence not the first place where name##env arrays are written to.  I don't see why upstream fix only adds check for vol and not pan and pit, and why the check is not done in IT_LoadEnvelope already.  Reading the Secunia advisory, it seems they've treated all tree cases as issues:  "... when parsing an instrument containing a column, panning, or pitch envelope with more than ENVPOINTS (32) points ..."  (I guess this should say: containing a *volume*, panning, or pitch envelope)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-19 15:44:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c5)) > It writes to volenv/panenv/pitenv arrays with ENVPOINTS size using > volpts/panpts/pitpts as an upper bound (those are unsigned char variables, > with maximum value of 255), for loop following the check is hence not the > first place where name##env arrays are written to.  Additionally, values written to name##env are read from name##tick and name##node, which are of size ITENVCNT (25).   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-22 14:16:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c5))  > However, load_it.c fix seems to be incomplete and possibly mis-placed too.  > IT_ProcessEnvelope macro is used do common processing on volume, panning and > pitch envelopes.

Secunia reproducers crash libmikmod with upstream patch for [CVE-2009-3995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3995), so that fix is really bogus.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-22 14:24:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 433716](attachment.cgi?id=433716&action=diff "Do checks in IT_LoadEnvelope") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=433716&action=edit "Do checks in IT_LoadEnvelope") Do checks in IT_LoadEnvelope  Moves name##pts check to IT_LoadEnvelope.  Uses ITENVCNT as an upper bound.  It is less than name##env size (ENVPOINTS), but only ITENVCNT items are read from file to name##node and name##tick, so trying to user higher upper bound should over-read buffer.  Please correct me if I'm missing something.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-22 14:38:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c11)) > Created an attachment (id=433716) [details] > Do checks in IT_LoadEnvelope  <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3033086&group_id=40531&atid=428227>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-27 06:06:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c12))  > <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3033086&group_id=40531&atid=428227>      [CVE-2010-2546](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2546) was assigned to the incorrect [CVE-2009-3995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3995) fix.  As updates for Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux mikmod packages were not released yet, updates containing complete fix will not need to mention [CVE-2010-2546](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2546).   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c16)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-05 15:15:28 UTC  ``` The water is even muddier... MITRE also assigned [CVE-2010-2971](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2971) due to the incomplete fix of [CVE-2009-3995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3995).  For clarification, MITRE's descriptions of the problems are as follows:  CVE-2010-2546:  Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in loaders/load_it.c in libmikmod, possibly 3.1.12, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted samples or (2) crafted instrument definitions in an Impulse Tracker file, related to panpts, pitpts, and IT_ProcessEnvelope.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2009-3995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3995).  CVE-2010-2971:  loaders/load_it.c in libmikmod, possibly 3.1.12, does not properly account for the larger size of name##env relative to name##tick and name##node, which allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer over-read and possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Impulse Tracker file, a related issue to [CVE-2010-2546](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2546).  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2009-3995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3995).   Neither of these CVEs need to be mentioned due to the fact that we did not improperly fix [CVE-2009-3995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3995).   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c17)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-16 18:07:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c16)) > The water is even muddier... MITRE also assigned [CVE-2010-2971](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2971) due to the > incomplete fix of [CVE-2009-3995](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3995).  Not really.  Mitre decided to give separate CVE [CVE-2010-2971](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2971) to the over-read issue mentioned above in [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c6).  Though the over-read is rather limited and not too likely to have any real impact.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=614643#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-09-28 12:36:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0720 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0720.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libmikmod: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201203-10**

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in libmikmod may allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libmikmod** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.0\_beta2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.0\_beta2-r3**revision >= **3.1.12-r1** |

### Background

libmikmod is a library to play a wide range of module formats.

### Description

Multiple boundary errors have been found in load\_it.c in libmikmod,
which may cause a buffer overflow.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open specially crafted files in
an application linked against libmikmod, possibly resulting in execution
of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application, or Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libmikmod 3.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=media-libs/libmikmod-3.2.0_beta2-r3"

```

All libmikmod 3.1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libmikmod-3.1.12-r1"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

| [Description](#c0)  JR Boyens    2002-01-25 15:56:21 UTC  ``` The 0.51 version of gaim that I just emerge'd lacks the main, non-applet, binary. I'm confused by this and am unsure as to whether or not this is a real bug. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Bruce A. Locke    2002-01-26 03:34:04 UTC  ```  This seems to be caused by retardation in gaim's configure script...   If configure is called with --enable-panel then you end up with just gaim_applet.  If you disable gnome support you get a standalone binary.  I havn't looked at the makefiles enough to know if we can hack them to build  both or if we have to compile gaim twice if gnome support is enabled.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Bruce A. Locke    2002-01-27 00:55:05 UTC  ``` gaim-0.51-r1 was checked into CVS which hopefully fixes this.  The standalone binary and gaim_applet should both be built when gnome support is enabled.  Please let me know if you find any issues with the new build. ``` |  |

Package        : libmikmod
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-2546

Tomas Hoger discovered that the upstream fix for CVE-2009-3995 was
insufficient. This update provides a corrected package.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.11-6.0.1+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.11-6.3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libmikmod packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
