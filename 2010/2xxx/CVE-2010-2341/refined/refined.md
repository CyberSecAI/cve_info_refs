{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's `commentform.php` script includes an external file based on the `tpl_base_dir` parameter without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to `commentform.php` containing a malicious URL in the `tpl_base_dir` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and must have a location to host a malicious script to include."
