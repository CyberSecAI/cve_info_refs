              "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability is present in the Linker IMG 1.0 application.",

          "root_cause": "The application includes files based on user-controlled parameters without sufficient sanitization, but the vulnerability is more likely Local File Inclusion (LFI) and not Remote File Inclusion (RFI).",
          "weaknesses": [
             "The vulnerability is more accurately categorized as Local File Inclusion (LFI).",
            "The `$lan_dir` parameter is processed by the `cook_lan` cookie, not directly from the URL.",
            "The `include()` statements use relative paths, limiting the vulnerability to local files, not remote files.",
             "The `$Sdb_type` parameter is likely set in an executable config file generated on installation rather than directly controllable by the user."
            ],
          "impact": "An attacker can include local files. The impact is reduced because RFI is not possible, however, LFI can still leak sensitive information, or lead to other attacks.",
          "attack_vector": "By manipulating the `$lan_dir` parameter via cookie or potentially abusing the `$Sdb_type` parameter through configuration file modification, an attacker could include local files.",
