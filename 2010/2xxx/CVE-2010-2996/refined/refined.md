Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2996:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how RealNetworks RealPlayer parses RealMedia (.IVR) files. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate an index within the file's data header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The application trusts an index within the .IVR file, which is used to seek into a list of objects.
- **Out-of-Bounds Access:** When a malformed .IVR file provides an index that is outside the bounds of the internal object array, the application dereferences an invalid memory location.
- **Uncontrolled Pointer Dereference:** The out-of-bounds memory address is later dereferenced as an object and a function call is made to the address contained within that memory location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running RealPlayer, potentially gaining complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious .IVR file with a malformed data header.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious .IVR file or visit a malicious web page that causes the player to process the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted .IVR file or lure a user to a malicious website which causes the application to process the malformed .IVR file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Zero Day Initiative advisory provides more detailed technical specifics about the vulnerability compared to the basic description usually found in the CVE entry.
-  A patch for the vulnerability is mentioned in the additional details section provided by the vendor RealNetworks.
