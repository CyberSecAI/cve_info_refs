  "related": true,
  "summary": "Acrobat Reader vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to unspecified issues when handling specially crafted PDF documents.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap based buffer overflow",
      "Unspecified vulnerability in PDF processing"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application, or cause a denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Remote attack via a specially crafted PDF document"

   "additionalInformation": "This vulnerability is associated with multiple other CVEs in the same set of patches from Adobe, as seen in the provided documents. Disabling JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat may prevent some exploits from resulting in code execution. Preventing PDF files from opening inside a web browser will partially mitigate this vulnerability. Also, users should not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF files, particularly those hosted on websites or delivered as email attachments."
