# CUPS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201207-10**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in CUPS, some of which may
allow execution of arbitrary code or local privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-print/cups** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.8-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.8-r1** |

### Background

CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System, is a full-featured print server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in CUPS. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code using specially
crafted streams, IPP requests or files, or cause a Denial of Service
(daemon crash or hang). A local attacker may be able to gain escalated
privileges or overwrite arbitrary files. Furthermore, a remote attacker
may be able to obtain sensitive information from the CUPS process or
hijack a CUPS administrator authentication request.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.4.8-r1"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since September 03, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
