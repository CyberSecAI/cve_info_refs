| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c0)  Michael Schröder    2004-06-08 13:57:07 UTC  ``` If a malicious creates a hardlink to a buggy s-bit program the  system is still compromised even after a fixed version has been  installed. The attached fix removes the s-bits from files that  get updated.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c1)  Michael Schröder    2004-06-08 13:57:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 100965](attachment.cgi?id=100965&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=100965&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c2)  Matthew Miller    2005-04-26 16:37:56 UTC  ``` Fedora Core 2 is now maintained by the Fedora Legacy project for security updates only. If this problem is a security issue, please reopen and reassign to the Fedora Legacy product. If it is not a security issue and hasn't been resolved in the current FC3 updates or in the FC4 test release, reopen and change the version to match.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c3)  Michael Schröder    2005-04-26 16:48:43 UTC  ``` Hmm, good question. I leave it to your security group to decide if it's a  security issue or not. For now, I've changed the product to FC3.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c4)  Matthew Miller    2005-04-26 17:59:40 UTC  ``` Hmmm. I can see how that might be an issue. I'm going to clone this into Fedora Legacy as well as leaving in FC3. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c5)  Paul Nasrat    2005-04-26 22:13:47 UTC  ``` Adding security group and flag - will look at thanks.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c7)  Jeff Johnson    2005-11-04 13:38:47 UTC  ``` This patch should probably be done in other ways, but is ok for what the patch does.  Patch added to rpm cvs, should be in rpm-4.4.3-0.35 when built.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c8)  Michael Schröder    2010-06-02 13:00:58 UTC  ``` (Argh, you didn't apply the chunk that removes the bits in the FSM_RENAME case! See [bug #598775](show_bug.cgi?id=598775 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2059 rpm: fails to drop SUID/SGID bits on package upgrade"))   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c9)  Jeff Johnson    2010-06-02 13:31:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 419033](attachment.cgi?id=419033 "cvs diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=419033&action=edit "cvs diff") cvs diff  Patch to FSM_RENAME case was applied on 15 Nov 2005 20:06:53 exactly as stated.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c10)  Michael Schröder    2010-06-02 14:22:33 UTC  ``` Hmm, must have been a different branch. I just see the commit by Paul done Apr 16 13:26:12 2007, which doesn't contain it. rpm-4.4.2.3 also doesn't contain the FSM_RENAME part. Anyway, what's done is done. I don't want to do any finger pointing.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c11)  Jeff Johnson    2010-06-02 14:29:25 UTC  ``` You chose to add the comment here with "you" attached.  And not a different branch, 4.4.2 (on which @rpm.org is based) != 4.4.3.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c12)  Michael Schröder    2010-06-04 09:49:17 UTC  ``` (Turns out that maybe I'm the one to blame. I seem to have dropped the chunk by accident when porting the patch from 4.1.1 to 4.4.2, and Paul took it from out version. Hard to tell after such a long time.)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c13)  Jeff Johnson    2010-06-04 12:54:07 UTC  ``` Yes its been a long time and removing setuid/setgid (and capabilities and acls and ...) is a tedious issue which (if deserving of a CVE firedrill) also means that this rpmbuild issue also needs a CVE (imho its a far more serious issue):      Name: tag with malicious syntax in spec files can be used to remove home directories:               Name: foo;~      can trick rpmbuild into removing home directories and worse.  Then there's %verifyscript that is run multiple times, and the flaw saving/restoring the chroot directory using embedded lua (also from you and incorrect).  So it goes ... *shrug* ... Have fun!   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c14)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-14 19:52:56 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned the name [CVE-2005-4889](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-4889) to this issue.  Applying the alias here as per [bug #598775 comment #27](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c27 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2059 rpm: fails to drop SUID/SGID bits on package upgrade").   ``` |  |
