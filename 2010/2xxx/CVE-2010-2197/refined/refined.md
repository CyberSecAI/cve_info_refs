- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a package containing a setuid/setgid program is updated, RPM does not remove the setuid/setgid bits from hardlinked copies of the program. This means that if a malicious user creates a hardlink to a vulnerable setuid/setgid program, updating the original program will not remove the vulnerability from the hardlinked copy.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to remove setuid/setgid bits on hardlinked copies during package updates.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can maintain access to a vulnerable program even after it has been updated by creating a hardlink to the vulnerable program before the update. This could allow the attacker to escalate privileges on the system.

- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with the ability to create hardlinks can exploit this vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user and have the ability to create hardlinks.
