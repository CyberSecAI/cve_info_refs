Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-2223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM) did not securely delete virtual machine (VM) data backends (images or volumes) when they were removed from their corresponding data domains. Specifically, the data was not properly zeroed out or overwritten.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Data Deletion:** Failure to securely delete VM data backends. This left residual data accessible in the storage domain.
- **Data Leakage:** Data from deleted VMs remained present on the storage medium, leading to a potential disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A guest user in a new, raw VM, created in a data domain that previously contained deleted VMs, could potentially read limited data from those deleted VMs, which could include sensitive information.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information stored within the deleted VM images could be exposed to unauthorized users within other VMs on the same storage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Guest-to-Guest:** A malicious or compromised guest VM could read the residual data from previously deleted VMs within the same storage domain.
- **Access to Data Domain:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create a new VM within a data domain that has previously contained deleted VMs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest User Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a guest VM.
- **Shared Data Domain:** The attacker's VM must reside within the same data domain as previously deleted VMs to access the residual data.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content also mentions that the vulnerability is addressed in RHSA-2010:0473 for `vdsm` and RHSA-2010:0476 for `rhev-hypervisor` packages.
- The fix involves ensuring that when an image or a volume is removed, the corresponding data on the data domain is securely deleted (likely by zeroing or overwriting).
- The bugzilla entry for bug 604752, provides further details on the vulnerability.
