## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0473)

## Topic

Updated vdsm packages that fix one security issue, various bugs, and add
two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM) is a management module that
serves as a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager (RHEV-M) agent on Red
Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor (RHEV-H) or Red Hat Enterprise
Linux hosts. VDSM allows RHEV-M to manage virtual machines and storage
pools, and retrieve statistics from both hosts and guests.

A flaw was found in the way VDSM handled the removal of a virtual machine's
(VM) data back end (such as an image or a volume). When removing an image
or a volume, it was not securely deleted from its corresponding data domain
as expected. A guest user in a new, raw VM, created in a data domain that
has had VMs deleted from it, could use this flaw to read limited data from
those deleted VMs, potentially disclosing sensitive information.
(CVE-2010-2223)

These updated vdsm packages also fix the following bugs:

* Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) did not use all the available memory (due

to the memory not being zero-filled) if the memory did not belong to the
Linux guest. Thus, KSM was not effective in distributing the memory to the
Linux guests with the result of shared memory being unavailable for Linux
guests. With this update, KSM allows multiple Linux guests to share the
memory. (BZ#527405)

* the vds\_bootstrap script failed when the host's temporary directory was

located on a different partition, with the following error:

[Errno 18] Invalid cross-device link using os.rename

With this update, vds\_bootstrap no longer fails. (BZ#530322)

* vds\_bootstrap failed to add a host to RHEV-M when the 'cpuspeed' and the

'libvirt' services were not found. With this update, the host is added to
RHEV-M even when the aforementioned services are not present in the system.
(BZ#538751)

* previously, vds\_bootstrap attempted to parse blank lines present in

network scripts (for example, /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0).
As a consequence, if a network script contained blank lines, vds\_bootstrap
failed and an error such as follows was written to /var/vdsm/vdsm.log (the
error example below is consequent to the blank line being present in
ifcfg-eth0):

getBridgeParams: failed to read params of file
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
Error:list index out of range

With this update, vds\_bootstrap filters blank lines in network
configuration files, ensuring it does not fail if they are present.
(BZ#540479)

* the 'pool connect' utility did not save the master domain's information

to the disk. If VDSM was restarted, auto-reconnect searched for a master
domain with the highest version. If the master domain was not available at
that time, an incorrect domain was chosen as the master. With this update,
the correct domain is chosen as the master. (BZ#543432)

* when using the RHEV-M interface to manage high-availability VMs, power

down requests were not honored. Consequently, some high-availability
virtual machines automatically rebooted instead of shutting down after they
received a command to shut down. High-availability VMs now correctly
process requests to shut down, with the result that no VMs incorrectly
reboot instead. (BZ#547112)

* after a host installation, the 'multipathd' service would restart when

the host was started from a multipath device. With this update, the
'multipathd' service no longer restarts. (BZ#547305)

These updated vdsm packages also add the following enhancements:

* previously, import/export of VMs was not supported. With this update

import/export have been implemented. (BZ#482608)

* previously, the ISO image domain could not be shared with multiple Data

Centers. The user had to define an independent ISO domain for each Data
Center. With this update, the ISO image domain can be shared between
multiple Data Centers. (BZ#496448)

All vdsm users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-06-16 16:43:15 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM) handled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an image or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely deleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a new, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it, could use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs, potentially disclosing sensitive information.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-22 12:44:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0473 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0473.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2010-06-22 13:01:36 UTC  ``` removing embargo.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-22 13:54:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0476 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0476.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c5)  Martin Prpič    2010-06-25 11:35:50 UTC  ```  Technical note added. If any revisions are required, please edit the "Technical Notes" field accordingly. All revisions will be proofread by the Engineering Content Services team.  New Contents: Previously, the ISO image domain could not be shared with multiple Data Centers. The user had to define an independent ISO domain for each Data Center. With this update, the ISO image domain can be shared between multiple Data Centers.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-06-16 16:43:15 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM) handled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an image or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely deleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a new, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it, could use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs, potentially disclosing sensitive information.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-22 12:44:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0473 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0473.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2010-06-22 13:01:36 UTC  ``` removing embargo.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-22 13:54:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0476 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0476.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c5)  Martin Prpič    2010-06-25 11:35:50 UTC  ```  Technical note added. If any revisions are required, please edit the "Technical Notes" field accordingly. All revisions will be proofread by the Engineering Content Services team.  New Contents: Previously, the ISO image domain could not be shared with multiple Data Centers. The user had to define an independent ISO domain for each Data Center. With this update, the ISO image domain can be shared between multiple Data Centers.   ``` |  |

RHSA-2010:0476 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2010-06-22
Updated:
2010-06-22
# RHSA-2010:0476 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes two security issues, multiple
bugs, and adds enhancements is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the
Linux virtio-net driver, used by guest operating systems. Due to a
deficiency in the TSO (TCP segment offloading) implementation, a guest's
virtio-net driver would transmit improper data to a certain QEMU-KVM
process on the host, causing the guest to crash. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send specially-crafted data to a target guest system,
causing that guest to crash. (CVE-2010-0741)

A flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)
handled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an
image or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely
deleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a
new, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it,
could use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs,
potentially disclosing sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2223)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for dbus issue
CVE-2009-1189; kernel issues CVE-2010-0307, CVE-2010-0410, CVE-2010-0730,
CVE-2010-1085, and CVE-2010-1086; openldap issue CVE-2009-3767; and sudo
issues CVE-2010-0426, CVE-2010-0427, and CVE-2010-1163.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds several enhancements.
Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available from
<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/2.2/html/Servers-5.5-2.2_Hypervisor_Security_Update>

As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
fixes and enhancements from the KVM updates RHSA-2010:0271 and
RHBA-2010:0419 have been included in this update. Also included are the bug
fixes and enhancements from the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)
update RHSA-2010:0473, and fence-agents update RHBA-2010:0477.

KVM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0271.html> and
<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0419.html> VDSM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0473.html> fence-agents: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0477.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues and adds these
enhancements.
