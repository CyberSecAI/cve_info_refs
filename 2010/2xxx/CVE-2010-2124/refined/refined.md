Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `firma.php` file, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in the `firma.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to access sensitive information, potentially including usernames and passwords. The provided exploit specifically targets the `ad_users` table to extract this information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `firma.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable ConPresso application.
*  **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL query such as a UNION SELECT statement.
