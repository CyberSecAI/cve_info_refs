Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2010-2757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to impersonate a user within Bugzilla without triggering the expected notification email to the impersonated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Notification Bypass:** The primary weakness is the failure to send a notification email when a user is impersonated via the 'sudo' feature. This bypass of the notification mechanism is a critical security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unnoticed Impersonation:** Attackers, with sufficient privileges, could impersonate other users without their knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data modification, or access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Manipulation:** An attacker with necessary permissions can directly manipulate the system to impersonate a user by crafting the appropriate request, bypassing the intended notification mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged User:** The attacker needs to have the ability to use the "sudo" feature. This generally means they need to belong to the `bz_sudoers` group or have similar administrative rights within the Bugzilla system.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The fix implemented a token-based approach for the sudo functionality. This token is generated only when a user legitimately impersonates another through the intended system processes. It also adds a check for the token's validity with a timeout. If the token is not present, or the impersonation is invalid, then it triggers an error instead of quietly failing over to sudoer access.
- The issue is described as a "minor" security issue that needed fixing.
- Patches were created for versions 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6 of Bugzilla.
- The vulnerability was found by Bradley Baetz and the patch was created by Frédéric Buclin and Byron Jones.
