Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Word handles an uninitialized pointer when parsing a specially crafted Word file. This improper handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Pointer:** The core issue is the presence of an uninitialized pointer within the Word parsing process. This leads to unpredictable memory access and corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Complete System Control:**  An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to:
    *   Install programs
    *   View, change, or delete data
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **E-mail Attachment:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Word document as an email attachment and convince the user to open it.
*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious Word file. They would need to lure the victim to the website and then convince them to open the file. This could also be achieved through compromised websites or ads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Word File:** The attacker needs to craft a Word document that triggers the uninitialized pointer vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious Word file, either through email or by visiting a malicious website.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not require any specific user rights or privileges on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "Important" by Microsoft.
*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft Word 2002 for Windows, and Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac.
*   Users with fewer user rights on the system are less impacted, although still at risk.
*   Microsoft recommends applying the provided update as soon as possible.
