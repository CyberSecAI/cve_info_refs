{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The stonith-ng code in pacemaker and cluster-glue passed STONITH (power switch) passwords as command-line parameters to the `stonith` binary.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information (STONITH passwords) via command-line arguments.",
      "Insecure handling of sensitive credentials."
    ],
    "impact": "Local attackers could gain access to STONITH passwords, potentially allowing them to disrupt the High Availability (HA) stack's operation by controlling power switches and other fencing actions.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system where pacemaker and cluster-glue are running.",
       "Access to the process list (ps output) to view the command-line arguments used to execute the `stonith` binary."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to view process information. No specific elevated privileges are mentioned other than those necessary to view process information."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The fix involves modifying the `stonith` binary to accept configuration via environment variables instead of command-line arguments and modifying `fence_legacy` to pass parameters through the environment. A patch was created for pacemaker, and a versioned dependency on cluster-glue >= 1.0.6 was recommended to ensure the fix is in place."
