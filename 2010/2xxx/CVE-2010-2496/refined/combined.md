| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c0)  Lars Marowsky-Bree   2010-07-08 08:44:32 UTC  ``` The new stonith-ng code passes the stonith parameters via the commandline - fence_legacy execs the "stonith" binary.  This leaks passwords and is considered a security breach, since the power switch passwords can be used to wreak some havoc, and normal users can get access to this.  The interface between fence_legacy/stonith needs to be reworked - preferably by the stonith binary also accepting them via environment variables (passing via a temporary file seems error-prone). Or, possibly, calling the library routines directly ...?  I would have filed this upstream, but since it is a security issue, prefer that we have a confidential bugzilla report to track it.   Dejan, can you please work with Andrew on this? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2010-07-08 11:27:03 UTC  ``` The SWAMPID for this issue is 34404. This issue was rated as moderate. Please submit fixed packages as soon as possible. Also create a patchinfo file using this link: <https://swamp.suse.de/webswamp/wf/34404> ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c7)  Dejan Muhamedagic   2010-07-08 13:17:18 UTC  ``` I'm not very familiar with stonith-ng and don't know how difficult it would be to switch to library calls, i.e. the way it used to be with the previous stonithd.  Of course, we can also modify stonith(8) to get the parameters from the environment. I guess that that'd be the easiest way.  Andrew, how would you like to handle this? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c8)  Forgotten User H4RxIVg0eW   2010-07-08 13:57:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c7)) > I'm not very familiar with stonith-ng and don't know how difficult it would be > to switch to library calls, i.e. the way it used to be with the previous > stonithd. >  > Of course, we can also modify stonith(8) to get the parameters from the > environment.

No, I meant to say that it can read them from a file - that is also secure, but creating/deleting a temporary file is not necessarily the easiest way.  > If not, implementing such a feature is probably the best way forward.  Yes, that'd at least be my suggestion:  - Modify stonith binary to accept environment variables (Well, it does so to a limited degree; if they are set, they'll get passed on to the fencing agent, but it'll complain that none were set on the commandline; maybe disabling this is all that is needed for the stonith binary?)  - Modify fence_legacy to push them into the environment instead ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c10)  Marcus Meissner   2010-07-08 15:19:05 UTC  ``` I requested a CVE number from Josh Bressers at Redhat (who maintains the oss sec CVE pool).  If we have final patches I would like to share them with the private security vendor list (or if they are public then already) with the public list. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c11)  Dejan Muhamedagic   2010-07-08 15:19:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c9)) > - Modify stonith binary to accept environment variables > (Well, it does so to a limited degree; if they are set, they'll get passed on > to the fencing agent, but it'll complain that none were set on the commandline; > maybe disabling this is all that is needed for the stonith binary?)  No, they're not taken from the environment, but I already implemented that part.  > - Modify fence_legacy to push them into the environment instead  This is easy, apart from the fact that it'd fail miserably if used with the older cluster-glue. I'll add the -V option to stonith to print the version. That can be used then in fence_legacy to find out whether the program can take the configuration from the environment. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c12)  Lars Marowsky-Bree   2010-07-08 15:30:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c11))  > This is easy, apart from the fact that it'd fail miserably if used with the > older cluster-glue.

Unnecessary, IMHO; can be handled trivially in the package version dependencies. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c13)  Marcus Meissner   2010-07-08 15:48:26 UTC  ``` CVE-2010-2496 ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c14)  Dejan Muhamedagic   2010-07-09 18:01:21 UTC  ``` The cluster-glue part is ready:  changeset:   2417:596a5c4c0df4 user:        Dejan Muhamedagic <dejan@hello-penguin.com> date:        Thu Jul 08 17:43:13 2010 +0200 summary:     Low: stonith: add -V (version) to stonith  changeset:   2416:9c6ea6b6bf56 user:        Dejan Muhamedagic <dejan@hello-penguin.com> date:        Thu Jul 08 16:36:36 2010 +0200 summary:     Dev: stonith: update error messages  changeset:   2415:b28b89af0aba user:        Dejan Muhamedagic <dejan@hello-penguin.com> date:        Thu Jul 08 16:25:17 2010 +0200 summary:     Medium: stonith: add -E option to get the configuration from the environment  The cluster-glue is also released as 1.0.6 upstream.  The pacemaker (fence_legacy) fix will be attached. The fix doesn't include version testing. Either add that or do package dependency as Lars suggested. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c15)  Dejan Muhamedagic   2010-07-09 18:02:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 374969](attachment.cgi?id=374969&action=diff "pacemaker patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=374969&action=edit "pacemaker patch") pacemaker patch ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c16)  Lars Marowsky-Bree   2010-07-12 12:31:47 UTC  ``` Dejan, thanks. I think both patches look good, the pacemaker patch should be accompanied by a versioned dependency on cluster-glue >= 1.0.6 (or a conflict with < 1.0.6) though to the pacemaker.spec file. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c17)  Dejan Muhamedagic   2010-07-13 13:47:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c16)) > Dejan, thanks. I think both patches look good, the pacemaker patch should be > accompanied by a versioned dependency on cluster-glue >= 1.0.6 (or a conflict > with < 1.0.6) though to the pacemaker.spec file.  Right, though in that case the user has to take all of the cluster-glue changes up to 1.0.6, not just the changesets quoted above. Perhaps a more appropriate mechanism would be to add something like  Provides: stonith-configuration-environment  in cluster-glue.spec and then Require that in pacemaker.spec. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c18)  Lars Marowsky-Bree   2010-07-13 14:28:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c17))  > Provides: stonith-configuration-environment >  > in cluster-glue.spec and then Require that in pacemaker.spec.  Too complex. If distro packagers want to backport just that one fix, they can do it themselves. Please don't introduce this upstream. Please. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c19)  Lars Marowsky-Bree   2010-07-21 10:14:57 UTC  ``` Submitted upstream and fixed internally, queued for maintenance update. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c20)  Swamp Workflow Management   2010-09-21 15:16:33 UTC  ``` Update released for: cluster-glue, cluster-glue-debuginfo, cluster-glue-debugsource, cmirrord, cmirrord-debuginfo, cmirrord-debugsource, corosync, corosync-debuginfo, corosync-debugsource, drbd, drbd-bash-completion, drbd-debuginfo, drbd-debugsource, drbd-heartbeat, drbd-kmp, drbd-kmp-debug, drbd-kmp-debuginfo, drbd-kmp-debugsource, drbd-kmp-default, drbd-kmp-ec2, drbd-kmp-pae, drbd-kmp-ppc64, drbd-kmp-s390, drbd-kmp-trace, drbd-kmp-vmi, drbd-kmp-xen, drbd-pacemaker, drbd-udev, drbd-utils, drbd-xen, hawk, ldirectord, libcorosync-devel, libcorosync4, libdlm, libdlm-debuginfo, libdlm-debugsource, libdlm-devel, libdlm2, libdlm3, libglue-devel, libglue2, libopenais-devel, libopenais2, libopenais3, libpacemaker-devel, libpacemaker3, ocfs2, ocfs2-debuginfo, ocfs2-debugsource, ocfs2-kmp-debug, ocfs2-kmp-default, ocfs2-kmp-ec2, ocfs2-kmp-kdump, ocfs2-kmp-pae, ocfs2-kmp-ppc64, ocfs2-kmp-s390, ocfs2-kmp-trace, ocfs2-kmp-vmi, ocfs2-kmp-xen, ocfs2-tools, ocfs2-tools-debuginfo, ocfs2-tools-debugsource, ocfs2-tools-devel, ocfs2-tools-o2cb, ocfs2console, openais, openais-debuginfo, openais-debugsource, pacemaker, pacemaker-debuginfo, pacemaker-debugsource, pacemaker-mgmt, pacemaker-mgmt-client, pacemaker-mgmt-debuginfo, pacemaker-mgmt-debugsource, pacemaker-mgmt-devel, release-notes-hae, resource-agents, resource-agents-debuginfo, resource-agents-debugsource, yast2-cluster Products: SLE-DEBUGINFO 11-SP1 (i386, ia64, ppc64, s390x, x86_64) SLE-HAE 11-SP1 (i386, ia64, ppc64, s390x, x86_64) ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=620781#c21)  Marcus Meissner   2021-06-21 08:10:29 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/commit/7901f43c5800374d41ae2287fe122692fe045664>   main fix:  <https://github.com/ClusterLabs/cluster-glue/commit/3d7b464439ee0271da76e0ee9480f3dc14005879>   mitre desc stonith-ng in pacemaker and cluster-glue passed passwords as commandline parameters, making it possible for local attackers to gain access to passwords of the HA stack and potentially influence its operations.
