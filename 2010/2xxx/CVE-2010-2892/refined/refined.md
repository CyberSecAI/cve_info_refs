{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Landesk web application does not sufficiently verify if a well-formed request was provided by the user who submitted the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS command injection [CWE-78]"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the web server user (gsbadmin), which has sudo privileges, allowing for complete control of the server (e.g., shutting down the firewall, loading kernel modules).",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to `drivers.php`, where the `DRIVES` parameter contains the injected OS command.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must induce the administrator to be logged into the Landesk web application in the same browser as they use to initiate the attack, potentially exploiting an XSS vulnerability in another tab."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_products": "LANDesk Management Gateway 4.0 GSBWEB v1.61s, LANDesk Management Gateway 4.2 GSBWEB v1.61. Older versions are probably affected too",
    "fixed_products": "LANDesk Management Gateway 4.0 GSBWEB v1.62, LANDesk Management Gateway 4.2 GSBWEB v1.62",
    "poc": "An HTML form is provided that sends a POST request with the injected command within the DRIVES parameter. Example: `<input type=\"text\" name=\"DRIVES\" value=\"; touch /tmp/ATTACKED\">`.",
    "workaround": "The workaround consists of renaming the vulnerable drivers.php file: `mv /usr/LANDesk/broker/webroot/gsb/drivers.php ~`."
