  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2756",
    "description": "An unprivileged user is normally not allowed to view other users' group membership. But boolean charts let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly disclosing group membership. This security fix restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user belongs to.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "2.19.1 to 3.2.7",
      "3.3.1 to 3.4.7",
      "3.5.1 to 3.6.1",

      "3.2.8",
      "3.4.8",
      "3.6.2",
      "3.7.3"
     ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the usage of group-based pronouns in boolean charts, which allows an unprivileged user to indirectly determine group membership.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized knowledge of group memberships, potentially leading to further attacks by exploiting the obtained information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited through the Search interface by using group-based pronouns in boolean charts."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged user with access to the Bugzilla search interface."
