Trustwave's SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2010-003:
Unauthorized access to root NFS export on EMC Celerra Network Attached
Storage
(NAS) appliance

https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2010-003.txt

Published: 2010-07-29 Version: 1.0

Vendor: EMC (http://www.emc.com)
Product: Celerra Unified Storage products
(http://www.emc.com/products/family/celerra-family.htm)
Version(s) affected: All

Product Description:
The Celerra Unified Storage Platform provides Network Attached Storage (NAS)
services through a combination of server appliances and software modules.

Credit: Steve Ocepek of Trustwave's SpiderLabs

CVE: CVE-2010-2860

Finding:
The Celerra appliance's NFS server freely exports its "/" file system and
enforces access using a factory-defined list of authorized IP addresses.
The
addresses found on a recent model are listed in the showmount example below,
however this list may differ depending on product version. The IP addresses
are intended for communication internal to the appliance, but are still
accepted from external sources. An attacker can mount this file system by
spoofing an authorized IP address.

The NFS showmount command can be used to obtain a list of the IP addresses:

     # showmount -e <Celerra IP address>
     Export list for <Celerra IP address>:
     / 128.221.253.101,128.221.252.101,128.221.253.100,128.221.252.100

Because the appliance's NFS server does not enable the "rootsquash" feature,
full access to the file system is possible by mounting the export using root
(UID 0).

Fully spoofing the source IP address (for sending and receiving packets)
will
usually require access to the local subnet or the ability to exploit some
other network infrastructure vulnerability. On Linux, local IP address
spoofing can be accomplished by creating an alias interface and using the
"ip route" command to set the source IP accordingly.

     # ifconfig eth0:0 128.221.253.101
     # ip route add <Celerra IP address> dev eth0 src 128.221.253.101
     # mkdir nfs
     # mount <Celerra IP address>:/ nfs

The flaw allows unauthorized access to files contained on the system,
including all CIFS shares and iSCSI mounted drives. The "/" path does not
correspond to the true root of the file system -- only the root of the user
data directory is exposed.

Vendor Response:
The vendor has acknowledged this issue and issued the following workaround.

Vendor has also published a knowledgebase article about the issue and
mitigation so support can help any customers who call in with this issue
until
a permanent fix from EMC is available.

Vendor estimated date for a code fix is Q3 2010.

Remediation Steps:

The following recommendations were provided by the vendor.

1. Hide NFS exports and show it only based on the configured access. Setting
forceFullShowmount param to 0 (default is 1) will hide the "/" from the list
since only Control Station have access to it for administration purpose:

[root () virgil slot_3]# server_param server_3 -f mount -info
forceFullShowmount

server_3 :
name                    = forceFullShowmount
facility_name           = mount
default_value           = 1
current_value           = 1
configured_value        =
user_action             = none
change_effective        = immediate
range                   = (0,1)
description             = Forces response to showmount requests to fully
                          populate response.

[root () virgil slot_3]# server_param server_3 -f mount -modify \
forceFullShowmount -value 0

server_3 : done

After the above change, client will see only the shares he have permissions
to
access to:

/usr/sbin/showmount -e 172.24.97.3
Export list for 172.24.97.3:
/fs1 (everyone)

2. Change default IP addresses (during install or after) for internal
network
along with first step above to further minimize the exploitability.

Product team has provided additional mitigations steps that can be
implemented
by the customers to reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability:

1. Create IP-based access rules on the network equipment rejecting traffic
for
IP addresses belonging to internal Celerra network which do have own switch
for that purpose. These addresses are listed in the /etc/hosts file of the
Celerra Control Station.

2. Configure firewall(s) between Data Movers and NFS clients to reject
traffic
for IP addresses belonging to the internal Celerra network.

3. Hide NFS exports and show it only based on the configured access. Setting
forceFullShowmount param to 0 (default is 1) will hide the ³/² from the list
since only Control Station have access to it for administration purpose.

4.    Disable IP reflect

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
