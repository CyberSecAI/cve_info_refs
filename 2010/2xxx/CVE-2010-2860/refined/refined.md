{
  "CVE-2010-2860": {
    "Root cause": "The EMC Celerra NAS appliance's NFS server exports its root file system ('/') without enabling the 'rootsquash' feature and uses a factory-defined list of authorized IP addresses for access control. These IP addresses are intended for internal communication but are accepted from external sources.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure NFS export configuration: Exporting '/' without 'rootsquash'.",
      "Reliance on IP-based access control with predictable/internal IP addresses.",
      "Acceptance of internal IP addresses from external networks."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the file system, including CIFS shares and iSCSI mounted drives, by spoofing an authorized IP address and mounting the NFS export as root (UID 0). While the '/' path does not expose the true root, it exposes the root of the user data directory.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote exploitation via the network. Attacker must be able to send and receive network packets with a spoofed source IP address matching one of the authorized internal IP addresses of the Celerra appliance. This usually requires access to the local subnet or the ability to exploit some other network infrastructure vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to spoof the source IP address of network packets. Access to the network where the vulnerable Celerra appliance resides or the ability to exploit other network vulnerabilities to send packets with the spoofed source IP. Ability to use the NFS client to mount the shared filesystem."
