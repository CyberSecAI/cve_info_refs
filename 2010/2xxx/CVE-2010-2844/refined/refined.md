Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `news_show.php` script within News Office version 2.0.18. Specifically, the `n-cat` parameter is not sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means the malicious script is injected through the URL and immediately reflected back in the page's output, executing in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Malicious scripts could be used to steal session cookies, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate the victim.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious site, potentially for phishing attacks.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker might be able to modify the visual appearance of the website.
- **Information Theft:** The attacker might be able to extract sensitive data displayed on the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `n-cat` parameter and tricking a user into clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know about the vulnerable `n-cat` parameter in `news_show.php`.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to generate a URL that includes malicious JavaScript.
- **Social Engineering/User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to click on the crafted malicious URL.

**Additional Details (from content):**

- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) URL demonstrates a simple alert box being executed: `http://localhost/newsoffice/news_show.php?n-user=a&n-cat='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(0)%3C/script%3E`
- The blog post indicates that the vulnerability was reported in July 2010.
- A comment suggests that the issue was addressed in a later version of the software (nuBuilder, which seems to be related to News Office).
