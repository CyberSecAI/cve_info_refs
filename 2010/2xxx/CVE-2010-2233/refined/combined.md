How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF 4.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.2-r1"

```

All libTIFF 3.9 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.9.5-r2"

```

In the past week, LibTIFF has released new versions upstream (3.9.3,
and soon after, 3.9.4) that address a number of potentially
security-relevant issues, some of which have not been assigned CVE
identifiers.  The following issues will crash (or worse) any
application linked against LibTIFF in the trivial case of viewing a
maliciously crafted image:

1.  Out-of-bounds read in TIFFExtractData() may result in application
crash (no reference, fixed upstream).  Reported by Dan Rosenberg.

2.  Out-of-bounds read in TIFFVGetField() may result in application
crash ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/tiff/+bug/589145](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/%2Bsource/tiff/%2Bbug/589145)).
 The fix for this issue was combined with the fix for CVE-2010-2065,
but it appears to be a separate issue.  Reported by Sauli Pahlman.

3.  Memory corruption in TIFFRGBAImageGet() due to buffer overflow
([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tiff/+bug/591605](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tiff/%2Bbug/591605)).
Reported by Sauli Pahlman.

There is another series of issues that each lead to an application
crash, reported at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583081>
by Nicolae Ghimbovschi.  However, these issues may require more user
assistance, such as running specific conversion tools to process TIFF
files, and as such may not need CVE identifiers.  I thought I'd
include them for completeness:

4.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2207> ("tif_getimage
fails when flipping vertically on 64-bit platforms")

5.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2208> ("Bogus
ReferenceBlackWhite values can crash libtiff")

6.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2209> ("Assertion
failure in OJPEGPostDecode") - this one is an assertion failure and
not a segfault, so it might not need a CVE.

Finally, to avoid confusion, the following more serious issues were
also fixed and have already received CVE identifiers:

7.  Integer overflows leading to heap overflow in Fax3SetupState().
Reported by Kevin Finisterre (CVE-2010-1411).

8.  Integer overflow in TIFFFillStrip() leading to heap overflow in
TIFFReadRawStrip1().  Reported by Sauli Pahlman (CVE-2010-2065).

9.  Stack overflow when processing SubjectDistance EXIF tags allows
arbitrary code execution.  Reported by Dan Rosenberg (CVE-2010-2067).

Thanks,
Dan

This results in a crash as exhibited at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583081> --- the problem only occurs when trying to flip vertically (so that a negative toskew is used) and the data is vertically subsampled.  The attached patch fixes it. ```  ------- *Comment [#1](show_bug.cgi?id=2207#c1) From Tom Lane  2010-06-10 15:15:15* ------- ``` Minor note --- obviously there's more than one way to code this, but I adopted a style matching some other, not-buggy routines in the same file. ```  ------- *Comment [#2](show_bug.cgi?id=2207#c2) From Andrey Kiselev  2010-07-02 08:39:43* ------- ``` Tom,  Thanks for the patch, applied in 3.9 and 4.0 branches.  Best regards, Andrey ``` |

This seems to crash at least EL3 and EL4 64bit versions, though crashes don't seem related.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c12)  Tom Lane    2010-06-15 13:22:35 UTC  ``` What I've been testing is builds of the older libtiff versions on my F-11 workstation, so there might be some small discrepancies from what you see on "real" EL3/4.  I did not see crashes from this particular test case on the older branches, but that doesn't mean they couldn't happen given other circumstances.  A large fraction of the other open libtiff bugs *do* crash the older builds for me.  My feeling is that the most prudent thing to do is apply as many of the 3.9.2 fixes to the older branches as can be made to fit.  In this particular case I found that the #2207 patch doesn't seem to be needed in EL4 but the #2208 one does.  Didn't look at the EL3 code yet.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-16 09:35:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c12)) > What I've been testing is builds of the older libtiff versions on my F-11 > workstation, so there might be some small discrepancies from what you see on > "real" EL3/4.  I did not see crashes from this particular test case on the > older branches, but that doesn't mean they couldn't happen given other > circumstances.  I did try EL4 libtiff built on F-12 x86_64 and it does not crash on this file, while real EL4 x86_64 dies on divide by zero.  It happens in TIFFVStripSize due to what seems to be a different compiler optimization wrt ycbcrsubsampling[2] array.  On real EL4, values are only stored in registers, while F-12 build uses memory.  TIFFGetField is called, but it does not change ycbcrsubsampling as TIFFFieldSet returns 0.  Hence following code uses whatever ycbcrsubsampling was initialized with, possibly 0 that leads to SIGPIPE in TIFFroundup calls.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-16 12:10:05 UTC  ``` Even stranger on EL3 x86_64:  Starting program: /usr/bin/tiff2rgba [bz583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")-test2.tif /dev/null [bz583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")-test2.tif: Warning, unknown field with tag 513 (0x201) ignored.

It seems libtiff-subsampling.patch from [bug #603703](show_bug.cgi?id=603703 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - libtiff: TIFFReadEncodedStrip crash") should address this issue.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c16)  Tom Lane    2010-06-16 17:48:25 UTC  ``` Huh, I can't duplicate a crash on this file using RHEL4-U7-RC2_http-AS-x86_64 on a beaker machine.  However, I do see assorted crashes on the test files of other open libtiff bugs.  Your description sounds like this particular problem might be associated with a read of uninitialized memory, so maybe the lack of reproducibility isn't so surprising.  With the 603703 patch and some other patches I've been working on for the other issues, I get no crashes on EL4.  The EL3 case looks really odd though ... what I would expect to get is "Sorry, requested compression method is not configured" followed by exit(1), but it looks like it's trying to plow ahead anyway ...   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c17)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:32 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c18)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c19)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:15:06 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c20)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-24 16:29:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

Fedora  has stopped maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 14. It is  Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no  longer maintained.  At this time, all open bugs with a Fedora 'version' of '14' have been closed as WONTFIX.  (Please note: Our normal process is to give advanced warning of this  occurring, but we forgot to do that. A thousand apologies.)  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, feel free to reopen  this bug and simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we were unable to fix it before Fedora 14 reached end of life. If you  would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged to click on  "Clone This Bug" (top right of this page) and open it against that  version of Fedora.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.  The process we are following is described here:  <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=607198#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-23 13:42:13 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in a way libtiff handled vertically flipped (i.e. with negative toskew) images on 64bit platforms.  Numeric computation used to calculate buffer pointer was done in the way that incorrectly extended from 32bit type to 64bit, resulting in out-of-bounds writes.  For more details, refer to following bugs:   <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2207>   [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=607198#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-23 13:42:51 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of libtiff as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=607198#c2)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 14:09:43 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=607198#c3)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 14:11:07 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=607198#c4)  Fedora Update System    2010-07-01 18:42:54 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=607198#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-02 10:25:13 UTC  ``` CVE as described by Mitre:  tif_getimage.c in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and 3.9.2 on 64-bit platforms, as used in ImageMagick, does not properly perform vertical flips, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image, related to "downsampled OJPEG input."  References: <http://securitytracker.com/id?1024150> <http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/v3.9.4.html>  Reference to 3.9.4 changelog seems to be due to securitytracker.com page incorrectly stating that this is fixed in 3.9.4.  This issue is not fixed in 3.9.4, the fix is not committed in upstream CVS yet.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=607198#c6)  Fedora Update System    2010-07-05 22:00:31 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
