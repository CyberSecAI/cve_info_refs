{
  "CVE-2010-2233": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in a way libtiff handled vertically flipped (i.e. with negative toskew) images on 64bit platforms. Numeric computation used to calculate buffer pointer was done in the way that incorrectly extended from 32bit type to 64bit, resulting in out-of-bounds writes.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect type extension for negative toskew values during buffer pointer calculation on 64-bit platforms.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application or a Denial of Service condition.",
    "Attack vector": "Opening a specially crafted TIFF image file",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create/provide a malicious TIFF image file and entice a user to open it with a vulnerable application.",
        "Additional Details": "The vulnerability exists in the `tif_getimage.c` file when processing vertically flipped images. The incorrect type extension happens while calculating buffer pointers, causing out-of-bounds writes. This issue is triggered when a negative toskew value is used on 64-bit platforms."
