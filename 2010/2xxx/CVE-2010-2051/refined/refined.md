```
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `article.php` script of the DBCart online shopping application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `article.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. The `id` parameter within the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive information from the database
    - Modify or delete data in the database
    - Potentially gain control of the database server itself, depending on database user privileges

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through a web browser by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `id` parameter of the `article.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**
The exploit example provided is `http://127.0.0.1/[path]/article.php?id=9999+and+1=2+union+all+select+version(),2--`. This payload attempts to retrieve the database version, confirming that the SQL injection is possible.
