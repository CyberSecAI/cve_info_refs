# Update on the publicly disclosed Win32k.sys EoP Vulnerability

Hi everyone,

Yesterday we [tweeted](https://twitter.com/msftsecresponse) to let customers know that we were investigating a publicly disclosed vulnerability in the Windows Kernel-mode drivers (win32k.sys) affecting all supported operating systems. We are not aware of attacks that try to use the reported vulnerability or of any customer impact at this time. Today we have more information, as well as a planned course of action.

While most in the industry reported this as a low-severity vulnerability, it generated quite a bit of attention, and as always, we started our investigation as soon as we became aware of the issue. We have not yet reported on this issue because it’s important we’re thorough in our investigations, and there were a couple of possible vectors that we wanted to validate (or invalidate as the case may be) before we commented or defined a course of action.

As a result, we are now able to report that this is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability only. This type of issue allows attackers to gain system-level privileges *after* they have already obtained an account on the target system. For this issue to be exploited, an attacker must have valid log-on credentials on the target system and be able to log on locally, or must already have code running on the target system. The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely, or by anonymous users.

We will not be releasing a security advisory for this issue, but it will be included in a future security update. We will continue monitoring the threat landscape and alert customers if anything changes.

Thanks to Dustin Childs and the rest of our security engineering team for their quick and thorough work to determine the cause and extent of this issue across platforms!

Thanks,

Jerry Bryant

Group Manager, Response Communications

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
