Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the way Internet Information Services (IIS) servers with FastCGI enabled handle request headers. Specifically, a buffer overflow occurs when processing specially crafted request headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the processing of HTTP request headers. This occurs when the size of the request header exceeds the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the same privileges as the Worker Process Identity (WPI).
- **Complete System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to IIS servers with FastCGI enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending malicious requests to the web server.
- **FastCGI Enabled:** The target server must have FastCGI enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

- FastCGI is not enabled by default in IIS, which acts as a mitigating factor.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way IIS servers with FastCGI enabled handle request headers.
- The provided content also mentions a workaround of disabling FastCGI, which would prevent exploitation but also reduces functionality of FastCGI dependent modules.
- Another mitigation is the install and use of the URL Rewrite module.
