{
  "CVE-2010-2240": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-119",
      "Description": "A context-dependent attacker can execute arbitrary code via a vulnerability in a kernel memory handling function. Users must already have sufficient privileges to execute or connect clients to an Xorg server.",
       "Other_Descriptions": "When an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently overwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault occurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code, possibly leading to privilege escalation. It is known that the X Window System server can be used to trigger this flaw.",
      "Vuln_type": "Privilege Escalation/Arbitrary Code Execution"
    },
    "Technical_details": [
      {
        "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is a lack of proper separation between the process stack and mmapped memory regions in the Linux kernel, combined with how the Xorg server allocates memory.",
        "Vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises when a malicious, authenticated client of the Xorg server can cause it to allocate a large number of pixmaps which exhausts or fragments the server's address space. This brings the process stack and mmapped regions close to each other. When combined with the MIT-SHM extension, a local attacker can create a shared memory segment that gets attached near the stack. The attacker can then trigger a recursive function which extends the stack into the shared memory segment, allowing them to directly overwrite stack locations with arbitrary code.",
         "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Xorg server, often root. This means a local attacker could escalate their privileges to root, or a remote attacker who already has a foothold on a system via some other vulnerability could escalate their privileges to root. The vulnerability also causes denial of service due to memory exhaustion.",
        "Attack vector": "The attack vector involves a malicious X client that allocates a large number of pixmaps and then manipulates shared memory segments and recursive function calls.",
        "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Xorg server. In many systems, local users can start an Xorg server that does not require authentication or utilize the MIT-SHM extension. A remote attacker who has already compromised another GUI application (e.g. a web browser) may also be able to attack the X server."
      },
      {
          "Root cause": "The issue is caused due to insufficient separation between stack and other memory allocations by the Linux Kernel.",
          "Vulnerability": "A stack overflow in the Xorg server application can silently overwrite other memory mapped areas instead of triggering a segmentation fault. This is because the memory regions are too close and the stack is allowed to grow into other address space regions.",
          "Impact": "A successful exploitation will lead to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.",
          "Attack vector": "A malicious client can connect to the Xorg server and trigger the vulnerability by allocating large memory regions, which will lead to the stack pointer being placed within an arbitrary memory region which is controlled by the attacker. The malicious client then triggers a stack overflow within the Xorg application itself to overwrite stack data which points to a malicious payload and hence, arbitrary code execution.",
          "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Xorg server and use the MIT-SHM extension. A local user may be able to start an Xorg server that requires no authentication, thus local users have an easy way to exploit this vulnerability. Also, a remote attacker that has exploited another GUI application may be able to exploit this vulnerability."

     "Affected_components":[
        "Linux Kernel", "Xorg Server", "VMware ESX", "VMware ESXi"
      ],
    "Workarounds":[
      "Set a limit on the virtual memory (RLIMIT AS) used by the Xorg process to prevent exhaustion of the address space.",
      "Disable the MIT-SHM extension to make code execution more difficult, though it may impact the functionality of the server."
     ],
    "Fixes": [
        "The fix is to maintain a one-page gap between the stack and the rest of the memory areas, preventing the stack from expanding into other memory regions.",
        "Linux kernel versions including commit 320b2b8de12698082609ebbc1a17165727f4c893 are fixed. For example, 2.6.35.2 and 2.6.34.4.",
