```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The SigComp Universal Decompressor Virtual Machine could overrun a buffer.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow in SigComp Universal Decompressor Virtual Machine.
  - Impact of exploitation: It may be possible to make Wireshark crash, hang, or execute code by injecting a series of malformed packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
  - Attack vectors: Injecting malformed packets onto the wire, or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs the ability to inject network packets or craft a malicious packet trace file.
