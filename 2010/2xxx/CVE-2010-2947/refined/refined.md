Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-2947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `HX_split()` function of the libHX library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** When `HX_split()` is called with a specified maximum number of fields (4th argument != 0), and the input string contains fewer fields than the maximum, a buffer overflow occurs. This happens because the function writes beyond the allocated memory area.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a potential remote denial of service. The buffer overflow can lead to a crash when the result of `HX_split()` is freed.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a heap-based buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted. The SUSE security report mentions "attackers could exploit that to crash OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code", when referring to a different vulnerability, which shows the possibility of such exploitation in similar buffer overflow issues. However, the focus here is on the denial of service impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Services:**  The vulnerability is exploitable via network services that use libHX. This makes it remotely exploitable for services processing untrusted input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send data to a network service that uses libHX.
*   **No Authentication (potentially):** Some services using libHX may not require authentication, making exploitation easier for an attacker.
*   **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker needs to have control over the input string processed by the vulnerable `HX_split()` function in order to trigger the overflow by providing a string with less fields than the maximum allowed.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  All versions of libHX up to and including version 3.5 are affected.
*   **Patch:** The issue is resolved in a commit to the libHX git repository, which fixes the buffer overflow when too few fields are present in the input string.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS base score of 10, indicating a high severity level.

**Summary of Affected Products:**

*   Fedora (all)
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 10 SP3, 11, 11 SP1
*   openSUSE 11.1-11.3

The provided information gives a good insight into the root cause, impact, and exploitation of the CVE-2010-2947 vulnerability, which is a heap-based buffer overflow in the libHX library's HX_split() function.
