          "Root cause of vulnerability": "The wireless extensions (WEXT) ioctl interface in the Linux kernel does not properly validate the length of the data buffer provided by the user, leading to a kernel heap information leak.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Kernel heap information leak due to insufficient validation of user-provided data length in WEXT ioctl calls.",
          "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could read arbitrary kernel heap memory, resulting in information disclosure and potentially leading to further exploitation.",
          "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this via crafted ioctl calls on a wireless network interface.",

          "Attack vectors": "Local attacker executing `iwconfig` on a vulnerable system. Specifically when `essid_compat` is enabled in `net/wireless/wext-core.c`, causing `ioctl_standard_iw_point` to allocate insufficient memory for copying the essid data.",
