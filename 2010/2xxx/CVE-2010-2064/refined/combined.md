A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, leading to un-authorized disclosure of sensitive information and / or to important system files data integrity corruption.

As noted: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/06/08/3>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=599697#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-24 13:17:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=599697#c1)) > This issue affects the versions of the rpcbind package, as shipped > with Fedora release of 11, 12, and 13.  This issue did not affect those Fedora versions, it's quite possible Fedora was never affected, or was only affected for a short time long ago.  Looking at the Fedora rpcbind.spec, it contains:    RPCBDIR=/var/lib/rpcbind    [ ... ]       --with-statedir="$RPCBDIR" \  This changes location of those two files form default /tmp to safe /var/lib/rpcbind (directory is not group writeable).  I checked (strings on rpcbind) current and older (from F-8) builds and they use files form /var/lib/rpcbind.  Here is the patch that added support for specifying state dir location via configure, and it also add --with-statedir to .spec file:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=rpcbind.git;a=commitdiff;h=5af042e80a1b86c0ca2b746a520f3a5b34be2d1d>   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
