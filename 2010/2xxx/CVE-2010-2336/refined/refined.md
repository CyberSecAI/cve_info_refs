Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2010-2336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is two-fold:

1.  **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `news` parameter in the URL.
2.  **Source Code Disclosure:** The application allows for the downloading of arbitrary files, including sensitive configuration files, via the `download` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (Blind):** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `news` parameter, leading to blind SQL injection. This means that the attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially revealing sensitive data or modifying the database but without direct feedback from the server.
*   **Arbitrary File Download/Source Code Disclosure:** The application allows downloading of arbitrary files through the `download` parameter without proper access control checks. This allows access to sensitive files such as `includes/config.inc.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might gain administrative access by obtaining credentials from the database.
*   **Source Code Disclosure:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other configuration parameters, enabling them to further compromise the application and related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** HTTP GET requests with a malicious payload within the `news` parameter, example: `http://server/yamamah/?news=1[BSQLi]`.
*   **Source Code Disclosure:** HTTP GET request with the `download` parameter set to a file path such as `http://server/[path]/index.php?download=includes/config.inc.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   No authentication is needed to exploit these vulnerabilities, as they are accessible through the application's URL parameters.

**Additional Details:**
The exploit-db entry provides examples of how to exploit both vulnerabilities, including SQL injection queries and the URL to download the configuration file.
It also provides a PoC for blind SQL injection.
The SQL injection exploit leverages the `substring()` function to enumerate database information.
The file disclosure vulnerability is used to directly download sensitive configuration files.
