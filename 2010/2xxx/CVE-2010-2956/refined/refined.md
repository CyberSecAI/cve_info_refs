Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2010-2956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of Runas specifications in `sudo` when both user and group lists are defined in the `sudoers` file. Specifically, when the `-g` (run as group) command-line option was used in conjunction with the `-u` (run as user) option, `sudo` failed to properly enforce that the specified user was also authorized by the `sudoers` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Runas specification handling:** Sudo's logic did not verify that both the specified user (-u option) and group (-g option) matched the Runas_Lists in the sudoers file. It only enforced that at least one of the specified user or group was part of the configured list.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user could exploit this flaw to run commands with the privileges of a different user, including root, if the `sudoers` configuration allowed it, even if that specific user was not permitted to run commands as that user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege escalation:** A local unprivileged user could gain the ability to execute commands with the privileges of other users, including the root user, depending on the sudoers configuration. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Command-line exploitation:** An attacker must be able to use the `sudo` command with the `-u` and `-g` options.
*   **Specific sudoers configuration:** The vulnerable configuration must allow a user to run a command as a group and must have both user and group lists specified in their Runas\_Spec.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the target system.
*   **Sudo privileges:** The user needs to be authorized to use sudo for at least one command, and the sudoers entry must contain both Runas user and group list specified.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** An attacker needs to know the correct arguments to provide to sudo to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects configurations using `Runas_Spec` with both user and group lists specified in the `sudoers` file (e.g., `dgb    boulder = (operator : operator) /bin/ls`).
*   The vulnerable code is in `match.c` which was modified to perform a proper check of both user and group.
*   The bug was present in `sudo` versions 1.7.0 through 1.7.4p3.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `sudo` version 1.7.4p4
