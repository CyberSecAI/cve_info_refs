{
  "Root cause": "Improper handling of open_basedir paths.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Customers are able to add arbitrary paths via the documentroot of a domain by appending a colon to it and setting the open basedir path to use that domain documentroot."
  ],
  "Impact": "Allows customers to bypass the intended restrictions of the open_basedir, potentially gaining access to sensitive files/directories outside of their allowed documentroot.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the domain's documentroot path by appending a colon.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to modify domain settings through SysCP.  This could be an administrative user or possibly a user with delegated permissions to manage domain settings."
