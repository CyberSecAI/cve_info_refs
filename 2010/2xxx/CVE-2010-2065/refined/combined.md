## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [tiff](/security/cves?package=tiff) - TIFF image manipulation library

## Details

Kevin Finisterre discovered that the TIFF library did not correctly handle

certain image structures. If a user or automated system were tricked

into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges, or crash the application,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-1411](/security/CVE-2010-1411))

Dan Rosenberg and Sauli Pahlman discovered multiple flaws in the TIFF

library. If a user or automated system were into opening a specially

crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code

with user privileges, or crash the application, leading to a denial

of service. (Only Ubuntu 10.04 LTS was affected.) ([CVE-2010-2065](/security/CVE-2010-2065),

[CVE-2010-2067](/security/CVE-2010-2067))

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **201209-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF 4.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.2-r1"

```

All libTIFF 3.9 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.9.5-r2"

```

Here are the details from the Slackware 13.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/libtiff-3.9.4-i486-1_slack13.1.txz:  Upgraded.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-07 15:31:09 UTC  ``` Sauli Pahlman of CERT-FI provided us with fuzzed TIFF file which crashes image viewers using libtiff library.  TIFF image triggers an integer overflow in TIFFroundup() macro called from TIFFFillStrip().  Sufficient large bytecount from the file can cause TIFFroundup() to return 0 and cause TIFFReadBufferSetup() to allocate an insufficiently-sized buffer.  Later in TIFFReadRawStrip1(), application-provided read callback is called via TIFFReadFile() that possibly overflows the buffer.  This flaw occurs in libtiff 3.9.2, where bytecount in TIFFFillStrip() is defined as uint32.  Older libtiff versions (e.g. those shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5) use tsize_t (signed int32) as its type and reject bytecount values that may lead to integer overflow earlier.  Issues was reported in launchpad (bug is currently restricted): [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tiff/+bug/589565](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tiff/%2Bbug/589565)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-08 06:50:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 422062](attachment.cgi?id=422062&action=diff "Possible fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=422062&action=edit "Possible fix") Possible fix  This patch is inspired by libtiff 4.0 code. It does not do TIFFroundup() in TIFFFillStrip() (and TIFFFillTile()), as it's done in TIFFReadBufferSetup() anyway. Patch adds TIFFroundup() return value check to TIFFReadBufferSetup().   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-09 12:01:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 422514](attachment.cgi?id=422514&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=422514&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  This fix got committed upstream.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-09 12:02:41 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. These issues did not affect the versions of libtiff as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-09 17:05:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 422624](attachment.cgi?id=422624&action=diff "Updated upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=422624&action=edit "Updated upstream patch") Updated upstream patch  Avoids malloc call completely in case of integer overflow in a similar way patch in [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c2) does.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c7)  Tom Lane    2010-06-11 18:49:15 UTC  ``` Have we got an actual reproducer test case for this?  None of the standard libtiff tools crash on this image on my x86_64 box.  Perhaps the problem is 32-bit-only?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-13 08:53:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c7)) > Have we got an actual reproducer test case for this?  None of the standard > libtiff tools crash on this image on my x86_64 box.  Perhaps the problem is > 32-bit-only?      Sorry, I failed to be more clear here.  No, I was not able to reproduce with libtiff tools, but this should be reproducible with gtk-based image viewers (e.g. eog or gqview) on both 32 and 64 bits.  libtiff tools seem to use mmaped files, so they follow different if-else branch in TIFFFillStrip.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-14 07:35:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c5)) > Created an attachment (id=422624) [details] > Updated upstream patch  This patch is included in libtiff 3.9.3.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-15 07:22:42 UTC  ``` Opening bug, fix is included in tiff 3.9.3, original launchpad bug is public now too.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c13)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 14:09:28 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c14)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 14:10:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=601274#c15)  Fedora Update System    2010-07-01 18:42:42 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: libtiff4

Any application using libtiff will segfault because of a null dereference when opening the attached TIFF-file. Valgrind seems to crash when debugging eog with the attached file, but the output until the crash was:

I don't see a NULL deref here. There is a TIFFroundup() integer overflow in TIFFFillStrip() (as bytecount is 0xffffffff), that causes TIFFReadBufferSetup() to be called with size==0, so it does tif->tif\_rawdata = malloc(0). Hence TIFFReadRawStrip1() is called with insufficiently sized buffer and negative size argument (uint32 -> tsize\_t/int32 cast). It calls application-provided read callback, gtk+'s tiff\_load\_read() in this case, which tries to memcpy way too much data.

Sorry, classifying as null deref was my mistake. I accidentally left that in this report when I copy-pasted the report description from another bug report.

This should not affect libtiff 3.8.2 and earlier, as they use tsize\_t (signed int32) type for bytecount and hence values that can overflow in TIFFroundup are rejected earlier. Type change was done in tif\_read.c CVS rev 1.16, according to commit message, in response to request to support files with 2+GB size (bug <http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=890> , but that bugzilla instance is no longer running, new libtiff BZ has different bug under id 890).

Looking at the 4.0 development code, it seems this file should no longer trigger a crash there, as it uses 64bit types. Same problem should occur there if bytecount value provided by the file is 2^64-1 instead of 2^32-1 (I've not checked if (Big)TIFF format allows that, just reading the code). That version also contains following integer overflow check: ((uint64)bytecountm!=bytecount) , but it seems that check can only catch some problems (but not this one) on systems where sizeof(tmsize\_t) != sizeof(uint64).

I forgot to list this link to some mailing list posts related to libtiff bz890:

Â Â <http://www.asmail.be/msg0055287979.html>

Scratch my 4.0 note too, I missed the check in TIFFReadBufferSetup that makes sure TIFFroundup\_64 result is not 0, and which seems to be sufficient on both 32- and 64-bit Linux systems.

This patch is inspired by libtiff 4.0 code. It does not do TIFFroundup() in TIFFFillStrip() (and TIFFFillTile()), as it's done in TIFFReadBufferSetup() anyway. Patch adds TIFFroundup() return value check to TIFFReadBufferSetup().
