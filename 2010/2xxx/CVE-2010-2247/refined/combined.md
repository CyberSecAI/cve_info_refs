Subject: makepasswd: Default settings generate insecure passwords
Date: Sun, 10 Jan 2010 11:19:51 +0300
```
Package: makepasswd
Version: 1.10-4
Severity: critical
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

By default makepasswd gets 32-bit random seed from /dev/urandom, initializes
Perl random numbers generator with it using srand function and then generates
password length and password chars using rand function that is not cryptographic
secure and absolutely predictable by initial seed that is only 32 bit strength.

Default settings for makepasswd is password length from 8 to 10 characters inclusive
and password consisting of characters A-Za-z0-9 (total 62) so theoreticaly it is
possible to create 62^8+62^9+62^10 = 8.5e17 passwords in default mode. Actually
I think that security in this case better estimated by 62^8 = 2.1e14 because
all lengths have equal probability.

But because rand function depends completely on srand seed the amount of possible
passwords lowered from 8.5e17 or 2.1e14 to just 2^32 = 4.2e9. So any root user
(hence "root security hole" justification) that uses password generated by
makepasswd package is vulnerable to brute force attack. 4 billions paswords brute
force attack is quite possible.

The best solution of the issue I've found is using --rerandom=1 command line switch
that initializes srand with cryptographic secure /dev/urandom value before each rand
function call.

Thanks for your report. I agree that this is a problem we need to fix.

I'm not sure how calling srand every time would help at all, though.
Your point is that there are only 2^32 possible seeds. If we call srand
every time, then there are still only 2^32 possible seeds. In fact,
calling srand every time makes it worse; at least at the moment the
administrator can tell makepasswd to produce some large number of
passwords and select an arbitrary (if not truly random) one from that
list. Since Debian's Perl is configured to use drand48() as its
implementation of rand, there are in fact considerably more than 2^32
passwords available to an administrator following this strategy. Forcing
makepasswd to reset the random seed every time *worsens* the situation
because now there are only 2^32 possible passwords no matter how many
you tell makepasswd to generate at once, because you only ever get the
first value from the PRNG sequence.

How about we use libcrypt-openssl-random-perl instead? You can seed its
PRNG with an arbitrary amount of data; I expect 256 bits would be quite
adequate given that that's vastly more than the space of available
passwords for the default lengths, and you'd have to be generating
somewhat over 30-character passwords before you started reaching that
kind of entropy. (Plus, urandom(4) recommends reading no more than that
amount of data per invocation.)

Cheers,

No, calling srand function with 32 bit cryptographic secure random number
argument before each rand function call does _not_ make things worse and
number of available passwords is not limited by 2^32.

With this approach first char of password depends on first 4 bytes read
from /dev/urandom. The second char depends on second 4 bytes read from
/dev/urandom. The third char depends on third 4 bytes read from
/dev/urandom. And so on. But! /dev/urandom is based on cryptographic secure
pseudo random number generator so none can easily forecast next bytes given
the previous ones. I think that cryptographic strength of /dev/urandom is
256 bit so number of generated passwords using data from /dev/urandom may
be estimated to be not less than 2^256.

I think that using either of libcrypt and /dev/urandom is secure and which
one to choose is just matter of taste. To my taste system internal
cryptographic PRNG (/dev/urandom) is more tested and secure than any third
party library. And it is _already_ used by makepasswd package. So all
required to do is just ignore --rerandom key and fix this parameter value to 1.

On the other hand makepasswd has key
--randomseed=N   Use random number seed N, between 0 and 2^32 inclusive.
                 A zero value results in a real-random seed.

I think that this key should be made deprecated and disallowed at all. But
if it is absolutely necessary to allow creation of predictable (but
secure!) passwords then /dev/urandom cannot help, libcrypt should be used
instead (and range of arguments to --randomseed should be extended to 2^256).

Or for backward compatibility it is possible to use old approach (internal
rand without reseed) if --randomseed argument is specified. Anyway users of
--randomseed were warned that there are only 2^32 cases.

Cheers,
Fyodor Menshikov.

Ah, re-randomising every character rather than every password.  Right,
my mistake, sorry.

Still, from what I read in urandom(4), I think this would constitute
urandom abuse.  We don't need this much kernel randomness - a decent
userspace PRNG, properly seeded, will do fine.

I'm comfortable with using OpenSSL here.  It's already used in various
critical applications.  While it's true that its pseudo-random number
generator has had one extremely-well-publicised serious flaw in Debian,
I think sufficient eyes are on that code now that it isn't going to
happen again - and in any case many more serious things were affected by
that particular flaw, so anyone sensible changed their passwords
following it anyway.

This latter approach is the one I ended up taking.  I think it's
reasonable; anyone using this option is presumably expecting that the
values returned will remain constant across invocations, including
across upgrades of the makepasswd package.  I added a few imprecations
to the effect that this option should not normally be used.

I'd appreciate it if you could have a look at the code I just uploaded
to unstable, and review it for correctness.  You can see the diff here:

I've reviewed the code. The only possible problem I've found is in the line

my $max = 1 << ($bytes * 8);

Theoretically overflow can happen here resulting in zero or negative result
and then the program can hang in the loop below this line. But for all
reasonable values this line is just fine.

Cheers,
Fyodor Menshikov.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 31 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Automatic R runtime dependencies](/wiki/Changes/Automatic_R_runtime_dependencies "Changes/Automatic R runtime dependencies")
* [Python means Python3](/wiki/Changes/Python_means_Python3 "Changes/Python means Python3")
* [The GNU C Library version 2.30](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC230 "Changes/GLIBC230")
* [Switch RPMs to zstd compression](/wiki/Changes/Switch_RPMs_to_zstd_compression "Changes/Switch RPMs to zstd compression")
* [Changes/MinGW environment and toolchain update](/wiki/Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Golang 1.13](/wiki/Changes/golang1.13 "Changes/golang1.13")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 24th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f31
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f31. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f31 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f31
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f31-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f31 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
