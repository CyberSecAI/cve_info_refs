    {
      "cve": "CVE-2010-2654",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the IBM BladeCenter management module.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Directory Listing",
        "Unauthorized Access"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can achieve a variety of malicious actions. XSS can allow execution of arbitrary code in a victim's browser, directory traversal can allow access to sensitive OS files, and unauthorized access can expose sensitive system data (logs, cores).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating URL parameters to inject XSS payloads.",
        "Accessing the file management component with directory traversal sequences.",
         "Directly requesting sensitive files without authentication."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker may require authorization for some exploits such as directory traversal but other exploits such as XSS and unauthorized access can be done without authentication. Knowledge of the vulnerable software's URL structure is needed."
