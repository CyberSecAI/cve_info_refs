{
  "CVE-2010-2762": {
    "description": "The wrapper class `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper` (SJOW), a security wrapper that allows content-defined objects to be safely accessed by privileged code, creates scope chains ending in outer objects. Users of SJOWs which expect the scope chain to end on an inner object may be handed a chrome privileged object which could be leveraged to run arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.",
    "root_cause": "The `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper` (SJOW) class creates scope chains that can lead to outer, potentially privileged objects, instead of inner objects.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect scope chain creation in SJOW leading to access to privileged chrome objects"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious web content designed to exploit the vulnerable SJOW behavior."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to inject or manipulate content that can trigger the vulnerable SJOW behavior. This could be achieved through a crafted webpage or other malicious content.",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability was discovered by Blake Kaplan and was further investigated with contributions from Michal Zalewski. The fix involves ensuring the scope chain ends with the inner object and creating new functions instead of changing the scope of existing ones in certain rare cases."
