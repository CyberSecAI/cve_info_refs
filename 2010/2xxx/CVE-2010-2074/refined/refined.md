{
  "cveId": "CVE-2010-2074",
  "datePublished": "2010-07-29",
  "vulnerability": {
    "summary": "w3m does not handle embedded null characters in the common name and in subject alternative names of x509 certificates.",
    "details": "The w3m web browser does not properly handle embedded null characters in the common name and subject alternative names of x509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof a certificate and intercept encrypted communications. By default, w3m does not verify certificates ('ssl_verify_server' is off by default), therefore this is not exploitable in the default configuration.",
    "affectedComponents": [
      "w3m web browser"
    ],
    "rootCause": "Improper handling of null bytes in x509 certificates' common name and subject alternative names.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Certificate Spoofing"
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could spoof a certificate and intercept encrypted communications, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.",
    "attackVector": "Man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic and present a malicious certificate."
