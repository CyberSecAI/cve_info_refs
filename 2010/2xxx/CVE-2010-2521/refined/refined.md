{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `read_buf` function in the NFSv4 server code incorrectly handles page list boundaries when processing a request, leading to out-of-bounds access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Improper buffer handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can send a specially crafted NFSv4 WRITE request that, when processed by the vulnerable server, can cause a kernel panic (denial of service).  Potentially, this could lead to privilege escalation depending on the specific vulnerable implementation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "NFSv4 Protocol"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted NFSv4 WRITE requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present due to a bug in the `read_buf` function when it moves to the next page in the pagelist of a NFSv4 request. This function sets the `argp->end` pointer to a random value, which is not within the bounds of the current page. Subsequent calls to `READ_BUF` then incorrectly calculates available buffer space, leading to an out-of-bounds read. The vulnerability is triggered by specific write operations (or operations after write like getattr) that cause a page boundary to be crossed more than once when data is processed via `read_buf`."
