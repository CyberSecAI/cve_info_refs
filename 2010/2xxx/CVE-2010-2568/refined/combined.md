## Latest news

![The Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) test goes considerably farther than traditional tests: It evaluates security products in 10 realistic scenarios involving ransomware and info stealers, which utilize or combine state-of-the-art attack techniques. In doing so, the ATP test analyzes whether the defensive measures hold up in each step &ndash; or where they fail. The 12 tested products for consumer users and corporate users, running on Windows 11, are required to hold their own against techniques such as COM hijacking, reflective code loading, decoupling and low entropy encoding. Many products were up to the task, but not all. In some cases, the last firewall failed, and data was encrypted, stolen, or both.](/fileadmin/_processed_/8/8/csm_1224_ATP_Oktober24_6a1a421aac.png "ATP Test under Windows 11 –")![Our test lab subjected 14 protection products for consumers and corporate users to hundreds of extremely dangerous MacOS malware attacks on systems running Sonoma 14.6. The lab put all the security packages through tests in the categories of protection, performance and usability. And it was no easy task, as the various malware samples used in the test are some of the most malicious ones when it comes to current cyber threats. The products evaluated by the lab achieved top scores, with only a few exceptions, which leads to a noticeable increase in the security of MacOS systems.](/fileadmin/_processed_/1/a/csm_1124_aufmacher_mac_test_f855f27b76.jpg "Security solutions for MacOS Sonoma")![Cyber attackers are constantly tweaking new attack techniques, honing existing ones or combining them into an attack wave. In the latest Advanced Threat Protection test (ATP), the experts from AV-TEST examined how well protection products detect and fend off the newly developed attacks. In the test lab, 6 products for consumer users and 8 solutions for corporate users demonstrated how well they can parry attacks. In the test, attackers with ransomware and info stealers harnessed the techniques of dynamic API resolution, DLL sideloading, PowerShell ScriptBlockAst command concealment, cloaking themselves in known Windows tools. The test indicates that some protection products are hard put to deal with the attack techniques and cannot always withstand the attacks. ](/fileadmin/_processed_/3/5/csm_1024_aufmacher_atp_634fe63c38.jpg "Security software in the advanced test –")

![Many consumer users don&#039;t see themselves as being in the crosshairs of cybergangsters. A major fallacy: because attackers are constantly foraging for interesting data, passwords or e-mail log-in details. This also includes entire Windows systems, as attacking botnets are always on the lookout for new PCs to enslave. In the latest endurance test over 6 months, 13 security products show how well they go the distance in protecting systems.](/fileadmin/_processed_/6/f/csm_1024_aufmacher_dauertest_win10_11_privat_0daad402c9.jpg "Endurance test with 13 security packages ")

![Security products for consumer users and corporate users are faced with a formidable task. They have to protect systems around the clock and deal with the latest threats. Sometimes the products detect the attackers immediately &ndash; but sometimes only in a further defensive step. This is precisely the aspect examined by the Advanced Threat Protection test. In this endurance test, 31 products show how well they not only detect attackers but also how effectively they defend Windows 10 systems. The result is exciting and reveals some unforeseen surprises.](/fileadmin/_processed_/2/1/csm_0824_Aufmacher_ATP_Dauertest_1bis6_24_6af97e4f31.jpg "ATP endurance test over 6 months:")

![In addition to phishing attacks, hackers and APT groups mostly use ransomware or info stealers for attacking Windows systems. The comprehensive Advanced Threat Protection test demonstrates the fact that even after initial non-detection of an attacker, all is not lost. In this test series, the experts from AV-TEST evaluate in a step-by-step test in 10 rugged scenarios what the protection solutions are capable of &ndash; or what they are not capable of. In the latest test, the malware samples unleashed attacks with special techniques. They were concealed in scripts and installation packets or they capitalized on harmless-looking Windows shortcut files. Most of the 17 protection products for consumers and corporate users put up a vigorous and successful defense. But individual products were outsmarted in a few cases. ](/fileadmin/_processed_/0/b/csm_0824_Aufmacher_ATP_84e8af3de4.jpg "Windows protection software in the ATP Test –")

**Published**: 2010-07-19. **Last Updated**: 2010-07-20 20:06:41 UTC

**by** [Lenny Zeltser](https://zeltser.com/) (Version: 2)

[9 comment(s)](/diary/Preempting%2Ba%2BMajor%2BIssue%2BDue%2Bto%2Bthe%2BLNK%2BVulnerability%2BRaising%2BInfocon%2Bto%2BYellow/9190/#comments)

We decided to raise the [Infocon level](http://isc.sans.edu/infocon.html) to Yellow to increase awareness of the recent LNK vulnerability and to help preempt a major issue resulting from its exploitation. Although we have not observed the vulnerability exploited beyond the [original targeted attacks](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/07/experts-warn-of-new-windows-shortcut-flaw/), we believe wide-scale exploitation is only a matter of time. The proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available, and the issue is not easy to fix until Microsoft issues a patch. Furthermore, anti-virus tools' ability to detect generic versions of the exploit have not been very effective so far.

Although the original attack used the LNK vulnerability to infect systems from a USB key, the exploit can also launch malicious programs over SMB file shares. In one scenario, attackers that have access to some systems in the enterprise can use the vulnerability to infect other internal systems.

We discussed the LNK vulnerability [in a diary a few days ago](http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=9181). That note pointed to [Microsoft's advisory](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx) that described the bug "Windows Shell Could Allow Remote Code Execution," which affects most versions of Windows operating systems. Microsoft's workarounds for the issue include:

* Disable the displaying of icons for shortcuts. This involves deleting a value from the registry, and is not the easiest thing to do in some enterprise settings. Group Policy-friendly options include the use of  [Registry Client-Side Extensions](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd392560%28WS.10%29.aspx), the [regini.exe utility](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9d467a69-57ff-4ae7-96ee-b18c4790cffd) and the creation of a custom .adm file: see [Distributing Registry Changes](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727154.aspx) for details.
* Disable the WebClient service. This will break WebDAV and any services that depend on it.

Another approach to mitigate the possible LNK attack involves the [use of Didier Stevens' tool Ariad](http://blog.didierstevens.com/2010/07/18/mitigating-lnk-exploitation-with-ariad/). Note that the tool is beta-software operating in the OS kernel, so it's probably not a good match for enterprise-wide roll-out.

Additional recommendations for making the environment resilient to an attack that exploits the LNK vulnerability include:

* Disable auto-run of USB key contents. This would address one of the exploit vectors. For instructions, see Microsoft [KB967715](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715).
* Lock down SMB shares in the enterprise, limiting who has the ability to write to the shares.

Sadly, enterprises that are likely to ever disable auto-run and lock down SMB file shares, probably have done this already back when the Conficker worm began spreading. Another challenge is that Windows 2000 and Windows XP Service Pack 2 are vulnerable, yet Microsoft [no longer provides security patches for these OS](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/07/support-for-windows-2000-and-windows-xp-service-pack-2-comes-to-an-end.ars). As the result, we believe most environments will be exposed until Microsoft releases a patch. We're raising the Infocon level in the hope that increased vigilance will increase enterprises' ability to detect and respond the attacks that may use the LNK vulnerability.

**Update:** Several readers recommended focusing on preventing unauthorized code from running by using approaches such as application whitelisting. For instance, Richard and Erno mentioned [AppLocker](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/enterprise/products/windows-7/features.aspx#applocker), which is an enterprise software control feature built into Windows 7. Erno wrote, "My solution is standard user accounts and Software Restriction Policy or AppLocker in Group Policy. You can block execution of any files on removable drives or network drives, or actually pretty much anywhere except system folders. In my networks I only allow execution from Windows and Program Files. Remember to apply the software restriction policy for all executable files, including libraries (dlls)." By the way, this is the kind of approach Jason Fossen and I explore in the new course we are about to debut, called [Combating Malware in the Enterprise](http://www.sans.org/security-training/combating-malware-enterprise-4492-tid).

Do you have recommendations for addressing the LNK issue? [Let us know](http://isc.sans.edu/contact.html).

If you have a 2008 Domain, you can use Group Policy Registry Client-Side Extensions to easily push out this registry mod.

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd392560%28WS.10%29.aspx

Otherwise, this registry mod can be deployed as a logon script or even pushed out using something like SMS or SCCM2K7.

Yellow is a bit premature. Especially when this is not a remote exploit.
#### Q

#### Jul 19th 20101 decade ago

Whether or not it's premature I don't know but this vulnerability concerns me more than many others I've seen recently. This could quickly turn into a worm on corporate networks if the exploit is crafted to copy itself to mapped drives. The user might not even need to be convinced to explore to that directory if the mapped drive is created at start up as the files are enumerated automatically.

All it would take is one bad USB drive and a mapped drive with a lot of users and the whole company is owned...

The problem can be much worse then the desktops of end users.

Consider a system admin using domain admin rights while logged into a file server to fix an issue with a users network share (e.g. permissions on a file, quotas ....). If that share now has the shortcut exploit and malware, the sys admin has just infected the server they are are on.

This is a realistic scenario based on daily support operation tasks for an IT Shop, let alone worrying about the more automated ways for the shortcut to be enumerated while logging into a server.

Desktops are easy enough to re-image even if you really dont want to have to do it. Servers are a much bigger problem to deal with.

For those not reading the previous post on this topic, this could get handy:

I've created a little shell extension fixing this issue. It inserts itself in front of the shell link icon handler, and calls the original one only when it's safe.

Should work on XP+, downloadable x86 and AMD64 builds.

I don't think going to yellow over this is pre-mature at all. This is a huge deal, especially for average users.

Very easy to distribute via torrents and zipped files on the various download sites.

@fifth.sentinel I agree, thats the one that really worries me. We're leaving our clients alone for the time being (hopefully ForeFront handles it), but every server is losing icons on LNK files for the time being.

My real fear is that some solid code comes out using the LNK vectors that also exploits a previous unknown privilege escalation vulnerability. Combined with some well crafted code, it would get real bad really quickly.

## Microsoft Windows automatically executes code specified in shortcut files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#940193

Original Release Date: 2010-07-15 | Last Revised: 2010-09-09

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows automatically executes code specified in shortcut (LNK and PIF) files.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows supports the use of shortcut or LNK files. A LNK file is a reference to a local file. A PIF file is a shortcut to a MS-DOS application. Clicking on a LNK or PIF file has essentially the same outcome as clicking on the file that is specified as the shortcut target. For example, clicking a shortcut to calc.exe will launch calc.exe, and clicking a shortcut to readme.txt will open readme.txt with the associated application for handling text files.  Microsoft Windows fails to safely obtain icons for shortcut files. When Windows displays Control Panel items, it will initialize each object for the purpose of providing dynamic icon functionality. This means that a Control Panel applet will execute code when the icon is displayed in Windows. Through use of a shortcut file, an attacker can specify a malicious DLL that is to be processed within the context of the Windows Control Panel, which will result in arbitrary code execution. The specified code may reside on a USB drive, local or remote filesystem, a CD-ROM, or other locations. Viewing the location of a shortcut file with Windows Explorer is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability. By default, Microsoft Windows has AutoRun/AutoPlay features enabled. These features can cause Windows to automatically open Windows Explorer when a removable drive, such as a USB thumb drive, is connected. Other applications that display file icons can be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability as well. When used in conjunction with a WebDav resource, Internet Explorer can be used as an attack vector for this vulnerability. With the case of Internet Explorer, no user interaction beyond viewing a web page is required to trigger the vulnerability.This vulnerability is being exploited in the wild to spread malware (stuxnet) that targets control systems. Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to display a specially-crafted shortcut file, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. Depending on the operating system and AutoRun/AutoPlay configuration, this can happen automatically by connecting a USB device. This vulnerability can also be triggered by viewing a web page with Internet Explorer or opening a document with Microsoft Office. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS10-046](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-046.mspx). Also consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Disable the displaying of icons for shortcuts**According to Microsoft Security Advisory 2286198:***Note*** *See* [*Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2286198*](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2286198) *to use the automated Microsoft Fix it solution to enable or disable this workaround.****Note*** *Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.*   1. *Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.* 2. *Locate and then click the following registry key:**HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\lnkfile\shellex\IconHandler* 3. *Click the File menu and select Export.* 4. *In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter LNK\_Icon\_Backup.reg and click Save.Note This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default* 5. *Select the value (Default) on the right hand window in the Registy Editor. Press Enter to edit the value of the key. Remove the value, so that the value is blank, and press Enter.* 6. *Locate and then click the following registry key:**HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\piffile\shellex\IconHandler* 7. *Click the File menu and select Export.* 8. *In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter PIF\_Icon\_Backup.reg and click Save.Note This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.* 9. *Select the value (Default) on the right hand window in the Registy Editor. Press Enter to edit the value of the key. Remove the value, so that the value is blank, and press Enter.* 10. *Log all users off and on again, or restart the computer.*  Note that this mitigation may prevent Windows shortcuts from displaying some icons.**Disable AutoRun**Disabling AutoRun can increase the amount of user interaction that is required to trigger this vulnerability. It will not block the vulnerability, however. Please see Microsoft Support article [967715](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715) for more details. Setting the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry entry to 0xFF should provide the highest amount of protection.**Use least privilege**Use "least privilege" approach to user accounts. By reducing the privileges of the user accounts, the impact of this and other vulnerabilties may be reduced. More information about this technique is available in the Microsoft TechNet article [Applying the Principle of Least Privilege to User Accounts on Windows XP](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb456992.aspx). Note that these concepts still apply to Windows Vista and newer operating systems.**Disable the WebClient service**According to Microsoft Security Advisory [2286198](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx):*Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround, it will still be possible for remote attackers who successfully exploited this vulnerability to cause Microsoft Office Outlook to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.**To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:*  1. *Click Start, click Run, type Services.msc and then click OK.* 2. *Right-click WebClient service and select Properties.* 3. *Change the Startup type to Disabled. If the service is running, click Stop.* 4. *Click OK and exit the management application.*  **Block outgoing SMB traffic**Block outgoing connections on ports 139/tcp, 139/udp, 445/tcp, and 445/udp at your network perimeter. Doing so will help prevent machines on the local network from connecting to SMB servers on the internet. While this does not remove the vulnerability, it does block an attack vector for this vulnerability. **Use a web browser other than Internet Explorer**Internet Explorer is very closely integrated with the Microsoft Windows operating system. Because of this, Internet Explorer can often be used as an attack vector for vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows operating system. In this case, Internet Explorer can be used to trigger the vulnerability with no user interaction required beyond visiting a malicious or compromised website. Other browsers appear to require additional user interaction. |

# Experts Warn of New Windows Shortcut Flaw

July 15, 2010

[91 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/07/experts-warn-of-new-windows-shortcut-flaw/#comments)

Researchers have discovered a sophisticated new strain of malicious software that piggybacks on USB storage devices and leverages what appears to be a previously unknown security vulnerability in the way **Microsoft Windows** processes shortcut files.

**[![](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/usbday-300x225.jpg "usbday")](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/usbday.jpg)**

**Update, July 16,  7:49 p.m. ET:** Microsoft just released an advisory about this flaw, available [here](http://microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx). Microsoft said it stems from a vulnerability in the “Windows shell” (Windows Explorer, e.g.) that is present in every supported version of Windows. The advisory includes steps that can mitigate the threat from this flaw.

*Original post:*

**VirusBlokAda**, an anti-virus company based in Belarus, said that on June 17 its specialists found two new malware samples that were capable of infecting a fully-patched **Windows 7** system if a user were to view the contents of an infected USB drive with a common file manager such as Windows Explorer.

USB-borne malware is extremely common, and most malware that propagates via USB and other removable drives traditionally has taken advantage of the Windows Autorun or Autoplay feature. But according to VirusBlokAda, this strain of malware leverages a vulnerability in the method Windows uses for handling shortcut files.

Shortcut files — or those ending in the “.lnk” extension — are Windows files that link (hence the “lnk” extension) easy-to-recognize icons to specific executable programs, and are typically placed on the user’s Desktop or Start Menu. Ideally, a shortcut doesn’t do anything until a user clicks on its icon. But VirusBlokAda found that these malicious shortcut files are capable of executing automatically if they are written to a USB drive that is later accessed by Windows Explorer.

“So you just have to open infected USB storage device using [Windows] Explorer or any other file manager which can display icons (for i.e. Total Commander) to infect your Operating System and allow execution of the malware,” wrote **Sergey Ulasen**, an anti-virus expert with the company, in [an advisory](http://anti-virus.by/en/tempo.shtml) published this month.

Ulasen said the malware installs two drivers: “[mrxnet.sys](http://www.virustotal.com/ru/analisis/9c891edb5da763398969b6aaa86a5d46971bd28a455b20c2067cb512c9f9a0f8-1278584177)” and “[mrxcls.sys](http://www.virustotal.com/ru/analisis/d58c95a68ae3debf9eedb3497b086c9d9289bc5692b72931f3a12c3041832628-1278584115).” These so-called “rootkit” files are used to  hide the malware itself so that it remains invisible on the USB storage device. Interestingly, Ulasen notes that both driver files are signed with the digital signature of [Realtek Semiconductor Corp](http://www.realtek.com)., a legitimate hi-tech company.

Ulasen said he reached out to Microsoft and to Realtek but got a response from neither. **Jerry Bryant**, group manager of response communications at Microsoft, told KrebsOnSecurity.com Wednesday that “Microsoft is investigating new public claims of malware propagating via USB storage devices. When we have completed our investigations we will take appropriate action to protect users and the Internet ecosystem.”

If this truly is a new vulnerability in Windows, it could soon become a popular method for spreading malware. But for now, this threat seems fairly targeted: Independent security researcher [Frank Boldewin](http://www.reconstructer.org/) said he had an opportunity to dissect the malware samples, and observed that they appeared to be looking for [Siemens WinCC SCADA systems](http://www.sea.siemens.com/us/News/Industrial/Pages/SIEMENS-WinCC-SCADA-SOFTWARE-NOW-SUPPORTS-WINDOWS-VISTA.aspx), or machines responsible for controlling the operations of large, distributed systems, such as manufacturing and power plants.

“Looks like this malware was made for espionage,” Boldewin said.

   Brian,

   Could this vulnerability be attacked through a website drive by? If it is all based on Windows proccessing the malicious LNK file could an attacker not setup a script to download the file to the user’s machine when they visited the site. Then once Windows proccess the LNK file it would try and execute its payload? Also, what about sending the malicious LNK files out as part of an email?

   Thanks

   Hello Brian!

   I want to say thanks for your interest to this problem. Your blog has helped to draw attention of community on tmphider/stuxnet and problems that connected with it.

   I hope for collaboration in the future.

   I am SO TIRED of nothing working on Vista which was NEW, and finding more and more problems, and sites like this find a flaw. HOW ABOUT A LINK OR D/L TO FIX IT? FOR ONE THING EVEN

   Disgusted Blogs, bulletins, warnings but not ONE PLACE to tell you what to do or a fix. Flaw in links, Power grid, certificates, etc, al l mentioned do you think that the average person has the TIME or KNOWLEDGE to know where to go or how to fix it. A Microsoft Bulletin, Great. No fix though.

         Thanks for that SOPHOS link Brian! That tool will really do the trick if Sophos claims are correct. It will provide a pop-up to tell you critical shortcut files are attempting to be changed.

         After installation my icons went blank, but popped back automatically after coming out of standby!

   Regarding the Siemens WinCC SCADA sw trojan, why not block execution of mrxnet.sys & mrxctl.sys via registry to mitigate spread? See Marcelo Fartura’s blog <http://goo.gl/kK0Z>

    OMG! Thanks for sharing it. Its the first time I heard about this treat.

    Thanks to the fix tool too.

    I have all my defenses patched up. how it will do it.

    Cool shortcuts, very useful. Thanks a bunch!!! I found a few move shortcuts here: <http://www.usingcomputers.co.uk/tutorials/useful-windows-shortcuts.php> its worth taking a look at combined with this article. Thanks, keep up the good posts!

    Very Cool Brian! I just read the April 2011 Vanity Fair article giving you credit for the first publication of Stuxnet, which this turned out to be. Just noticed that in Serjey’s comment though at the time it never hit me when I read your blog.

    Keep up the great work,

       Thanks, Curt. My biggest regret with that story is not knowing it would be called “Stuxnet” and including that in the headline! At the time, it looked like yet another Windows 0day, albeit with a potentially interesting twist.

       The Vanity Fair article is here:

## Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2568

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in affected versions of Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability exists because Windows incorrectly parses shortcuts in such a way that malicious code may be executed when the operating system displays the icon of a malicious shortcut file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. This update addresses a vulnerability previously discussed in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2286198](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2286198).

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-2568](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2568).

#### Mitigating Factors for Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2568

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* For the USB removable device attack vector, when AutoPlay is disabled, the user would manually have to launch Windows Explorer or a similar application and browse to the affected folder of the removable disk.

#### Workarounds for Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2568

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the displaying of icons for shortcuts**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2286198](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2286198) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround. This Fix it solution requires a restart upon completion in order to be effective. This Fix it solution deploys the workaround, and thus has the same user impact. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then select the following registry key:

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\lnkfile\shellex\IconHandler
  3. Click the **File** menu and then click **Export**.
  4. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, enter **LNK\_Icon\_Backup.reg** and then click **Save**.

     **Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  5. Select the value **(Default)** on the right pane in the Registry Editor. Press **Enter** to edit the value of the key. Delete the value, so that the value is blank, and press **Enter**.
  6. Locate and then select the following registry key:

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\piffile\shellex\IconHandler
  7. Click the **File** menu and then click **Export**.
  8. In the **Export Registry File** dialog box, enter **PIF\_Icon\_Backup.reg** and then click **Save**.

     **Note** This creates a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
  9. Select the value **(Default)** on the right pane in the Registry Editor. Press **Enter** to edit the value of the key. Delete the value, so that the value is blank, and press **Enter**.
  10. Log all users off and on again, or restart the computer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Disabling icons from being displayed for shortcuts prevents the issue from being exploited on affected systems. When this workaround is implemented, the system may display most icons as a "white" default object icon, which does impact usability. We recommend that system administrators test this workaround thoroughly prior to deployment. When the workaround is undone, all icons will reappear.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Using the interactive method

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
  3. In the **Import Registry File** dialog box, select **LNK\_Icon\_Backup.reg**, and then click **Open**.
  4. Click the **File** menu and then click **Import**.
  5. In the **Import Registry File** dialog box, select **PIF\_Icon\_Backup.reg**, and then click **Open**.
  6. Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

  Manually resetting the Registry key values to the default values

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry key:

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\lnkfile\shellex\IconHandler
  3. Reset the registry key value to:

     **{00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}**
  4. Locate and then click the following registry key:

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\piffile\shellex\IconHandler
  5. Reset the registry key value to:

     **{00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}**
  6. Restart the computer
* **Disable the WebClient service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause Microsoft Office Outlook to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block the download of LNK and PIF files from the Internet**

  Blocking the download of LNK and PIF files on the Internet Gateway provides protection against remote exploitation of these attacks. Note that the files can be transferred over WebDAV, so any blocking solution should take this protocol into account.
* **Block outbound SMB connections on the perimeter firewall**

  Blocking outbound SMB connections on the perimeter firewall reduces the risk of remote exploitation using file shares.

#### FAQ for Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2568

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When attempting to load the icon of a shortcut, the Windows Shell does not correctly validate specific parameters of the shortcut.

**What is the Windows Shell?**

The Windows user interface (UI) provides users with access to a wide variety of objects necessary for running applications and managing the operating system. The most numerous and familiar of these objects are the folders and files that reside on computer disk drives. There are also a number of virtual objects that allow the user to perform tasks such as sending files to remote printers or accessing the Recycle Bin. The Shell organizes these objects into a hierarchical namespace and provides users and applications with a consistent and efficient way to access and manage objects.

**What is a shortcut?**

A shortcut is a link to a file or program, represented by an icon. If you double-click a shortcut, the file or program opens. The shortcut is a mechanism often used to keep frequently used files in a single, easily accessed location, such as a folder or the desktop. Shortcuts are implemented as files with the LNK extension. In addition, shortcuts can also appear as PIF files when they are related to MS-DOS programs.

**Will this security update disable the workaround or Microsoft Fix it solution, if I have previously implemented it?**

No, the workaround and Microsoft Fix it solution operate independently from the security update. After the security update has been implemented, users who have applied the workaround need to undo it.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could present a removable drive to the user with a malicious shortcut file, and an associated malicious binary. When the user opens this drive in Windows Explorer, or any other application that parses the icon of the shortcut, the malicious binary will execute code of the attackerâs choice on the target system.

An attacker could also set up a malicious Web site or a remote network share and place the malicious components on this remote location. When the user browses the Web site using a Web browser such as Internet Explorer or a file manager such as Windows Explorer, Windows attempts to load the icon of the shortcut file, invoking the malicious binary. In addition, an attacker could embed an exploit in a document that supports embedded shortcuts or a hosted browser control (such as but not limited to Microsoft Office documents).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Desktop systems used to browse untrusted network shares or untrusted Web sites are most at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correctly validating the icon reference of a shortcut.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2010-2568](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2568).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

At the time this security bulletin was released, this vulnerability was being exploited by a number of malware families.

Trojan-Spy.0485

And

Malware-Cryptor.Win32.Inject.gen.2

Review

Kupreev Oleg

Ulasen Sergey

VirusBlokAda

On  the  17th  of  June,  2010  "VirusBlokAda"  company  specialists  (www.anti-virus.by/en/)  detected
new  malware  modules.  They  have  been  added  to  the  anti-virus  bases  as  Trojan-Spy.0485
(http://www.virustotal.com/ru/analisis/9c891edb5da763398969b6aaa86a5d46971bd28a455b20c20
67cb512c9f9a0f8-1278584177)
(http://www.virustotal.com/ru/analisis/d58c95a68ae3debf9eedb3497b086c9d9289bc5692b72931f3
a12c3041832628-1278584115). Files had names ~wtr4132.tmp (513536 bytes) and ~wtr4141.tmp
(25720 bytes) accordingly. Functionality of this malware includes rootkit-technologies as well.

Malware-Cryptor.Win32.Inject.gen.2

and

Propagation method

You  should  take  into  consideration  that  virus  infects  Operating  System  in  unusual  way  (without
usage of autorun.inf file) through vulnerability in processing lnk-files.

So  you  just  have  to  open  infected  USB  storage  device  using  Microsoft  Explorer  or  any  other  file
manager that can display icons ( for example Total Commander ) to infect your Operating System
and allow execution of malware program.

Below you can see screenshot of infected USB storage device in the file manager FAR (it doesn’t
infect Operating System):

From the screenshot you can see that in the USB-device root there are 2 files with tmp extension
(they are executable) and 4 files with lnk extension. The following screenshot presents one of the
lnk-files content:

Operating  System  Windows  7  Enterprise  Edition  x86  with  all  latest  updates  is  vulnerable,  that
means malware uses vulnerability that still exists and hasn’t been closed in OS Windows.

Process of system infection and hiding

Process of system infection proceeds in the following way:

1.
Both files (mrxnet.sys  and mrxcls.sys, one of them works as  driver-filter of file system and
the  second  one is  injector  of  malicious  code)  are  placed  in  the  %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers
directory. It is seen as follows in gmer anti-rootkit:

Analysis of current drivers showed that files have resources section where the following information
is presented:

Note that drivers are signed with digital signature of Realtek Semiconductor Corp.  On the 24th of
June, 2010 we sent a letter to Realtek Company containing the warning and description of current
problem. However, the reply from Relatek Company still hasn’t been received.

Files  mrxnet.sys  and  mrxcls.sys  were  also  added  to  virus  databases  of  VirusBlokAda  as
Rootkit.TmpHider
(http://www.virustotal.com/ru/analisis/0d8c2bcb575378f6a88d17b5f6ce70e794a264cdc8556c8e812
SScope.Rookit.TmpHider.2
f0b5f9c709198-1278584497)
(http://www.virustotal.com/ru/analisis/1635ec04f069ccc8331d01fdf31132a4bc8f6fd3830ac94739df9
5ee093c555c-1278661251) accordingly.

and

Two  files  (oem6c.pnf  and  oem7a.pnf,  content  of  which  is  encrypted)  are  placed  in  the

2.
%SystemRoot%\inf directory.

Malware gets execution right after system has been infected, additional system reboot isn’t needed.

Driver-filter hides ~wtr4132.tmp and ~wtr4141.tmp files and appropriate lnk-files. That’s why users
may even not notice that there are extra files on their USB-devices. Vba32 AntiRootkit (http://anti-
virus.by/en/beta.shtml) detects hidden modules in the following way:

Also  rootkit  runs  additional  threads  in  the  system  processes,  at  the  same  time  it  hides

3.
modules which started the threads. AntiRootkit gmer detects these anomalies in the following way:

4.

Rootkit installs interceptions in system processes:

Thus, current malware should be added to very dangerous category cause there is a risk of virus
epidemic at the current moment. The reasons are:

Vulnarability  of  the  operation  system  that  hasn’t  been  still  closed  is  used  for  propagation.

1.
Malware starts to hide itself right after system has been infected;

2.
Drivers that have digital signature are used for hiding. That is the reason why it is difficult to
identify  them  independently  since  antirootkits  are  misled.  Also  detection  of  these  drivers  by
antivirus companies is absent for a long time, probably because of screening these examples out
on the primary stage of processing binary files in incoming flow.

After we have added a new records to the anti-virus bases we are admitting a lot of detections of
Rootkit.TmpHider and SScope.Rookit.TmpHider.2 all over the world.

# [Vulnerability in Windows "LNK" files?](/forums/diary/Vulnerability%2Bin%2BWindows%2BLNK%2Bfiles/9181/)

**Published**: 2010-07-16. **Last Updated**: 2010-07-18 21:17:04 UTC

**by** [Joel Esler](/handler_list.html#joel-esler) (Version: 4)

[17 comment(s)](/diary/Vulnerability%2Bin%2BWindows%2BLNK%2Bfiles/9181/#comments)

We've received plenty of information over the past couple days about this alleged vulnerability in Windows's "lnk" file, and it's use against "SCADA" networks.

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/07/16/windows\_shortcut\_trojan/

http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/07/experts-warn-of-new-windows-shortcut-flaw/

UPDATE:  Two of our Handlers have copies of it now on their analyzation systems.  Thank you, we will analyze it.

UPDATE 2:  We have been notified via our comments that Symantec has definitions for this malware as well now.

-- Joel Esler | <http://blog.joelesler.net> | <http://twitter.com/joelesler>

UPDATE 3 (from Bojan):

Microsoft posted the advisory about the vulnerability in Windows Shell that has been exploited in some targeted attacks (the advisory is at <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx>).

I've tested the exploit and can confirm that it works in Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7. The exploit uses a specially crafted LNK file. This file allows the attacker to execute an arbitrary file by carefully specifying its location – the LNK file in itself does not exploit any vulnerability such as buffer overflows, for example, so it is a legitimate LNK file. The LNK file used in targeted attacks was manually crafted as some fields that are normally present, such as CreationTime, AccessTime or WriteTime are all set to 0.

I will not be posting details about how the exploit works, but here are some things that you should be aware of:

* If autorun is disabled, when a USB device with malicious LNK files is inserted, the exploit will not be triggered automatically.
* The exploit is triggered every time a folder containing a malicious LNK files is opened (for example, with Windows Explorer). It does not matter where this folder is – it does not have to be on a USB device, but in order to execute to malicious binary, the attacker has to specify its location correctly.

What makes this vulnerability extremely serious is the fact that it can be opened from any place, including remote shares, for example. The victim just has to browse to the remote share in order to trigger the vulnerability. So double check permissions on any remote shares you use in your companies (you shouldn't allow users to write in root folders, for example).

Some AV vendors started adding detection for these LNK files, although it is still very, very bad.

We will, of course, keep an eye on the development of this.

UPDATE 4 (from Bojan):

A PoC that exploits this vulnerability has been posted today. I would recommend everyone to take a look at Microsoft's advisory that is available at <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx>, especially the workarounds section ("**Disable the displaying of icons for shortcuts"****).**

Microsoft have released an advisory for this:

\* Microsoft Security Advisory (2286198)

- Title: Vulnerability in Windows Shell Could Allow

Remote Code Execution

- http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2286198.mspx

- Revision Note: V1.0 (July 16, 2010) Advisory published.

MS suggests disabling the WebClient service. Wonder what applications that breaks?

Michael, this is good news. According to http://support.microsoft.com/kb/832161 ,

'Note You can disable the WebClient service as long as you do not have to modify or write files on Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) servers.'

For a few years now, I have routinely disabled this service on every Windows PC I use since I learned that it speeds up browsing/using network shares.

I released a new version of my tool Ariad to mitigate this .LNK exploitation.

http://blog.didierstevens.com/2010/07/18/mitigating-lnk-exploitation-with-ariad/

As Ariad is a system driver and works in the Kernel, be sure to test this first on machines you can trash.

# The CPL Icon Loading Vulnerability

Unless you’re familiar with the technology of shell extensions, you might read
Microsoft’s description of the
[Shortcut Icon Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2568](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-046.mspx) as reporting a defect
in the parsing of shortcut (.LNK) files. After all, that’s what it says: “Windows
incorrectly parses shortcuts”. Knowing no better, you might take Microsoft at
its word, perhaps grumbling that Windows can’t easily be inspected because it’s
not open-source. You might form in your mind a scenario in which something that
ought to be rejected as an error in a .LNK file instead goes unnoticed such that
the code for parsing .LNK files misbehaves. You might then think that exploitation
is a matter of contriving the error so that the misbehaviour is predictable in
a way that’s useful to malware. If you’re writing about the particular exploitation
by the Stuxnet worm, you might wave your hands around these thoughts and even
turn out phrases such as “malformed .LNK file”.

If you have done anything like that in writing about either Stuxnet or the
CVE-2010-2568 vulnerability, then you have done your readers a disservice.

More than that, you deserve to be called out for it. To rephrase an old saw
about advertising budgets: half the computer security industry is wasted, but
who knows which half? One way to identify the dross might be to ask who wrote
“malformed .LNK file” as being essential to this exploitation by Stuxnet. And,
yes, I am serious even though this test would dismiss a few of the industry’s
big beasts, e.g.,
[McAfee](https://home.mcafee.com/VirusInfo/VirusProfile.aspx?key=268481)
and
[Symantec](https://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/zero-day-vulnerability-windows-w32stuxnet), who did much of the running on Stuxnet.

It certainly is true that Stuxnet plants a .LNK file on removable media such
that merely browsing the media with the Windows Explorer will load and execute
the Stuxnet component for which a pathname can be seen in the .LNK file. What
simply isn’t true is that this trick depends on the .LNK file to be malformed.
It’s not even true that the .LNK file must be “specially crafted”, which is Microsoft’s
phrase, unless we’re meant to regard every .LNK file as being specially crafted
just for specifying what it’s a shortcut to.

To say that most of the computer security industry has described either or
both of the defect and its exploitation wrongly for years is no small claim. You’ll
want not just some abstract argument that goes into Windows internals that you
have hardly any interest in and even less means of verifying. You should have
a demonstration. Stay with me and you’ll create

* a CPL module that substitutes for the malware
* and a .LNK file that loads and executes the CPL module just from being browsed.

But

* the .LNK file will be created using nothing but the ordinary Windows user
  interface for creating shortcuts
* and the same surprise execution of the CPL module will be shown without
  any .LNK file being involved.

Whatever Windows defect it is that Stuxnet exploits with its shortcut, it’s
demonstrably not that the shortcut is malformed or gets incorrectly parsed—and
Microsoft surely knows this.

## Vulnerability Reports

Microsoft’s description of CVE-2010-2568 doesn’t give anything like enough
detail that analysts could reliably find which defect is meant even if they had
the Windows source code to look through. This vulnerability is plausibly not special
in that sense. When analysts pick over the eventual fix to see what has changed,
the theory may be that they are testing whether the fix is sound, but the practical
reality for many of them is that only then do they learn what the supposedly disclosed
vulnerability actually was. To my mind, that’s bad enough for what it says of
the general usefulness of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, of Microsoft’s
attitude to that list, and of everyone else’s willingness not just to tolerate
such short shrift but to be grateful for Microsoft’s participation. What’s particularly
bad is that Microsoft’s description in this case looks like a knowing deflection.
To describe CVE-2010-2568 as any sort of parsing error is beyond any reasonable
stretch of interpretation.

A generous rationalisation of Microsoft’s description is that it is not intended
as identifying any coding error precisely. Microsoft’s aim is instead to report
that because of a recently discovered coding error, Windows has a previously unknown
vulnerability. Microsoft means only to sketch this vulnerability, to warn of risks
from how the vulnerability might be attacked, to present some workarounds, and
eventually to fix the defect. If this can all be done without pinpointing the
defect and exposing it to critical comment before the fix is ready, then so much
the better for Microsoft. But who outside Microsoft should want to play along
with that?

### Vulnerability Analysis

At best, shortcut files are involved as no more than a
vector for exploiting the defect. Where this vector
leads to in Stuxnet’s exploitation is found easily enough. Among “official” descriptions
to contrast with Microsoft’s, we do at least have
[Vulnerability Note
VU#940193](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/940193) as recording that the defect is somewhere in the Control Panel.
Any number of malware analysts have fleshed that out by running the Windows Explorer
under a debugger, browsing a directory that contains Stuxnet’s .LNK file, watching
for where LoadLibrary gets called, and reporting
in more or less detail what they see in the call stack.

There, however, they tend to leave it. Perhaps that’s all to expect of malware
analysts. What they’re meant to analyse is the malware, not Windows. Yet from
the browsing of Stuxnet’s .LNK file to the execution of Stuxnet’s code, all the
action is in Windows, not in the malware. Between the start and end of this defect’s
exploitation by Stuxnet in particular, there’s potentially a lot to miss about
the defect in general.

### The Vulnerability

The defect is in the Control Panel’s support for an age-old, long-documented
and still-supported, but arguably obscure, feature of CPL modules. It’s a particular
case of defect that all implementations of shell folders are susceptible to, but
which is specially dangerous for the Control Panel because this obscure feature
has among its consequences that items in this shell folder may need to have their
supporting code be loaded and executed just to enumerate the items or to query
their properties. This design is not of itself defective, but you would hope it
makes the Control Panel specially defensive about what counts as a Control Panel
item. It mostly is. When you open the Control Panel, all the items it even considers
showing you do at least have to be installed in one way or another.[1](#Ftn_1)
Unfortunately, when the Control Panel is asked about any one supposed Control
Panel item, it is more than a little bit too trusting that what it is being asked
about actually is an installed Control Panel item. In one case, this credulousness
means that the Control Panel, just for being asked which icon to use for a supposed
Control Panel item, can be induced to load and execute a DLL that it would otherwise
not have considered loading as a CPL module. This is the vulnerability. This is
what Stuxnet exploits.

See that Windows is not vulnerable just for loading a DLL to get an icon. True,
an icon can be in a DLL as a resource, but extracting the icon does not itself
get the DLL to execute. You might be amazed that I think to spell that out, but
look on the Internet and you will find seemingly detailed commentary that suggests
the vulnerability is that Windows loads icons from executable modules. So let’s
state clearly that the vulnerability here is not with icons in general as resources
in DLLs. It is instead that the Control Panel in particular can load a CPL module
not just to get an icon from the module’s resources but to ask the module to
choose which icon to show—and can be tricked into
loading an attacker’s code as a CPL module.

See also that a .LNK file is just one way to get this “which icon” question
delivered to the Control Panel to induce the loading of code for execution. It’s
a very effective way, especially for malware, but to finger the .LNK file as the
vulnerability is, at best, to shoot the messenger. There are other ways to put
the “which icon” question. There are other questions to put. There are other shell
folders to put them to. Looking into this bigger picture may not turn up anything
as devastating as remote code execution just from browsing a shortcut file, but
surely the looking would better be done than not.

## Demonstration

Because so many authorities on either the vulnerability itself or its exploitation
by Stuxnet have by now entrenched the idea that the fault is in the .LNK file,
it may be as well to begin the promised demonstration. Let’s forget the typical
path of malware analysis, which would trace the particular way that Stuxnet accomplishes
its trick for Stuxnet’s particular purposes. Let’s instead try to get at the generality
by reproducing only the essence of Stuxnet’s trick in a way that has nothing to
do directly with Stuxnet, or with malware, but which can occur in more or less
ordinary usage.

Please do not miss that devising a demonstration such as this is very much
easier if you already know how the relevant part of Windows works.
A computer security industry that does not invest in knowing
Windows is a security industry that does much of its work in ignorance.

What we want to show is that code of our choice can be got running just by
browsing a directory that contains a .LNK file. Of course, we have to get the
code in the right packaging for this to work and we have to make a .LNK file that
matches the code. But to show that there need be nothing remarkable, let alone
wrong, with the .LNK file, we shall create it using nothing more special than
the ordinary user-interface support of the Windows shell.

### Make A CPL Module

First, however, we need the code that will be made to run just from browsing
the .LNK file. The right packaging is a CPL module that hosts at least one CPL
item whose icon is always to be resolved dynamically. Every installed CPL module
is executed even before any Control Panel items that are hosted by the module
are ever launched. That each module may turn out to support multiple items is
one reason for this implicit execution. Another is that each item in a module
can have its own icon, display name and description, and these too are all discovered
by executing the module. After one execution though, these properties are typically
cached so the module is never again executed just to rediscover them but only
executes again if one of its Control Panel items actually is launched. A Control
Panel item can, however, override this caching. It can indicate that it wants
the corresponding CPL module to be loaded and called when the item’s icon, display
name or description is next sought. Providing for this is where the Control Panel
has the exploitable bug.

In case the point is not sufficiently plain that this behaviour for CPL modules
is not itself a bug, but truly was intended all along as a feature, and even as
a documented feature, it may be as well to reproduce
from Microsoft’s CPL.H file that defines the CPL\_DYNAMIC\_RES
constant for programmers:[2](#Ftn_2)

```
#define CPL_DYNAMIC_RES 0
/* This constant may be used in place of real resource IDs for the idIcon,
*  idName or idInfo members of the CPLINFO structure.  Normally, the system
*  uses these values to extract copies of the resources and store them in a
*  cache.  Once the resource information is in the cache, the system does not
*  need to load a CPL unless the user actually tries to use it.
*  CPL_DYNAMIC_RES tells the system not to cache the resource, but instead to
*  load the CPL every time it needs to display information about an item.  This
*  allows a CPL to dynamically decide what information will be displayed, but
*  is SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than displaying information from a cache.
*  Typically, CPL_DYNAMIC_RES is used when a control panel must inspect the
*  runtime status of some device in order to provide text or icons to display.
*  It should be avoided if possible because of the performance hit to Control Panel.
*/
```

Still, though the provision for a CPL module to leave an item’s icon to be
resolved dynamically is ancient, a CPL module that actually does use the provision
isn’t something you’re certain to have already—and any that you do have, such
as a very common one from NVIDIA, won’t be designed to show their execution except
when launching them is deliberate. For a demonstration of surprise execution,
you’ll have to write your own CPL module or trust mine. The following would be
very nearly minimal, given that we want at least some sign that it runs, but with
a few extra lines so that we also have some confirmation of what runs:

```
#include    <windows.h>
#include    <cpl.h>

#pragma comment (lib, "kernel32.lib")   // for GetModuleFileName
#pragma comment (lib, "user32.lib")     // for MessageBox

To make this into a CPL module, compile to taste, and then link with switches
for creating a DLL and for naming the ways that a CPL module can be called:

```
cl /c /Oxs /W3 test.cpp
```
```
link /dll /entry:DllMain /export:CPlApplet /out:test.cpl test.obj
```

The output is a small CPL module that will show a message box to ask “Did you
want me?” when the CPlApplet function is first called,
whatever the reason. Should that reason turn out to be that the module’s Control
Panel item actually is being launched, then another message box apologises for
doing next to nothing. The icon for the module’s one Control Panel item will be
a default, because CPL\_INQUIRE is handled by leaving
the icon to CPL\_NEWINQUIRE, which then doesn’t bother
providing one. As I said, it’s close to minimal:

* [download source code and x86 CPL module](_download/test_1_0_x86.zip)
  (2KB);
* [download source code and x64 CPL module](_download/test_1_0_x64.zip)
  (2KB).

Note that this small CPL module is written to work on just about any version
of 32-bit or 64-bit Windows without needing any unusual privilege or permission.
Over two decades of such versions, however, and no end of options for the look
and feel of the Windows shell overall and the Control Panel in particular, there
is bound to be some variation in behaviour. The directions attempt only broad
coverage. Depending especially on what version you test with, you may find that
some steps aren’t needed at all and that others need some adjustment or have slightly
different outcomes. If you find some difference that you believe really ought
to be singled out for detailed explanation, then please write to me about it and
I shall see what I can do.

### Add a Manifest

For complete tidiness, it’s as well that we provide a manifest. We don’t need
it for surprise execution, but you should want to test that the Control Panel
item can be launched deliberately. Without a manifest, launching a Control Panel
item may attract a complaint from the Program Compatibility Assistant for fear
of having worked incorrectly without administrative privilege. The following manifest
is close to minimal:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<assembly xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1" xmlns:asmv3="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3" manifestVersion="1.0">
  <trustInfo xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3">
    <security>
      <requestedPrivileges>
        <requestedExecutionLevel level="asInvoker"/>
      </requestedPrivileges>
    </security>
  </trustInfo>
</assembly>
```

Such a manifest can be built into the CPL file as a resource, but the build
(and its description) is less complicated if we simply save the manifest as a
separate file in the same directory as the CPL file and with the same name but
with .manifest appended, e.g., test.cpl.manifest.

### Install

If you have sufficient privilege, then perhaps the easiest way to install a
CPL module is to copy it to the Windows System directory. The standard way, however,
is to list the module in the registry. Among the possibilities, the following
ordinarily needs no unusual permission:

| Key: | HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\CPLs |
| --- | --- |
| Value: | anything, e.g., Test |
| Type: | REG\_SZ or REG\_EXPAND\_SZ |
| Data: | path\test.cpl |

After editing this into the registry, open the Control Panel, and check that
an item named Test appears. Classic View is best for simplicity, but if you prefer
Category View and want to stick with it, look in the Additional Options category
or under All Control Panel Items.

See that merely to get the Test item to show in the Control Panel involves
loading it and calling its CPlApplet function. Indeed,
its “Did you want me?” message box may show multiple times, which means that our
CPL module is not just loaded, but is loaded and unloaded, over and over. Watch
out, by the way, for message boxes that lurk behind the Control Panel or do not
turn up immediately.

#### Quirks

Less something to watch out for than a problem you would have to work at encountering
is that CPL modules have an unusual constraint on filename length. Starting with
Windows XP SP2, a CPL module will not load, and thus its Control Panel items will
not show, if the total filename, i.e., including the
path, exceeds 250 characters (not including a terminating null). This is
because these versions insist that the nine characters of “.manifest” can be added
without exceeding the usual limit of MAX\_PATH characters
(including a terminating null). The manifest file doesn’t have to exist but there
must be room for composing its name.[3](#Ftn_3)

Something else you might do with the filename, e.g., to make mischief for the
directions I present above, doesn’t stop the Test item from showing but does change
the behaviour. If you installed the CPL module on a
path that contains a space or if you gave it a filename that contains a
space, then browsing the Control Panel may cause the “Did you want me?” message
box to show just once. Try it. Rename the CPL module to “space test.cpl”, edit
the registry data accordingly, and then close and reopen the Control Panel (or
just Refresh, if the option is available and meaningful).

For full appreciation, however, take this diversion a little further. Copy
the CPL module to “space.dll” in the same directory. Now refreshing the Control
Panel gives you multiple message boxes, as when the filename is space-free. But
look at each message box’s title to see what got loaded. (If the full title doesn’t
show for the message box itself, hover over the corresponding button on the task
bar and look instead at the tooltip.) The first message box is for the CPL module
as installed, i.e., as “space test.cpl”. The second (or more) occurs because the
Control Panel decides by itself to run the copy that we made as space.dll.

This—which, by the way, may fairly be called a parsing error—is just one example
of how this old, old code for supporting the Control Panel allows all sorts of
fun and games at the margins of expected usage. That I divert you for a sampling
of such quirks is not for amusement. If anything, I’m with you in regarding them
as arcane. They can be tedious to track down and describe accurately, let alone
to make them fun to read about. Fixing them probably isn’t much fun, either. To
the malware writer, however, arbitrage between what the programmer expected and
what the program actually does is bread and butter, if not serious business. Not
all edge cases are exploitable, but a good proportion are, and the Windows shell
abounds with them, both old and new. Dismissing them is a luxury we cannot afford.

### Make a Shortcut

With our CPL module installed simply as test.cpl and with the Control Panel
still open, right-click on the Test icon and choose Create Shortcut from the context
menu. If you don’t like to disturb your desktop—and why should you?—then instead
do a Ctrl-Shift drag to create the shortcut at a location of your choice. Either
way, note that even something as seemingly inert as creating a shortcut to this
Control Panel item gets the corresponding CPL module loaded and executed. Indeed,
a Ctrl-Shift drag becomes rather complex (and uncertain) because of the interruptions
from the message box.

Play with the shortcut. For instance, ask the Windows Explorer to show the
shortcut’s Properties, and confirm that the shortcut is indeed to the Control
Panel item named Test, rather than to the CPL module that is the file named test.cpl.
Again, this operation that you might think should be inert gets the CPL module
loaded and executed. You can’t even delete the shortcut file, via the Windows
Explorer, without the CPL module getting loaded and executed.

The shortcut has recorded that, if only at the time the shortcut was created,
its target is not just a Control Panel item but is one of those inconvenient Control
Panel items that doesn’t want its icon to be cached but means instead to choose
its icon dynamically. Because of this dynamic resolution of the icon, if you browse
the directory that you placed the shortcut in, the CPL module that hosts the target
item must be loaded and executed just to find what icon to show for the shortcut.

Be sure to test that last point before proceeding. It is your confirmation
that executing this type of CPL module merely for browsing
a shortcut file is ordinary Windows behaviour, with no malware in sight and no
contrivance either.

#### Quirks

One way you likely will not get this confirmation is if the CPL module’s filename
(including its path) contains a space. If you stayed with the diversion presented
above, so that the CPL module is named “space test.cpl” and the shortcut is to
the Test item as hosted by “space test.cpl”, then browsing the directory that
contains the shortcut file does not cause “space test.cpl” to execute. It does,
however, execute whatever “space.dll” is present!

### Uninstall

Though the repeated loading, executing and unloading of a CPL module that reports
dynamic resources is undeniably inefficient, it is not of itself defective. Indeed,
the type of CPL module that we have created to cause all this activity is documented
and supported, admittedly with strong advice against it because of the inefficiency,
but also with a suggestion that the behaviour may be desirable to someone, so
that a Control Panel item’s appearance can change according to the current state
of whatever the item exists to control. What we have here is not a bug. It is
very definitely an intended feature.

What would be defective is if any of this loading,
executing and unloading occurred without the shortcut’s target actually being
an installed Control Panel item. You will have guessed already that it does, because
that’s obviously where the demonstration is leading.

To uninstall our CPL module, simply delete what we added to the
CPLs key. You might think that our Test item must
now be gone from the Control Panel. And indeed it is. Refresh the Control Panel,
log off and back on, or even restart Windows. Whatever you do now that our CPL
module is uninstalled, browsing the Control Panel does not show the Test item
and does not execute the test.cpl file.

How boring is that? We created a particular type of CPL module, installed it,
created a shortcut to the Control Panel item it hosts, uninstalled it, and can’t
be the slightest bit surprised to find that the Control Panel item doesn’t show
in the Control Panel. You may even be wondering why I put you to all this work.

The point, of course, is that we have now reproduced in a controlled way the
essence of Stuxnet’s exploitation. True, we had to write our own CPL module of
a particular type. And we had to create a shortcut file. But we did so using the
ordinary user interface for creating a shortcut to anything. The shortcut is certainly
not a “malformed .LNK file” and neither is it “specially crafted”. All that is
notable about the shortcut is that it specifies as its target a Control Panel
item that was installed but is not now.

### Icon Loading With Shortcut File

So, browse to the directory where you left the shortcut. Do this with a Windows
that does not have CVE-2010-2568 fixed and you’ll see that the CPL module still
executes even though it has been uninstalled. In a real exploitation, the effect
would be that the attacker’s CPL module executes even though it was never installed
(on that computer). Thus does the worm get to spread.

Obviously, the uninstalled CPL module ought not get executed—certainly not
just from browsing a directory that has a stale shortcut file. Just as obviously,
the shortcut is not to blame for this unwanted behaviour.

While the CPL module was installed, the shortcut was perfectly fine. That the
CPL module is not currently installed is not the shortcut’s fault. After all,
the module may still be installed for another user. The demonstration might just
as well have two users. The first installs the module, creates a shortcut to the
item, and leaves the shortcut in a public or shared location. The second does
not install the module, but browses the directory where the first left the shortcut.
That the module gets executed for the second user is unwanted but also means that
the shortcut works properly as a shortcut. The most that can be expected of it
as inert data in a file is that it correctly holds some sort of description of
what may be (or ought once to have been) a Control Panel item. The most that can
be expected of whatever code parses the shortcut is that it delivers this description
intact to the Control Panel for interpretation. Since it does that, the unwanted
behaviour can only be the Control Panel’s.

### Icon Loading With No Shortcut File

As we shall see when we progress to the theory, the description that is contained
within the .LNK file and is passed to the Control Panel is binary data that everyone
but the Control Panel is supposed to treat as opaque. Still, if you don’t already
know the theory, you may (and arguably should) think that if the only way this
description can get to the Control Panel is from a .LNK file, then I’m just splitting
hairs and the problem is still in practice that something’s wrong with .LNK files.

So, let’s redo the demonstration but with a variation. Again, I assume you
test with a Windows that does not have CVE-2010-2568 fixed. Install our CPL module
and open the Control Panel, but instead of creating a shortcut file, drag our
Control Panel item to the Start Menu. Uninstall the CPL module. Then log off and
back on.

That the CPL module executes automatically when you log back on will, by now,
be no surprise. You may think that dragging to the Start Menu created a shortcut
file in one or another directory from which the shell cobbles together the Start
Menu, and restarting the shell automatically browses that directory. That is very
much what happens if you use the Classic Start Menu. More likely, however, you
use the new style of Start Menu. Indeed, since Windows 7 that’s all Microsoft
gives you. Dragging to the new style of Start Menu pins our Control Panel item
to the Start Menu, above the line in the left pane, but will not have created
any shortcut file. The Start Menu’s pinned list does not rely on shortcut files
but is instead recorded in the registry:

| Key: | HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartPage |
| --- | --- |
| Value: | Favorites |

The format of binary data for this value is given separately, under the heading
The Pinned List in [The Start
Menu’s Start](../../windows/shell/explorer/startmenu.htm). When we drag our Control Panel item to the new style of Start
Menu, the very same description that would have got wrapped into a .LNK file instead
gets wrapped into a different format and goes into the registry.

Whether the description of the uninstalled Control Panel item is parsed from
a shortcut file or a registry value, two things are plain. First, the description
is delivered correctly: there is no parsing error. Second, it is the Control Panel
that goes wrong: it acts on the description when arguably it ought not.

## Shell Namespace

What is this description that can be parsed from a .LNK file or registry value
for delivery to the Control Panel? The answer is a special case of what in general
a .LNK file can be a shortcut to. The general answer is very broad: any item in
the shell namespace. The overall form of the namespace is documented, but since
it evidently isn’t understood by all the malware analysts who have made a “close
inspection” of the bug or its exploitation, a brief review may help.

The shell namespace generalises what is more familiar as the directory tree
of a file system. Indeed, a point to the shell namespace is to include the accessible
file systems but to add any number of abstractions of more or less anything for
more or less any purpose. A shell namespace item that can contain other items
is called a shell folder. It is supported by executable code, especially a COM
interface (see below), that defines the folder as a container of items and is
responsible for access to the contained items, some of which may in turn be folders.
This code is specified as loosely as possible to support common behaviour without
constraining the implementation. That different folders can have very different
implementations is primarily what gives the namespace its generality.

### PIDLs

Each item’s path in the namespace has a structural form, known properly as
an ITEMIDLIST but colloquially as a PIDL (especially
in code that has a Pointer to an ID List). A PIDL is a sequence of variable-sized
SHITEMID structures which each represent one item
in the namespace. Successive items have a parent-child relationship. In an absolute
PIDL, the first item is relative to the root of the namespace, i.e., to the desktop,
so that the whole PIDL is unique to one item in the whole namespace.

The formal specification of an SHITEMID is just
a (16-bit) word to be followed immediately by unspecified data. The word gives
the total size in bytes, i.e., of the word and the data. An empty
SHITEMID is just zero as a word. The point to the
unspecified data is that its interpretation is entirely a matter for the shell
folder that contains the item. PIDLs are designed to be shared among all parties
with an interest in a shell namespace item but to be opaque to everyone who isn’t
actually responsible for containing the item within the namespace.

Importantly, the sharing of PIDLs is intended to allow that the interest in
a shell namespace item may be expressed at different times, in different Windows
sessions, and even on different computers. As Microsoft’s documentation puts it,
the unspecified data in a PIDL is to be “persistable and transportable”. PIDLs
are designed to be saved for later reference. Where they get persisted to or transported
to can be just about anywhere. How they are saved doesn’t matter either, as long
as they can be recovered (presumably intact). As if to prove the point, there
are shell functions for reading and writing a PIDL to an arbitrary stream (see
[IStream\_ReadPidl](../../../studies/windows/shell/shlwapi/api/util/istream/readpidl.htm) and
[IStream\_WritePidl](../../../studies/windows/shell/shlwapi/api/util/istream/writepidl.htm)). We have already seen, in the demonstration, that
PIDLs can get saved in binary data for registry values. Through all the years
of 32-bit Windows, PIDLs have plausibly been saved in any number of proprietary
file formats. In ordinary practice, however, the most common storage of PIDLs
in files is provided by the Windows shell in the form of shortcut files, usually
with the .LNK extension for their filenames.

### Shortcut Files as PIDL Containers

A .LNK file is the shell’s own container for the convenient saving of an absolute
PIDL for an arbitrary item so the item can easily be accessed another time from
wherever the container has been left. As a container, a .LNK file may have properties
of its own and may also specify ways that the target item is to be accessed, but
the target item itself is specified entirely by the PIDL.

The flip side to PIDLs being essentially opaque is that once a .LNK file is
read and its PIDL is extracted in conformance to the .LNK file format, interpreting
the PIDL is no longer the responsibility of whatever code read and interpreted
the .LNK file. Interpretation of a PIDL, no matter where the PIDL came from, is
necessarily and wholly the responsibility of the succession of shell folders that
Microsoft’s documentation makes abundantly plain are the only permitted interpreters
of the unspecified data in a PIDL’s succession of SHITEMID
structures.

### PIDL Creation and Interpretation

For the purpose of this interpretation, the essence of a shell folder is its
implementation of the IShellFolder interface. It
will not surprise that most of this interface’s methods either produce PIDLs or
accept them.

Of particular interest is the EnumObjects method.
It produces an IEnumIDList interface. Repeated
calls to that interface’s Next method retrieve PIDLs
for items in the folder. Doing this is the essence of browsing the folder. It
is perhaps the primary means by which PIDLs are discovered. The secondary means
would be the ParseDisplayName method. It takes a more-or-less
human-readable name for what its caller presumably hopes is an item in the folder,
or might be creatable as an item in the folder, and produces a PIDL for that item.

Whichever way a PIDL was discovered for an item, its main usefulness is that
it can be fed back to its folder through the other IShellFolder
methods to learn more about the item or even to modify the item. An important
example, particularly in the present context of finding an icon to use for an
item, is the GetUIObjectOf method. At its simplest,
it takes a PIDL for one item and an interface ID and produces the item’s implementation
of the indicated interface. Methods of that interface can then be called to work
on the item. For instance, if the interface is IExtractIcon,
its GetIconLocation method may tell where to get an
icon for the item.

### PIDL Persistance Vulnerability

Now, as a malware analyst or security researcher reading this article, you
might (reasonably) not know enough about Windows to question Microsoft’s description
of a Windows bug, and you might (less reasonably) not let that stop you from saying
you have made a detailed study of that bug’s exploitation, but at least you can
be depended on for your security radar to sound the alarm at this general category
of code that hands out data and assumes it will come back intact, or that it will
have the same meaning by the time it comes back, or that what comes “back” ever
was passed out. You will already be wondering how many shell folders are lax with
PIDLs they might be fed, what can go wrong if any are, and whether anything that
can go wrong is exploitable by malware. You may even be wondering how many of
your colleagues and competitors have thought of this as an under-explored class
of exploitable vulnerabilities.

If a shell folder assumes that the PIDLs it can ever receive for methods such
as GetUIObjectOf must have been produced by other
methods, such as EnumObjects and
ParseDisplayName, of the same instantiation of that
shell folder, does it give malware an opportunity for mischief or exploitation?

I don’t know what answer might be found for this question in general. That
the answer is yes for the particular shell folder known as the Control Panel has
been demonstrated very well by Stuxnet—spectacularly well, even. That a worm can
get onto a computer just from browsing shortcut files on removable media, which
appears not to have been thought of much as a possibility before Stuxnet, should
mean that the answer is not just yes but a resounding yes. Yet there is no resounding,
nor even a simple yes, because as far as I can see, nobody has asked the question
in public until now. If you take one thing from this article, I should want it
to be that Microsoft’s loose talk of parsing shortcut files and malware analysts’
uninformed talk of malformed .LNK files have deflected attention from where it
is in Windows that gave this malware such alarming and novel opportunity.

[[1]](#FtnRef_1) Of the
surprisingly many ways to install Control Panel items, the only published list
I’m aware of as standing any chance of being comprehensive is my own, under
the heading Control Panel Items in my documentation of the
[ControlPanel](../../../studies/windows/shell/shell32/classes/controlpanel.htm)
class. Note, by the way, the several ways of installing into the Control Panel
without administrative privilege.

[[2]](#FtnRef_2) Except
that the last sentence was added some time between 2003 and 2006, the reproduced
comment dates from the oldest Win32 Software Development Kit that I still have
installed (from 1995).

[[3]](#FtnRef_3) Manifests
and activation contexts were new for Windows XP. That the original release and
first service pack do not have the later limit on filename length is a classic
case of a buffer overflow being accidentally harmless. The relevant code copies
the CPL module’s filename to a buffer on the stack, taking care not to exceed
the buffer’s capacity of MAX\_PATH characters.
It then appends “.manifest” without regard for overflow, but the arrangement
of local variables on the stack means that space after the buffer happens to
be not yet in use, and by the time it does get used, the filename for the manifest
is no longer needed.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
