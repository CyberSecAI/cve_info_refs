Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-2755:

**Root Cause:**

*   A regression was introduced in Firefox 3.6.7 (and also affected 1.9.2 branch) related to how plugin parameters were handled. Specifically, when an `<object>` tag had a `data` attribute set to an empty string (`data=""`) and no `src` attribute, the code would attempt to copy the empty `data` attribute to the `src` parameter, resulting in an off-by-one error. This resulted in a plugin parameter array being constructed with one extra, invalid element.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Dangling Pointer:** The core issue is that the plugin parameter array was not set up correctly, with the last element being invalid. When the plugin instance was destroyed, the code would try to `free()` the invalid pointer. In some circumstances, this could lead to freeing of a dangling pointer, which may point to attacker-controlled memory.
*   **Off-by-one Error:**  The incorrect array construction resulted from an off-by-one error in the code that determined the number of parameters passed to the plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The most immediate impact was a crash due to attempting to `free()` an invalid memory address.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Because the dangling pointer could potentially be controlled by an attacker, this vulnerability could be used for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Content:** A malicious website could craft a page with an `<object>` tag having `data=""` and no `src` attribute. When a vulnerable Firefox version loads the page and interacts with the plugin, it can trigger the crash and potential exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server/Page Hosting:** The attacker needs the ability to host a web page.
*   **No Specific User Interaction:** Simply loading the malicious webpage is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability; no user interaction or specific plugin configuration was needed beyond having a vulnerable version of the browser and a plugin which may try to dereference the provided parameter array.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **1.9.1 Branch:** The 1.9.1 branch was found to be vulnerable, but in a different way. It didn't have the memory corruption issue, as the parameter array was zeroed and the extra element was set to `NULL`. However, there was still a possibility of NULL pointer dereference inside plugin code. Therefore it was considered a non-exploitable vulnerability in 1.9.1 and a patch for this version was considered "nice to have".
*  **Regression:**  This issue was a regression introduced by a fix for a previous vulnerability.
*  **Real-World Impact:** It was noted that this bug was causing crashes on iTunes Music Store affiliate links, indicating that it had real-world impact on users.
