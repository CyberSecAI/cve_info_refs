  "CVE-2010-2226": {
    "description": "Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the xfs filesystem that allows local users to copy and read a file owned by another user, for which they only have write permissions, due to a lack of permission checking in the XFS_SWAPEXT ioctl.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of proper permission checking in the `XFS_SWAPEXT` ioctl.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate access control",
        "Incorrect file descriptor validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users with write permissions can bypass intended access restrictions and obtain read access to files they should not be able to read, leading to information disclosure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the system",
        "Use of the `XFS_SWAPEXT` ioctl"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a local user and have write permission to a file they want to exploit.",
      "other_details": [
        "The vulnerability is specific to the XFS filesystem.",
        "The vulnerability involves swapping a write-only file into a file owned by the attacker, thus gaining read access."
