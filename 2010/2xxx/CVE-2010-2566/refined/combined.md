# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-049 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in SChannel could allow Remote Code Execution (980436)

Published: August 10, 2010 | Updated: September 01, 2010

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and one privately reported vulnerability in the Secure Channel (SChannel) security package in Windows. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user visits a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through an Internet Web browser. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003; and Important for all supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by implementing RFC 5746 and additional validation on SSL responses returned by a server. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses a vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 977377](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/977377).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the TLS/SSL protocol, implemented in the Microsoft Windows SChannel authentication component. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to introduce information on a TLS/SSL protected connection, effectively sending traffic spoofing the authenticated client. This security addresses a vulnerability previously discussed in [Microsoft Security Advisory 977377](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/977377).

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3555).

#### Mitigating Factors for TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Web sites that do not host content via SSL, but only serve content via HTTP (clear text) connections are not affected.
* Internet Information Services (IIS) 6 and IIS 7 do not allow client-initiated renegotiation. This reduces the attack surface considerably. SSL sites where a user types in username and password are unlikely to be vulnerable. The most likely scenario that would allow spoofing with IIS 6 and IIS 7 is when client-side certificates are used to perform mutual authentication. This scenario is not common.
* Customers are only affected when an attacker is able to successfully conduct a man-in-the-middle attack by exploiting another vulnerability, such as a local subnet attack or DNS spoofing.

#### Workarounds for TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Enable SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert on IIS 6 and above**

  Web servers running IIS 6 and later that are affected because they require mutual authentication by requesting a client certificate can be hardened by enabling the SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert setting. This will cause IIS to prompt the client for a certificate upon the initial connection, and does not require a server-initiated renegotiation.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Setting this flag will require the client to authenticate prior to loading any element from the SSL-protected web site. This will cause the browser to always prompt the user for a client certificate upon connecting to the SSL protected web site. If mutual authentication is *not* required for the SSL protected content, users who are prompted to select a certificate can simply dismiss the dialog box to view the content over the SSL connection without having to select a client certificate to authenticate with.

  **For IIS 6:**

  Run the following command from the "c:\inetpub\adminscripts" folder in an elevated / administrator command prompt:

  `adsutil.vbs SET w3svc/<n>/SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert true`

  Where <N> represents the number of the web site to be configured (i.e. the 'Default Web Site' is 1, the next web site is 2, etc.). So for example - to protect the 'Default Web Site' created by IIS the following command would be used:

  `adsutil.vbs SET w3svc/1/SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert true`

  **For IIS 7:**

  Save the following text to a file called "Enable\_SSL\_Renegotiate\_Workaround.js"

  ```

#### FAQ for TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is a spoofing vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to introduce information on a TLS/SSL protected connection, effectively sending traffic spoofing the authenticated client.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The TLS protocol, described in RFC 2246, describes the functionality of renegotiation, which allows either peer to renegotiate the parameters of a protected connection at any point in time. An attacker who is able to leverage another attack, such as DNS spoofing or a local subnet attack, to become a man-in-the-middle on such a connection, could abuse such renegotiation functionality in order to prepend application-specific commands to a valid TLS session being set up.

In specific scenarios, the server may execute those commands in the context of the TLS/SSL authenticated client. In Windows, TLS and SSL are implemented by the Secure Channel (SChannel) security package.

**Why is a default installation of IIS 6.0 and above not affected by this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability can only be exploited when either peer of the connection is allowed to renegotiate TLS/SSL parameters. IIS prevents any client-initiated TLS/SSL renegotiation. In addition, IIS will only initiate a server-side renegotiation attempt when configured to use certificate based mutual authentication, which is a non-default setting.

Note that in deployments where the actual TLS/SSL connection is not terminated on the IIS server directly, but on a third-party SSL terminator or reverse proxy, the connection may still be susceptible to this vulnerability.

**What is a man-in-the-middle attack?**

A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attackerâs computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, all the while thinking they are communicating only with the intended user. In the case of this vulnerability, the man-in-the-middle cannot read, decrypt or alter the encrypted communication between the client and the server. The man-in-the-middle is only able to introduce a request into the TLS session that gets executed in the context of the client.

**What is mutual authentication?**

Mutual authentication is a security feature in which a client process must prove its identity to a server, and the server must prove its identity to the client, before any application traffic is sent over the client-to-server connection.

Mutual authentication requires that the client and server prove their respective identities to each other before performing any application functions. Identity can be proved through cryptographic means, as with a public key infrastructure and digital certificates.

**What is TLS?**

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol is responsible for the authentication and key exchange necessary to establish or resume secure sessions. When establishing a secure session, the Handshake Protocol manages the following:

Cipher suite negotiation

Authentication of the server and optionally, the client

Session key information exchange

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is SSL?**

SSL is a predecessor of the Transport Layer Security protocol. It performs the same functions and supports secure network communications using a combination of public and secret key technology.

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is TLS/SSL renegotiation?**

Renegotiation is a feature of the TLS and SSL protocols that allows either peer to renegotiate parameters specific to the cryptographic connection, such as encryption keys.

**What is the SChannel security package?**

The Secure Channel (SChannel) security package is a Security Support Provider (SSP) that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Internet standard authentication protocols. These components are used to implement secure communications in support of several common internet and network applications, such as web browsing. SChannel is part of the security package that helps provide an authentication service to provide secure communications between client and server.

For more information, see the MSDN article, [Secure Channel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa380123%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In vulnerable deployments, an attacker could use this vulnerability to prepend content into a legitimate, client-initiated request to a server in the context of a valid TLS/SSL-authenticated session. This vulnerability does not allow the attacker to read, decrypt, or alter encrypted traffic between client and server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting up a man-in-the-middle attack between a client and server, subsequently interrupting their connection as soon as an SSL renegotiation attempt takes place. At this point in time, the attacker can introduce a limited set of data onto the protected path, which the server will then interpret as originating from its trusted client.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability mainly affects clients used for web browsers, and the corresponding web servers, though some versions of this attack may affect other TLS/SSL protected protocols.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by implementing RFC 5746. This RFC introduces a TLS extension which cryptographically ties TLS renegotiations to the original TLS connection onto which they are performed. This allows authentication to be carried forward and later validated, and prevents the attack.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3555).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## SChannel Malformed Certificate Request Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2566

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that SChannel on a client machine validates a certificate request message sent by the server. An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through an Internet Web browser and then convince a user to view the Web site. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-2566](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2566).

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for SChannel Malformed Certificate Request Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2566

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a denial of service condition rather than remote code execution.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by SChannel insufficiently validating certificate request messages sent by the server.

**What is the SChannel security package?**

The Secure Channel (SChannel) security package is a Security Support Provider (SSP) that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Internet standard authentication protocols. These components are used to implement secure communications in support of several common internet and network applications, such as web browsing. SChannel is part of the security package that helps provide an authentication service to provide secure communications between client and server.

For more information, see the MSDN article, [Secure Channel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa380123%28vs.85%29.aspx).

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could theoretically take complete control of the affected system. However, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in Denial of Service. The system would not be able to connect to Web sites or other network resources using SSL or TLS until a restart of the system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through an Internet web browser and then convince a user to view the Web site. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where an Internet Web browser or applications that use SSL or TLS is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This update implements additional validation on SSL responses returned by a server.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.
