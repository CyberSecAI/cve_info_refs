Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Drupal Global Redirect module's lack of input validation when handling redirect requests via the 'q' query parameter. The module directly uses this parameter in a `drupal_goto` call, which normally restricts redirects to local links, but is bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, where an attacker can control the destination URL of a redirect. This bypasses the intended protection offered by `drupal_goto`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can craft malicious links that appear to point to a legitimate site but redirect users to a third-party site. This can be exploited for phishing, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
- **Trust Exploitation:** By abusing the open redirect, attackers can manipulate user trust by making a link appear legitimate, but leading to a malicious destination.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a 'q' parameter with a malicious URL.
-  The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the crafted link.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the Global Redirect module is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no special privileges on the target system other than the ability to send a crafted link to a user of the vulnerable site.
- The attacker needs to know the base URL of the vulnerable site to form the malicious URL.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was found in Drupal 6.16 with the Global Redirect module 6.x-1.2
- A patch was provided that checks if the provided URL is absolute (contains a scheme). This prevents arbitrary redirects to external sites
