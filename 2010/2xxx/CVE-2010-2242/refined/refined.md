{
  "CVE-2010-2242": {
    "Description": "Jeremy Nickurak discovered that libvirt created iptables rules with too lenient mappings of source ports. A privileged attacker in the guest could bypass intended restrictions to access privileged resources on the host.",
    "Root cause": "Libvirt's iptables rules for masquerading were too permissive, mapping privileged source ports to privileged destination ports.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configuration of iptables rules.",
      "Failure to restrict source port mapping for network connections."
    ],
    "Impact": "A privileged attacker inside a virtual machine could bypass network restrictions, gaining access to privileged resources on the host by using the same IP as a trusted host.  This could allow access to restricted services such as NFS.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "A compromised guest VM with root privileges initiates a network connection to a restricted service on the host."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute commands as root inside the guest VM.",
      "A network setup using libvirt with masquerading enabled."
    ],
	"Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability affects libvirt versions >= 0.2.0.",
		"The fix involves modifying iptables rules to only map guest requests to non-privileged ports using the --to-ports option.",
        "The issue was reported by Jeremy Nickurak."
        ]
