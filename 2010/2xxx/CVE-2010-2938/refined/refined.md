  "CVE-2010-2938": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Xen hypervisor implementation when running a system that has an Intel CPU without Extended Page Tables (EPT) support. While attempting to dump information about a crashing fully-virtualized guest, the flaw could cause the hypervisor to crash the host as well. A user with permissions to configure a fully-virtualized guest system could use this flaw to crash the host.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs because certain VMCS (Virtual Machine Control Structure) fields are accessed without proper checks to see if they are available on the hardware. Specifically, on Intel CPUs without EPT, accessing the SECONDARY_VM_EXEC_CONTROL and GUEST_PAT registers without verifying their existence causes a hypervisor crash when attempting to dump information about a crashing guest VM.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control on hardware features",
       "Lack of validation of hardware capabilities before accessing registers"
    ],
    "Impact": "The primary impact is a crash of the hypervisor host, leading to a denial of service for all virtual machines running on that host.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By configuring a crashing fully-virtualized guest system. Specifically crafted guest VM configuration is needed to trigger the issue."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to configure a fully virtualized guest system on a vulnerable hypervisor host, specifically one running on an Intel CPU without EPT support. The ability to trigger a crash within the guest VM is also required."
