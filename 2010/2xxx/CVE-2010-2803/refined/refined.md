  "CVE-2010-2803": {
    "description": "The drm_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_drv.c in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory by requesting a large memory-allocation amount.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `drm_ioctl` function in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem doesn't properly sanitize the ioctl command, allowing a caller-controlled size of memory to be allocated with `kmalloc` and copied back to user space via `copy_to_user`. This occurs regardless of whether the intended ioctl operation succeeds.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of ioctl commands and their associated sizes.",
        "Information leak due to uninitialized kernel memory being copied to user space."
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can leak kernel memory contents up to 16KB by exploiting the vulnerability in the DRM ioctl system.",
        "attack_vectors": "A local user, who has access to the DRM subsystem (e.g., local X users or members of the 'video' group), can use crafted ioctl commands to trigger the memory leak.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have local access and sufficient privileges to interact with the DRM subsystem. Specifically, they need read/write access to the dri path (typically requiring a logged-in X session or membership in the 'video' group)."
