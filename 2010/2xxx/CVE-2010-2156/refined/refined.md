{
  "CVE-2010-2156": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ISC DHCP server was vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to its failure to handle a client ID of length 0 when hashing. When a zero-length client ID is encountered, the server attempts to hash it, leading to a crash. ",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Denial of Service",
        "Improper Handling of Zero-Length Input",
          "Crash"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted DHCP request with a client ID of zero length, which will cause the DHCP server to crash.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted DHCP request containing a client ID with zero length to the targeted DHCP server",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send DHCP requests to the targeted DHCP server. "
