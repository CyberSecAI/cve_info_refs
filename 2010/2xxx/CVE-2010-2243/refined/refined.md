{
  "CVE-2010-2243": {
    "description": "A vulnerability exists in kernel/time/clocksource.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34 where on non-GENERIC_TIME systems (GENERIC_TIME=n), accessing /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource results in an OOPS.",
    "root_cause": "The timekeeper/clocksource rework missed initializing the curr_clocksource value in the !GENERIC_TIME case.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper initialization of the `curr_clocksource` variable when `GENERIC_TIME` is disabled."
    ],
    "impact": "Accessing `/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource` on systems where `GENERIC_TIME=n` results in a kernel oops, leading to a denial-of-service (system crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Reading the sysfs file `/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability. Any user with read access to the sysfs file can trigger the crash."
