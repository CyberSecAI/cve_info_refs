{
  "CVE-2010-2808": {
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way FreeType font rendering engine processed certain Adobe Type 1 Mac Font File (LWFN) fonts. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted font file that, when opened, would cause an application linked against libfreetype to crash, or, possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of certain Adobe Type 1 Mac Font File (LWFN) fonts within FreeType's font rendering engine leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause an application using libfreetype to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code by opening a specially crafted font file.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a maliciously crafted LWFN font file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a malformed font file and have it opened by a vulnerable application linked against libfreetype."
