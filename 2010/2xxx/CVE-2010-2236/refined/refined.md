Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an improper input sanitization flaw in how Red Hat Network Satellite manages monitoring probes. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the failure to properly sanitize backticks (` `) within monitoring probe inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the backtick character. This allows for the injection of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote, authenticated attacker with the necessary privileges could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server. The code would run with the privileges of the user under which the Red Hat Network Satellite monitoring service is running.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By executing code with the privileges of the monitoring service, an attacker could potentially gain elevated access to the system or other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Authenticated Attack:** The attack vector is remote and requires authentication.
*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker must have the privilege to administer monitoring probes.
*   **Specially Crafted Input:** The attacker provides specially crafted values, including backticks, within the monitoring probe options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid user with access to the Red Hat Network Satellite/Proxy system.
*   **Monitoring Probe Administration Rights:** The attacker requires the privilege to administer and modify monitoring probes.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must be able to remotely access the system hosting Red Hat Network Satellite/Proxy.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affected multiple versions of Red Hat Network Satellite (v4.0.0, v4.1.0, v4.2.0, v5.0.0, v5.1.0, v5.2.0, v5.3.0) and Red Hat Network Proxy (v5.3.0).
*   The fix for the vulnerability involves sanitizing the monitoring probe inputs by removing the backtick characters.
*   Red Hat has marked this issue as "WONTFIX" for Satellite 5 due to it being in the "Production 2" phase of its lifecycle.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in SUSE Manager as part of the referenced update SUSE-SU-2014:0222-1 by cleaning backticks from monitoring-probes where appropriate.
