  "CVE-2010-2487": {
    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in MoinMoin 1.7.3 and earlier, 1.8.x before 1.8.8, and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted content, related to (1) Page.py, (2) PageEditor.py, (3) PageGraphicalEditor.py, (4) action/CopyPage.py, (5) action/Load.py, (6) action/RenamePage.py, (7) action/backup.py, (8) action/login.py, (9) action/newaccount.py, and (10) action/recoverpass.py.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `theme.add_msg` function in MoinMoin does not properly sanitize input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper Input Sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or exploitation of browser vulnerabilities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted URLs",
        "Manipulated template parameters"
      ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to cause a user to follow a specially crafted malicious link."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "MoinMoin 1.7.3 and earlier",
      "MoinMoin 1.8.x before 1.8.8",
      "MoinMoin 1.9.x before 1.9.3"
    ],
      "fixes": {
        "debian_lenny": "1.7.1-3+lenny5",
        "debian_unstable": "1.9.3-1",
        "moin": "1.9.3 (and related fixes for 1.7 and 1.8)"
       },
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was found due to unsanitized input being passed to the `theme.add_msg` function, specifically through the 'template' parameter in URLs. The fix involves escaping the input before passing it to the function. The issue affects multiple components of MoinMoin, not just a single one. The reported vulnerability can be triggered by navigating to a URL of the form: `http://<site>/NonExistantUser?action=edit&template=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`"
