    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2078",
      "is_related": true,
      "content_type": "blog",
       "vulnerability_summary": "The blog post describes multiple vulnerabilities in DataTrack System 3.5: Persistent XSS, Directory Disclosure, and Configuration/Source Disclosure.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause for Persistent XSS is user submitted data is not properly sanitized before being rendered. For Directory Disclosure, the root cause is improper handling of specially crafted URLs. The Configuration/Source Disclosure vulnerability is caused by the ability to download forbidden file types by appending a backslash to the filename.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Directory Disclosure",
        "Configuration/Source Disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation of the XSS vulnerability can lead to malicious script execution in the user's browser. Directory disclosure can lead to the exposure of the contents of the root directory. Configuration and Source Disclosure allows unauthorized access to sensitive information from files like 'web.config'.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "XSS: Submitting a request with malicious Javascript in a user-controlled field.",
        "Directory Disclosure: Crafting a special URL that includes escaped unicode characters.",
         "Configuration/Source Disclosure: Appending a backslash character to a file path in an HTTP GET request."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to submit data to the web application through normal web interface to exploit the XSS vulnerability. No special capabilities are required to perform directory and configuration/source disclosure attacks beyond standard HTTP request manipulation. An attacker needs to be able to submit a request with a crafted URL.",
       "additional_information": "The blog provides exploit examples for each vulnerability, including a Python script for demonstrating the Configuration/Source Disclosure, making it more useful than a standard CVE description."
