  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries or displaying it back to the user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, or inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to user compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to default.asp with vulnerable parameters.",
    "HTTP GET requests to printpage.asp with vulnerable parameters."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed."
