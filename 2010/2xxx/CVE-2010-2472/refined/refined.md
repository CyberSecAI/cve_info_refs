  "CVE-2010-2472": {
    "description": "The Locale module and dependent contributed modules in Drupal 6.x before 6.16 and 5.x before version 5.22 do not sanitize the display of language codes, native and English language names properly which could allow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the 'administer languages' permission.",
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of language codes, native and English language names in the Locale module.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited via the display of unsanitized language codes, names, in the locale module of Drupal."
      ],
