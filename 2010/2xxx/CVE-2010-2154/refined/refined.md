**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the search functionality of CMScout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript to perform actions such as:
    - Steal cookies, leading to session hijacking
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the website
    - Execute other browser-based attacks.
- HTML injection could be used to display misleading content to the users of the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the search functionality of the CMScout application.
- The attacker injects malicious code (HTML or JavaScript) into the search box.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the search form on the vulnerable website, meaning they require network access to the application.
- No prior authentication or privileges are needed for this attack, making it easily exploitable by anyone who can access the search function of the website.
