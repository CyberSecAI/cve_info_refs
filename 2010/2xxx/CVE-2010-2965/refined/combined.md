## Wind River Systems VxWorks debug service enabled by default

#### Vulnerability Note VU#362332

Original Release Date: 2010-08-02 | Last Revised: 2020-09-02

---

### Overview

Some products based on VxWorks have the WDB target agent debug service enabled by default. This service provides read/write access to the device's memory and allows functions to be called.

### Description

The VxWorks WDB target agent is a target-resident, run-time facility that is required for connecting host tools to a VxWorks target system during development. WDB is a selectable component in the VxWorks configuration and is enabled by default. The WDB debug agent access is not secured and does provide a security hole in a deployed system.

It is advisable for production systems to reconfigure VxWorks with only those components needed for deployed operation and to build it as the appropriate type of system image. It is recommended to remove host development components such as the WDB target agent and debugging components (INCLUDE\_WDB and INCLUDE\_DEBUG) as well as other operating system components that are not required to support customer applications.

Consult the VxWorks Kernel Programmer's guide for more information on WDB.

Additional information can be found in ICS-CERT advisory [ICSA-10-214-01](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-214-01_VxWorks_Vulnerabilities.pdf) and on the [Metasploit Blog](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2010/08/02/shiny-old-vxworks-vulnerabilities).

### Impact

An attacker can use the debug service to fully compromise the device.

### Solution

#### Disable debug agent

Vendors should remove the WDB target debug agent in their VxWorks based products by removing the INCLUDE\_WDB & INCLUDE\_DEBUG components from their VxWorks Image.

#### Restrict access

Appropriate firewall rules should be implemented to restrict access to the debug service (17185/udp) to only trusted sources until vendors have released patches to disable it.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to HD Moore for reporting a wider scope with additional research related to this vulnerability. Earlier public reports came from Bennett Todd and Shawn Merdinger.

Security Advisory Report - OBSO-1010-01
Enabled VxWorks debug service
Creation Date: 2010-10-15
Last Update: 2010-10-15 Summary
A security researcher has identified a large number of products based on the VxWorks platform provided by Wind River Systems with a debug service enabled by default at port 17185/udp. Vulnerability Details
The debug service provides full access to the memory of an affected device and allows for memory to be written as well as functions to be called. Of the various products based on VxWorks, the following are not affected by this vulnerability: HiPath Wireless Convergence, RG 8700, optiPoint 410/420 SIP and HFA (V5). Affected Products
HiPath 3000 (HG 1500 Gateway)
HiPath 4000 (HG 35xx Gateway)
optiPoint 410/420 HFA, versions before V5
optiPoint 600 office Recommended Actions
In general, it is recommended not to attach the mentioned systems directly at the internet. Appropriate firewall rules should be implemented to restrict access to the debug service (17185/udp). The problem is solved in the following versions; an update to these or higher versions is highly recommended: HiPath 3000 V8: V8 R5.2.0
HiPath 4000 V4: V4 R4.1.12
HiPath 4000 V5: V5 R1.2.4 Please note: HiPath 3000 V7: You need to upgrade the HG 1500 gateway only. Please use V8 R5.2.0 for this. You may keep the system itself in V7. HiPath 3000 V6 and earlier have reached end of SW support; please consider an upgrade to V7 or V8
HiPath 4000 V3 and earlier have reached end of SW support; please consider an upgrade to V4 or higher. Some older, unsupported versions of optiPoint 410/420 HFA IP phones are also vulnerable. Please ensure, that V5 is installed on all phones. optiPoint 600 office has reached end of life since a few years already; an update is unfortunately not available References

#### CERT Addendum

Within the VxWorks Kernel programmers guide it states: âFor production systems, you will want to reconfigure VxWorks with only those components needed for deployed operation, and to build it as the appropriate type of system image. You will likely want to remove components required for host development support, such as the WDB target agent and debugging components (INCLUDE\_WDB and INCLUDE\_DEBUG), as well as to remove any other operating system components not required to support your application. Other considerations may include reducing the memory requirements of the system, speeding up boot time, and security issues.â

## Wind River Systems VxWorks debug service enabled by default

#### Vulnerability Note VU#362332

Original Release Date: 2010-08-02 | Last Revised: 2020-09-02

---

### Overview

Some products based on VxWorks have the WDB target agent debug service enabled by default. This service provides read/write access to the device's memory and allows functions to be called.

### Description

The VxWorks WDB target agent is a target-resident, run-time facility that is required for connecting host tools to a VxWorks target system during development. WDB is a selectable component in the VxWorks configuration and is enabled by default. The WDB debug agent access is not secured and does provide a security hole in a deployed system.

It is advisable for production systems to reconfigure VxWorks with only those components needed for deployed operation and to build it as the appropriate type of system image. It is recommended to remove host development components such as the WDB target agent and debugging components (INCLUDE\_WDB and INCLUDE\_DEBUG) as well as other operating system components that are not required to support customer applications.

Consult the VxWorks Kernel Programmer's guide for more information on WDB.

Additional information can be found in ICS-CERT advisory [ICSA-10-214-01](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-214-01_VxWorks_Vulnerabilities.pdf) and on the [Metasploit Blog](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2010/08/02/shiny-old-vxworks-vulnerabilities).

### Impact

An attacker can use the debug service to fully compromise the device.

### Solution

#### Disable debug agent

Vendors should remove the WDB target debug agent in their VxWorks based products by removing the INCLUDE\_WDB & INCLUDE\_DEBUG components from their VxWorks Image.

#### Restrict access

Appropriate firewall rules should be implemented to restrict access to the debug service (17185/udp) to only trusted sources until vendors have released patches to disable it.

### Acknowledgements

Security Advisory Report - OBSO-1010-01
Enabled VxWorks debug service
Creation Date: 2010-10-15
Last Update: 2010-10-15 Summary
A security researcher has identified a large number of products based on the VxWorks platform provided by Wind River Systems with a debug service enabled by default at port 17185/udp. Vulnerability Details
The debug service provides full access to the memory of an affected device and allows for memory to be written as well as functions to be called. Of the various products based on VxWorks, the following are not affected by this vulnerability: HiPath Wireless Convergence, RG 8700, optiPoint 410/420 SIP and HFA (V5). Affected Products
HiPath 3000 (HG 1500 Gateway)
HiPath 4000 (HG 35xx Gateway)
optiPoint 410/420 HFA, versions before V5
optiPoint 600 office Recommended Actions
In general, it is recommended not to attach the mentioned systems directly at the internet. Appropriate firewall rules should be implemented to restrict access to the debug service (17185/udp). The problem is solved in the following versions; an update to these or higher versions is highly recommended: HiPath 3000 V8: V8 R5.2.0
HiPath 4000 V4: V4 R4.1.12
HiPath 4000 V5: V5 R1.2.4 Please note: HiPath 3000 V7: You need to upgrade the HG 1500 gateway only. Please use V8 R5.2.0 for this. You may keep the system itself in V7. HiPath 3000 V6 and earlier have reached end of SW support; please consider an upgrade to V7 or V8
HiPath 4000 V3 and earlier have reached end of SW support; please consider an upgrade to V4 or higher. Some older, unsupported versions of optiPoint 410/420 HFA IP phones are also vulnerable. Please ensure, that V5 is installed on all phones. optiPoint 600 office has reached end of life since a few years already; an update is unfortunately not available References

#### CERT Addendum

Within the VxWorks Kernel programmers guide it states: âFor production systems, you will want to reconfigure VxWorks with only those components needed for deployed operation, and to build it as the appropriate type of system image. You will likely want to remove components required for host development support, such as the WDB target agent and debugging components (INCLUDE\_WDB and INCLUDE\_DEBUG), as well as to remove any other operating system components not required to support your application. Other considerations may include reducing the memory requirements of the system, speeding up boot time, and security issues.â

Some products based on VxWorks have the WDB target agent debug service enabled by default. This service provides read/write access to the device's memory and allows functions to be called.

### Description

The VxWorks WDB target agent is a target-resident, run-time facility that is required for connecting host tools to a VxWorks target system during development. WDB is a selectable component in the VxWorks configuration and is enabled by default. The WDB debug agent access is not secured and does provide a security hole in a deployed system.

It is advisable for production systems to reconfigure VxWorks with only those components needed for deployed operation and to build it as the appropriate type of system image. It is recommended to remove host development components such as the WDB target agent and debugging components (INCLUDE\_WDB and INCLUDE\_DEBUG) as well as other operating system components that are not required to support customer applications.

Consult the VxWorks Kernel Programmer's guide for more information on WDB.

Additional information can be found in ICS-CERT advisory [ICSA-10-214-01](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-214-01_VxWorks_Vulnerabilities.pdf) and on the [Metasploit Blog](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2010/08/02/shiny-old-vxworks-vulnerabilities).

### Impact

An attacker can use the debug service to fully compromise the device.

### Solution

#### Disable debug agent

Vendors should remove the WDB target debug agent in their VxWorks based products by removing the INCLUDE\_WDB & INCLUDE\_DEBUG components from their VxWorks Image.

#### Restrict access

Appropriate firewall rules should be implemented to restrict access to the debug service (17185/udp) to only trusted sources until vendors have released patches to disable it.

Security Advisory Report - OBSO-1010-01
Enabled VxWorks debug service
Creation Date: 2010-10-15
Last Update: 2010-10-15 Summary
A security researcher has identified a large number of products based on the VxWorks platform provided by Wind River Systems with a debug service enabled by default at port 17185/udp. Vulnerability Details
The debug service provides full access to the memory of an affected device and allows for memory to be written as well as functions to be called. Of the various products based on VxWorks, the following are not affected by this vulnerability: HiPath Wireless Convergence, RG 8700, optiPoint 410/420 SIP and HFA (V5). Affected Products
HiPath 3000 (HG 1500 Gateway)
HiPath 4000 (HG 35xx Gateway)
optiPoint 410/420 HFA, versions before V5
optiPoint 600 office Recommended Actions
In general, it is recommended not to attach the mentioned systems directly at the internet. Appropriate firewall rules should be implemented to restrict access to the debug service (17185/udp). The problem is solved in the following versions; an update to these or higher versions is highly recommended: HiPath 3000 V8: V8 R5.2.0
HiPath 4000 V4: V4 R4.1.12
HiPath 4000 V5: V5 R1.2.4 Please note: HiPath 3000 V7: You need to upgrade the HG 1500 gateway only. Please use V8 R5.2.0 for this. You may keep the system itself in V7. HiPath 3000 V6 and earlier have reached end of SW support; please consider an upgrade to V7 or V8
HiPath 4000 V3 and earlier have reached end of SW support; please consider an upgrade to V4 or higher. Some older, unsupported versions of optiPoint 410/420 HFA IP phones are also vulnerable. Please ensure, that V5 is installed on all phones. optiPoint 600 office has reached end of life since a few years already; an update is unfortunately not available References

#### CERT Addendum

Within the VxWorks Kernel programmers guide it states: âFor production systems, you will want to reconfigure VxWorks with only those components needed for deployed operation, and to build it as the appropriate type of system image. You will likely want to remove components required for host development support, such as the WDB target agent and debugging components (INCLUDE\_WDB and INCLUDE\_DEBUG), as well as to remove any other operating system components not required to support your application. Other considerations may include reducing the memory requirements of the system, speeding up boot time, and security issues.â
