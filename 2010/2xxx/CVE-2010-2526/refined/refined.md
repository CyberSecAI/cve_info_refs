{
  "CVE-2010-2526": {
    "Description": "The cluster logical volume manager daemon (clvmd) in LVM2 did not correctly validate credentials. A local user could use this flaw to manipulate logical volumes without root privileges and cause a denial of service in the cluster.",
    "Root cause": "An upstream commit changed the communication method between lvm and clvmd from a filesystem socket to an abstract socket, but did not implement proper security checks to authenticate client connections.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "clvmd, a privileged process, accepts, acts upon, and responds to communications from unprivileged processes.",
      "The communication channel between lvm and clvmd using an abstract socket did not enforce security mechanisms.",
      "Unprivileged processes can send commands to clvmd that should be restricted to root users."
    ],
    "Impact": "An unprivileged local attacker can send commands to clvmd to:",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access by unprivileged processes.",
      "Sending control commands to the clvmd daemon through the insecure abstract socket."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Local access to the system.",
      "Ability to send commands to clvmd's abstract socket."
    ],
     "Privilege escalation": "The ability to execute commands as root via clvmd."
    ,
      "Additional details": [
        "Instruct clvmd to suspend the use of any Logical Volume visible to any machine in the cluster with immediate effect.",
        "Instruct clvmd to activate, deactivate or reload any Logical Volume visible to any machine in the cluster.",
        "Instruct clvmd to die.",
        "Instruct clvmd to restart (versions 2.02.64 and later).",
        "Instruct clvmd to obtain, release or report the state of locks held by the daemon.",
        "Enable/disable clvmd's debugging mode which controls the amount of detail it logs.",
        "Instruct clvmd to create a backup of a Volume Group's metadata on all the other nodes.",
        "Instruct clvmd to report the cluster name.",
         "Instruct clvmd to echo back the command it received.",
        "Instruct clvmd to refresh its internal caches."
      ]
