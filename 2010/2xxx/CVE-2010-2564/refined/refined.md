Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2564:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Windows Movie Maker parses specially crafted project files (.MSWMM). Specifically, a memory corruption issue occurs during the processing of these malformed files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of project files leads to memory corruption, which can be exploited by an attacker.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Control:** An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user is logged on with administrative rights, the attacker could obtain the same level of access, potentially compromising the entire system.
- **Application Crash:** Exploiting the vulnerability could also cause the Movie Maker application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachments:** An attacker can send a malicious .MSWMM file as an email attachment, tricking the user into opening it.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious .MSWMM file or inject it into a compromised site, leading a victim to download and execute it.
- **Social Engineering:** In both scenarios, attackers need to employ social engineering to convince users to open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not require prior access to the targeted system.
- **File Creation:** The attacker needs the capability to create a malformed .MSWMM project file.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the specially crafted project file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects specific versions of Windows Movie Maker (2.1, 2.6, and 6.0) on Windows XP and Windows Vista.
- The vulnerability was privately reported.
- Microsoft's Exploitability Index rated the vulnerability as "1" at the time of disclosure, meaning "Exploitation More Likely."
- Microsoft recommends applying the provided security updates or using the provided workaround by removing the file association.
