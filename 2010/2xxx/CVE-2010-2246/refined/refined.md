Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `feh` image viewer, when used with the `--wget-timestamp` option, passes an unescaped URL directly to a `system()` call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By crafting a malicious URL containing shell metacharacters, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `system()` call.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Escaping:** The application does not sanitize or escape the URL before passing it to the `system()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running `feh`.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the user's privileges, this could lead to data theft, system modification, or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URL:** The attacker must trick a user into opening a specially crafted URL using `feh` with the `--wget-timestamp` option.
- The malicious URL must resolve to a valid file, though the content of the file doesn't seem to matter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to open the malicious URL with the vulnerable command.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have a server hosting the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

- HTTP escapes (e.g., `%20` for space) are not effective in mitigating the vulnerability.
- URL redirects do not seem to be effective for this particular exploit.
- The vulnerability is present in `feh` versions 1.7 and earlier, down to at least 1.3.4.
- The issue was fixed in `feh` version 1.8.
