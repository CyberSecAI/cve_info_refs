The second part about POSIX file capabilities was realized shortly
afterwards while thinking of possible other similar cases, and has been
fixed too now:
<http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=4d172a194addc49851e558ea390d3045894e3230>

To my knowledge no distro actually uses the file capability support in RPM
though.

I'm going to give both of these the same CVE id. The issues are very
related, and I had look at the CWE guide, they both seem to fall under
"CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions"

Steve, feel free to overrule me on this one.

CVE-2010-2059

At a low level of granularity, it can be overkill to distinguish between
closely-related flaw types.

The factor of concern here is that Red Hat bug 598775 suggests that the
first variant was committed to a changeset, but not the second.  I can't
(quickly) assess whether upstream committed changes for both variants, but
if there's only a commit for the first one (and a public release), then
maybe we consider these bugs as "almost-but-not-quite the same version"
and assign a separate CVE.

We also use time lag between disclosures as a splitter, but these were
more-or-less within a 24-hour period, which we typically treat as "same
day."

This is fuzzy on both vuln type and version... I defer to others who can
shed more insight on the question of whether these versions are different
enough.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Maybe obvious and natural conclusion from previous post already, but Panu clarified
yet, similar deficiency holds for dealing with posix file capabilities and SELinux
contexts, i.e. they are not cleared after pkg upgrade. Not sure second CVE is needed
for this, but if one is enough, wanted to explicitly mention this, so it can be
described in the text of the CVE too.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Thus, if a user made a hard link to the old executable, he/she will still be able to run it with elevated privileges.  This is bad if it was replaced because it had a vulnerability.  The problem seems to occur only when executables are replaced, not when they are erased.  This is the same bug that was previously noted in dpkg: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=225692>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): rpm-4.8.0-14.fc13.x86_64  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Rebuild the attached SRPM twice, once with -D 'rel 1' and once with -D 'rel 2'. 2. mkdir /tmp/rpm-setuid-test 3. rpm -i rpm-setuid-test-0-1.fc13.$(rpm -E '%{_build_arch}').rpm 4. ln /usr/bin/rpm-setuid-test /tmp/rpm-setuid-test/ 5. rpm -U rpm-setuid-test-0-2.fc13.$(rpm -E '%{_build_arch}').rpm 6. ls -l /tmp/rpm-setuid-test/rpm-setuid-test  Actual results: The old executable is setuid.  Expected results: The old executable is not setuid.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c1)  Panu Matilainen    2010-06-02 05:04:52 UTC  ``` Ah, good catch.

Though the >     file capability support is NOT used in these rpm >     versions yet.      A slight correction/clarification: rpm in Fedora >= 11 comes with file capability packaging support enabled, but to my knowledge this feature is not /used/ by any packages in any distribution (Fedora or otherwise) yet.   Another twist is that the file capability support is a compile-time optional feature, and rpm will only be able to drop capabilities from hardlinks IFF capability support is enabled in rpm itself by --with-cap option to configure. Thus it's recommended that rpm is always built with --with-cap option on distributions with filesystem level support for POSIX file capabilities to enable rpm to drop capabilities potentially set by administrators/package scriptlets.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c17)  Michael Schröder    2010-06-04 09:42:12 UTC  ``` #14: Yes, all suse versions with have rpm >= 4.4.2.3 are vulnerable, too.

You reported the issue with a complete patch in bugzilla, at that point a wrong patch ending up in the rpm.org tree (years after the fact) is hardly your fault either.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c21)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-08 22:49:06 UTC  ``` See [bug #601955](show_bug.cgi?id=601955 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2198 rpm: fails to drop POSIX file capabilities on package upgrade or removal") for [CVE-2010-2198](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2198) (rpm: fails to drop POSIX file capabilities/SELinux context information on package upgrade or removal)  See [bug #601956](show_bug.cgi?id=601956 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2010-2199 rpm: fails to drop POSIX ACLs on package upgrade or removal") for [CVE-2010-2199](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2199) (rpm: fails to drop POSIX ACLs on package upgrade or removal)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c22)  Panu Matilainen    2010-06-09 09:10:25 UTC  ``` Err, this is getting rather mixed up.  The issues at hand are 1) RPM fails to drop SUID/SGID bits on package upgrade (and removal for rpm < 4.4.2.1) 2) RPM fails to drop POSIX file capabilities on package upgrade and removal, which is simply the more fine-grained analogue of case 1). This only affects systems with filesystem-level support for POSIX file capabilities.  IMO there's little point having separate CVE's for the cases but if we must ... at least lets get the descriptions straight. POSIX ACL's and SELinux contexts aren't involved as they dont have additional means to gain extra privileges through execution AFAICT.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c23)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-11 11:41:59 UTC  ``` rpm-4.8.1-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/rpm-4.8.1-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c24)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-11 12:35:17 UTC  ``` rpm-4.8.1-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/rpm-4.8.1-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c25)  Matt McCutchen    2010-06-11 20:11:26 UTC  ``` I realized that hard links are not the only way to retain access to an old executable.

Mm... open() requires read (or write, duh) permission on the file, which no program with SUID/SGID bits enabled should have. Sure the link count test could be removed, it's there only to avoid unnecessary work in the common case. This just raises the question: how far should rpm go babysitting packagers/admins? Disallow creating packages with SUID/SGID on readable/writable files? If an admin changes permissions of an executable to something "vulnerable", is it rpm's job to try and mop it under the carpet?   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c29)  Matt McCutchen    2010-06-14 12:45:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c28)) > (In reply to [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c25)) > > I realized that hard links are not the only way to retain access to an old > > executable.

Clearing the set[ug]id bits is conditioned on the executable being set[ug]id in the first place, which is not the common case, so the unnecessary work there should be minimal.
