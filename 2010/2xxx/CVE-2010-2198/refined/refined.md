Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-2198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) failing to properly remove POSIX file capabilities during package upgrades. This issue occurs because RPM does not clear the file capabilities of the old file when replacing it with a new one during an upgrade.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Preservation of Permissions (CWE-281):** RPM does not remove POSIX file capabilities from old files during package upgrades, leaving them with potentially dangerous privileges.
- **Inconsistency in Handling File Attributes:** RPM handles file attributes differently during package removals compared to package upgrades, leading to the vulnerability during upgrades.
- **Lack of Awareness of File Capability Changes:** The vulnerability was also present in the file capability removal logic due to a change in how the file system handled file capabilities and the fact that they were not considered during file replacement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges by creating a hard link or accessing the old executable through `/proc/self/fd`, thus running the old file with capabilities it should not have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to create hard links or open and execute the old file through `/proc/self/fd`.
- **Package Upgrade:** The vulnerability is triggered when a package is upgraded and replaces an existing executable.
- **Hard Links:** Attackers could create hard links to the old executable prior to the upgrade, retaining the SUID/SGID bits or POSIX file capabilities.
- **File Descriptor:** Attackers could also open the executable, and then exec it through /proc/self/fd.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to create files and links within the system.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to be aware of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.
- **Privileged User Package Upgrade:** The vulnerability is triggered when a privileged user performs a package upgrade.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially discovered with SUID/SGID bits not being cleared during upgrades. The same vulnerability was found to be present for POSIX file capabilities.
- The vulnerability is related to CVE-2010-2059, which focused on SUID/SGID bits, and CVE-2005-4889, which relates to package removals.
- The fix involves ensuring that RPM properly clears the SUID/SGID bits and file capabilities from old files during package upgrades.
- The fix was applied to various versions of RPM in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora.

The content indicates that the vulnerability was addressed through patches applied to the RPM package.
