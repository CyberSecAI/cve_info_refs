{
  "cveId": "CVE-2010-2960",
  "rootCause": "The `keyctl_session_to_parent()` function in the Linux kernel does not properly check if a parent session keyring exists before accessing its UID, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Null pointer dereference",
    "Missing check for parent session keyring",
    "Race condition due to missing RCU lock"
  ],
  "impact": "A local attacker can crash the system (denial of service) by triggering a null pointer dereference in the `keyctl_session_to_parent()` function, or potentially gain root privileges.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "Local access",
	"Exploiting the keyctl system call"
  ],
  "requiredCapabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to execute code on the system.",
  "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability occurs because the code assumes the existence of a parent session keyring without checking. This is particularly problematic if `pam_keyinit` hasn't been invoked during the login procedure. The initial patch addresses a missing RCU lock but doesn't fully resolve the issue. The complete fix involves making the UID check conditional on the existence of a parent session keyring. The vulnerability was introduced in upstream commit `ee18d64c` (v2.6.32-rc1)."
