  "CVE-2010-2160": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious web page. The specific vulnerability exists within the parsing of an undocumented opcode within Adobe's ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 bytecode. The operand to this opcode is used as an offset to a structure and if set to a malicious value can be pointed to attacker controlled data. The structure contains a function pointer that is later called. If an attacker modifies the controlled data pointed to by the invalid offset, this function pointer can be set to point to malicious code thus gaining execution under the context of the user running the browser.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in how an undocumented opcode within Adobe's ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 bytecode is parsed. A maliciously crafted offset can point to attacker-controlled data containing a function pointer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of undocumented opcodes",
      "Use of attacker-controlled offset to access data",
      "Indirect code execution through function pointer manipulation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the browser.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page containing specially crafted SWF content"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create and host a malicious SWF file. Ability to entice a user to visit a malicious webpage."
