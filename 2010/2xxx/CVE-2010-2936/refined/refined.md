Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-2936:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

*   The content from lists.opensuse.org, ubuntu.com, www.openwall.com, www.gentoo.org, www.debian.org,  and bugzilla.redhat.com, and www.openoffice.org explicitly mention `CVE-2010-2936`, indicating relevance. Specifically, the SUSE Security Summary Report, Ubuntu Security Notice, Red Hat bugzilla entries, and OpenOffice.org security bulletin directly reference and describe the issue related to this CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Short Integer Overflow:** A short integer overflow occurs during the processing of certain PowerPoint (.ppt) documents, specifically when handling polygons that are too large. This overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Integer Truncation Error:** An integer truncation error can also lead to a heap-based buffer overflow while parsing dictionary property items of the input .ppt file.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The core vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, arising from the integer overflow or truncation during processing of PPT files.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The application fails to adequately validate the size or properties of elements within the PPT files, leading to the exploitable condition.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most significant impact is the potential for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org.
*   **Application Crash (Denial of Service):** If exploitation is not fully successful, it can at least lead to a crash of the OpenOffice.org application, resulting in denial of service.
*   **System Compromise:** Due to code execution, an attacker can potentially achieve full system compromise.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted PPT files:** The attack vector is through maliciously crafted Microsoft PowerPoint documents.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens such a crafted .ppt file using OpenOffice.org.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can be remote, needing only to provide the crafted .ppt file to the victim.
*   **User Interaction (Victim Required):** Requires the user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable version of OpenOffice.org.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources confirm this vulnerability affects various versions of OpenOffice.org, including versions 2 and 3 prior to 3.3.
*   The vulnerability is specifically linked to the Impress component of OpenOffice.org.
*   Some content mentions that modern glibc protection mechanisms may mitigate the vulnerability to some extent by causing an application abort instead of arbitrary code execution. However, this should be treated as a possible mitigation, not a resolution of the underlying issue.
*   The Debian security advisory explicitly states that this issue can be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
*   The Ubuntu notice clarifies that Ubuntu 10.10 was not affected by the specific heap overflow caused by the malformed PPT files.
*   The fix for the issue includes updates to `openoffice.org-impress`, `openoffice.org-writer` and `openoffice.org-core` packages in various Linux distributions.

In Summary, CVE-2010-2936 describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in OpenOffice.org's Impress component, caused by insufficient validation of PPT files. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, whereas, failed exploitation can result in a DoS. The primary attack vector is through specially crafted PPT files delivered to a target user.
