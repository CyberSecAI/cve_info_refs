Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the URL when constructing error pages in the Rekonq browser and QtDemoBrowser. Specifically, when a requested URL fails to load, the browser includes the full URL, including any embedded HTML/JavaScript, directly into the error message. This allows for the injection of malicious content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS):** The primary vulnerability is a UXSS flaw.  The browser renders the full, unsanitized URL in the error page, which allows injected JavaScript to execute.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `reply->url().toString()` method is used directly without proper sanitization or escaping before being included in the HTML of the error page. This allows for arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to be injected.
*   **Cookie Access:** When a crafted URL for a domain using wildcard cookies is loaded, the injected JavaScript can access those cookies because the error page is rendered in the context of the requested (but failed) URL.
*   **Crash:** In older versions, loading a crafted URL in a fresh instance of the browser could cause a crash. This crash seems to have been resolved in later versions, but the XSS and cookie stealing issues remained.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the browser, potentially leading to a wide range of attacks.
*   **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can steal cookies set by websites, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts. Specifically, if a site uses wildcard cookies, the malicious JavaScript in the error page can access those cookies.
*   **Page Spoofing:** The attacker could spoof legitimate-looking content on the error page.
*  **Denial of Service (older versions):** In early versions a crash could occur when loading a crafted URL in a fresh instance of the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URLs:** Attackers can create URLs that include HTML and JavaScript code, which are then injected into the browser's error page. These URLs are designed to not resolve, triggering the error condition.
*   **Error Pages:** The vulnerability is present specifically in the way the browser handles error pages when a requested URL cannot be loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** An attacker needs the ability to create and distribute malicious URLs.
*   **Target User Action:** The target user needs to attempt to load the crafted URL within the vulnerable browser.
*   **Target Site Wildcard Cookies:** Cookie theft requires the targeted site to set wildcard domain cookies.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was initially reported against Rekonq 0.4 and later found to affect Qt's demo browser, specifically in `demos/browser/webview.cpp`.
*   The vulnerable code snippets are located in `rekonq-mainline/src/webpage.cpp` where the URL is directly used when constructing the error message without sanitization, and in `webview.cpp` of Qt's demo browser.
*   The fix involves removing the path from the URL displayed on the error page, and properly escaping the URL with `Qt::escape`.
*   The initial bug report included a crash on fresh instances of the browser which was later fixed, while the XSS vector remained.
