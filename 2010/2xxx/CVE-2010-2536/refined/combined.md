| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=217464#c0)  Tim Brown    2009-12-05 17:52:42 UTC  ``` Version:           0.2.90 (using 4.3.2 (KDE 4.3.2), Debian packages) Compiler:          cc OS:                Linux (x86_64) release 2.6.31-1-amd64  Rekonq is affected by a universal XSS and / or crash.  Opening a fresh instance of Rekonq and entering the following URL causes a crash:  <http://thisdomainwillnotresolveandrekonqerrorpagewillbeshownwithfullurlembedded.twitter.com/>"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>  However, if you enter this into a new tab on an existing instance of Rekonq then it will first try and resolve the hostname and then when that fails it will display an error message.  The error message output by Rekonq includes the full URL, including the <script> tags.  Since Rekonq see that the requested URL is part of *.twitter.com and since twitter.com sets wildcard domain'd cookies, the error page will be able to access any cookies that have been set.  Note that this is not unique to twitter.com, cookies can be stole for any site that sets wildcard domain'd cookies.  There are therefore 3 issues:  1) Crash on fresh instance 2) Injection of malicious content into error message 3) Access to cookies when the hostname under which the cookies have been set was not accessible  I believe the root cause of 2 is:  rekonq-mainline/src/webpage.cpp:    msg += "<h2>" + i18nc("%1=an URL, e.g.'kde.org'", "When connecting to: %1", reply->url().toString()) + "</h2>";  Note that there is no sanitisation of reply->url().toString()!  I haven't investigated the others in any depth but I will update the bug with a stack trace for 1 shortly. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=217464#c1)  Tim Brown    2009-12-05 17:58:37 UTC  ``` Application: rekonq (rekonq), signal: Segmentation fault [Current thread is 1 (Thread 0x7f2b122b6750 (LWP 3613))]  Thread 3 (Thread 0x7f2af75e1910 (LWP 3614)): #0  pthread_cond_wait@@GLIBC_2.3.2 () at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/pthread_cond_wait.S:261 #1  0x00007f2b0ec29499 in QWaitCondition::wait(QMutex*, unsigned long) () from /usr/lib/libQtCore.so.4 #2  0x00007f2b113e54ce in ??

I've seen the changes but I don't know Qt well enough to give you a guaranteed answer without checking.  Unfortunately, Qt in Debian hasn't quite caught up with where Rekonq is at, so for now I can't build it :(.  I have also found further cases of XSS.  When you open a new tab you get a tool bar with favourites, bookmarks, closed tabs and history.  These "about:" views are rendered using webkit's HTML rendering engine and can therefore be used to execute injected Javascript.  For example any HTML including script tags in the title of the page, or the URL will be rendered.  Luckily document.domain for these is not set, so the associated risk is less severe, but still. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=217464#c10)  Andrea Diamantini    2010-04-13 12:09:37 UTC  ``` Seems fixed now. rekonq 0.4.60 kde 4.4 compiled from branches qtwebkit 2.0 ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=217464#c11)  Tim Brown    2010-07-14 18:02:45 UTC  ``` Still a problem even on 0.5.

The full URL submitted is used as part of the error page for the "Try again" button.  The good news is that this time, I don't appear to have access to the cookies for the domain this time but as you can see it's still possible to spoof up legitimate loooking URLs. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=217464#c12)  Tim Brown    2010-07-21 20:20:57 UTC  ``` As discussed in #rekonq, a CVE has been requested and assigned: CVE-2010-2536 ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=217464#c13)  Eelko Berkenpies    2010-07-23 16:27:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 49437](attachment.cgi?id=49437 "Removes path from URL on error page") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=49437&action=edit "Removes path from URL on error page") Removes path from URL on error page  The attached (simple) patch produces a more firefox-like error page and removes the path from the URL, preventing any (XSS) code into being included into the error page.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi guys,

Can a CVE be assigned for the universal XSS in Rekonq
(<https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217464>).  Essentially, the error page
displayed when a requested URL is not available includes said URL.  If said
URL includes HTML fragments these will be rendered in the context of the
requested URL.  If you request something like
<http://wontresolve.twitter.com/>"><script>alert(document.cookies)</script> then
you may very well snare your Twitter cookies.

Originally when I reported this bug to the Rekonq developers, it was a very
small project without much following, however Rekonq is starting to make its
way into multiple distros so I thought it was probably time to flag it up.

Quick history:
05/12/09 Reported by me against Rekonq 0.4
05/12/09 Added note that it also appears to affect Qt's demo browser
05/12/09 KDE patch kwebkitpart
07/12/09 Confirmed by Rekonq developers
13/04/10 Reported resolved by developers
14/07/10 Retested on 0.5 and found still to be vulnerable

Cheers,
Tim
