Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager (rhev-m) did not correctly pass the `postzero` parameter when merging snapshots, specifically for deleted volumes. The `postzero` parameter is supposed to ensure that data from deleted volumes is securely overwritten with zeros.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deletion:** The vulnerability stems from an insecure deletion process. When a virtual machine's volume is deleted (specifically after a snapshot merge), the underlying storage was not being properly zeroed out due to the missing `postzero` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A guest user in a newly created virtual machine (VM) could potentially read data from previously deleted VMs located in the same data domain. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information that was intended to be removed.
- The impact is limited in scope as it requires the specific conditions of a new VM being created in a data domain that had previous VM deletions which weren't properly wiped.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious guest user within a VM.
- They could read data from the underlying storage of deleted VMs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a user of a newly created virtual machine.
- They must be on a system where previously deleted VMs were stored in the same data domain.
- They require some level of access to read the underlying storage from deleted VMs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager (rhev-m).
- The bug report mentions that the issue was resolved in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 2.2, via RHSA-2010:0478.
- The "postzero" parameter was the missing component of secure deletion and not being correctly passed by rhev-m during the snapshot merge process for deleted volumes.
