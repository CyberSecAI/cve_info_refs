Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Joomla! Component "simpledownload" version 0.9.5 (and possibly earlier) is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). This is due to the component's failure to properly sanitize user input when handling the `controller` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. The `controller` parameter in the `index.php` request is directly used to include files without sufficient sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read any file on the server that the web server user has access to. This could include sensitive system files, configuration files, database connection details, or other application source code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Access to these files could lead to sensitive information disclosure, which could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request. The attacker manipulates the `controller` parameter to specify the path to a file they want to include.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! site.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to be aware that the "simpledownload" component is installed and is vulnerable.
*   **Basic understanding of path traversal:** The attacker needs to understand how to use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`) to navigate the file system and access desired files.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable URL is in the format `http://127.0.0.1//index.php?option=com_simpledownload&controller=[LFI BY ARUMBIA]`
*   The exploit example given is `http://127.0.0.1//index.php?option=com_simpledownload&controller=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` which attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file on a Linux system. The `%00` null byte is used to attempt to truncate the file path, but this is often ignored by modern PHP versions.
