Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2010-2562:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files. Specifically, a memory corruption vulnerability exists in how Excel handles these files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption in Microsoft Office Excel due to improper parsing of Excel files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain complete control of the affected system.
- Ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user, so users with administrative privileges are at greater risk.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Excel file as an email attachment and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious Excel file. They would need to convince users to visit the site and then open the file. Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content can also be used to host the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted Excel file that triggers the vulnerability.
- Ability to deliver the file to the target user, either through email or a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file.

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   Users with fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
*   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail.

**Workarounds:**

*   Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations.
*   Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources.
*   Do not open Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources.
