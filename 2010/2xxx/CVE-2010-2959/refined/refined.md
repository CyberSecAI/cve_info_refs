{
  "CVE-2010-2959": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in net/can/bcm.c in the Controller Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (system crash) via crafted CAN traffic.",
    "affected_products": [
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time 11 SP1",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 11 SP1",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP1",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1",
      "openSUSE 11.3",
      "Debian Linux 2.6.26"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the number of frames (nframes) within the CAN bus protocol module (can_bcm), specifically during the setup of transmit (TX_SETUP) and receive (RX_SETUP) operations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow",
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Improper memory allocation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote denial of service or local privilege escalation leading to arbitrary code execution or system crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted CAN traffic"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local users or remote attackers capable of sending/receiving CAN traffic.",
        "notes": "The number of frames in TX_SETUP and RX_SETUP were derived from a single byte multiplex value. The issue can be mitigated by blacklisting the can/can_bcm modules"
    },
    "affected_systems": [
      "Systems using vulnerable Linux kernel versions with the CAN bus protocol module (can_bcm) enabled"
