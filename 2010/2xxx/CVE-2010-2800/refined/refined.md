{
  "CVE-2010-2800": {
    "Root cause": "The MS-ZIP and Quantum decoders in cabextract did not handle the case where read() provides zero bytes correctly, leading to an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of zero-byte input in MS-ZIP and Quantum decoders",
        "Missing 'inject two fake bytes' logic present in LZX decoder"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (infinite loop).",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted .cab files containing malformed MSZIP or Quantum archives.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a specially crafted .cab file to the victim to be processed by cabextract"
  }
