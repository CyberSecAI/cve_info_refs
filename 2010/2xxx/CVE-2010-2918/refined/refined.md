Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the Joomla! component "Visites" version 1.1 RC2. This means that the application is including a remote file in its processing without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `myMailer.class.php` file within the component directly includes a file specified by the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter. This parameter is not validated, allowing an attacker to specify a URL to a malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Joomla! installation.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain full control of the server, including access to sensitive data, modification of website content, and the ability to use the server to launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable file, `myMailer.class.php`, with the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter set to a malicious URL.
- **Web Browser:** An attacker could craft a malicious link or embed the exploit in a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! installation.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker must know that the Visites component is installed and vulnerable.
- **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server accessible to the vulnerable Joomla! server.
