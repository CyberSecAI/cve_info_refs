{
  "CVE-2010-2067": {
    "Description": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in LibTIFF when processing the SubjectDistance EXIF tag. This can be triggered by a specially crafted TIFF image, leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient bounds checking when copying data into a stack-allocated buffer while processing the SubjectDistance EXIF tag.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient bounds checking"
     ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application that processes the malformed TIFF file, or a denial of service via application crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed TIFF image file with a specially crafted SubjectDistance EXIF tag.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted TIFF file to the vulnerable application, either through local file access, a network service, or by tricking the user into opening the file."
