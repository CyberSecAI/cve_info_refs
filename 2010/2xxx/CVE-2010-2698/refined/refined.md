Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2698:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the Sijio Community Software, specifically in the gallery component and blog section.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `gallery/?parent` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The blog section allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript, which is then persistently stored and executed when other users view the blog.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete database information, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or complete compromise of the application.
    *  **Persistent XSS:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks on users visiting the affected blog pages.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through the `parent` parameter in the gallery URL: `http://server/gallery/?parent=[SQLi]`
    *   **Persistent XSS:** The attack vector involves registering an account, posting a blog with malicious javascript code, such as: `"><marquee><h1>XSS3d By Sid3^effects</h1><marquee>`, which gets stored in the database and executed when the blog post is viewed by other users. The attacker would typically post the blog through a URL such as `http://server/my_blogs/` and then the affected page, where the XSS payload is executed, would be something like `http://www.axlex.com/blogs/`
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SQL query and send it to the vulnerable application. This typically requires network access to the server.
   *  **Persistent XSS:** An attacker needs to have the ability to create an account and post to the blog section of the affected application.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit-db entry provides detailed attack vectors, example URLs and payloads.
* The exploit-db entry also mentions additional CVEs (CVE-2010-2697 and CVE-2010-2696) potentially affecting the same software, however, the details of those are not included in the text provided.

**Summary:**

This content identifies a web application vulnerability in Sijio Community Software. It details both a SQL injection vulnerability in the gallery component and a persistent XSS vulnerability in the blog feature. The exploit-db provides more specific attack vectors and payload examples than the general CVE description would provide.
