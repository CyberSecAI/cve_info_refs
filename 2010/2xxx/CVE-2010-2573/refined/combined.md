**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**I have Microsoft PowerPoint 2007, which is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin. Why am I being offered this update?**

Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin; however, the vulnerable Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007 is delivered with Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 and will be offered this security update.

**What is Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer?**

Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer, which is based on Microsoft Office 2010 technology, is a replacement for Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007. Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer lets you view full-featured presentations created in Microsoft PowerPoint 97 and later versions. Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

**I use the "Package a Presentation for CD" feature. How can I help ensure my presentations are protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin?**

After applying this security update to affected software, customers running supported editions of Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 can issue updated versions of their presentations created using the [Package a Presentation for CD](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/828504) feature in PowerPoint to help ensure that the PowerPoint Viewer included in their presentations is protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 presentations created using the Package a Presentation for CD feature do not include the PowerPoint Viewer.

**How are Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?**

A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft PowerPoint is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft PowerPoint that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.

**The Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle.

## PowerPoint Parsing Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2572

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft PowerPoint handles specially crafted PowerPoint 95 files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-2572](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2572).

#### Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint Parsing Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2572

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.
* By default, the opening of PowerPoint 95 files is blocked in Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3. For more information about file types that are blocked after installing Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 938810](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/938810/).

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  **For Office 2003**

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  ```
  ```
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  ```
  ```
  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

  ```

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.

  Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, [Plan file block settings for Office 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179230.aspx).

For Microsoft Office 2007, Office 2003 or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  For Office 2003

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  ```
  ```
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  ```
  ```
  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000

  ```
* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.

  To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en).

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx) to install all recommended updates.

  **Enable MOICE**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.

| Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler |
| --- |
| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document |
| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet\ ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template\ ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin |
| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show\ ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow |

**Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

**How to undo the workaround.** Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.

| Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- |
| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8 |
| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8\ ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template\ ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |
| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow\ ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8 |

**Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

* **Do not open PowerPoint files from untrusted sources**

  Do not open or save PowerPoint files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for PowerPoint Parsing Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2572

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists because of the way that Microsoft PowerPoint parses the PowerPoint file format when opening a specially crafted PowerPoint 95 file.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted PowerPoint 95 file with an affected version of Microsoft PowerPoint.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted PowerPoint file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a PowerPoint file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.

**Why is this vulnerability rated Moderate for Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3?**

By default, the opening of PowerPoint 95 files is blocked in Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3. This mitigating factor lowers the severity rating of the vulnerability to Moderate.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft PowerPoint is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way that Microsoft PowerPoint parses specially crafted PowerPoint files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint Integer Underflow Causes Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2573

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.

#### Workarounds for PowerPoint Integer Underflow Causes Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2573

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  **For Office 2003**

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  ```
  ```
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  ```
  ```
  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

  ```

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.

  Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, [Plan file block settings for Office 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179230.aspx).

  **Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special "exempt directory" as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2007, Office 2003 or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  For Office 2003

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  ```
  ```
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  ```
  ```
  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000

  ```
* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.

  To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en).

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx) to install all recommended updates.

  **Enable MOICE**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.

| Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler |
| --- |
| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document |
| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet\ ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template\ ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin |
| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show\ ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow |

**Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

**How to undo the workaround.** Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.

| Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- |
| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8 |
| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8\ ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template\ ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |
| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow\ ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8 |

**Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

* **Do not open PowerPoint files from untrusted sources**

  Do not open or save PowerPoint files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
