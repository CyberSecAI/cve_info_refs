How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Search result of b.m.o. does not escape "--------- =\_aaaaaaaaaa0": it is used as boudary of multipart/x-mixed-replace.
Attackers can inject boundary of multipart/x-mixed-replace.
It may be able to be used for HTTP Header injection.
Example:
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc=---------%20%3D_aaaaaaaaaa0&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&resolution=---&resolution=DUPLICATE>

I think, there are two solutions.
1. Change boudary text to be random.
2. If search result contains boundary text, replace it to HTML character reference.

This is really a bug with upstream CGI module... The default boundary is hardcoded when it should be randomized.
sub multipart\_init {
my($self,@p) = self\_or\_default(@\_);
my($boundary,@other) = rearrange\_header([BOUNDARY],@p);
$boundary = $boundary || '------- =\_aaaaaaaaaa0';
$self->{'separator'} = "$CRLF--$boundary$CRLF";
$self->{'final\_separator'} = "$CRLF--$boundary--$CRLF";
$type = SERVER\_PUSH($boundary);
return $self->header(
-nph => 0,
-type => $type,
(map { split "=", $\_, 2 } @other),
) . "WARNING: YOUR BROWSER DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS SERVER-PUSH TECHNOLOGY." . $self->multipart\_end;
}Severity: normal → majorVersion: unspecified → 3.6.2

Well played, sir! Excellent bug-finding skills.
The fix looks fine to me, although someone might claim there is a slightly more performant way to do it. But this code only runs once per request, so clarity probably wins. You might want to add a comment about why you are doing it.

Did you let them know we already have a CVE number assigned for it? I assume the number can be given to them at this point since it's actually they're bug and we're working around it. Or does the fact that we were already overriding that subroutine make ours a separate issue?

Using our generate\_random\_password() routine is not upward-portable back to the upstream CGI module, however, since they don't have that routine.

The CVE for this bug is solely for the Bugzilla-specific fix, as it's not actually patching the bug within CGI.pm but in our override function. However, if the CGI.pm maintainers need a CVE to be assigned for them, that can be easily arranged.

CGI::Simple seems to have same problem.

FYI:
It might be better to write documentation that describes why randomization is needed.
I cannot find any documentation that describes "why boundary is needed to randomized on dynamic contents that uses multipart/x-mixed-replace".
Almost of documentations and example uses non-random boundary.
for example: <http://perldoc.perl.org/CGI.html#Server-Push>
I can find only two documents that suggests randomization of boundary in example. But both of them does not describe why randomize is needed.
(1)Original Documentation of Netscape uses "--ThisRandomText".
<http://web.archive.org/web/20060424004246/wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html>
(2)O'Reilly Koala book (HTML: The Definitive Guide) uses "--SomeRandomText".
(Latest edition is renamed to "HTML & XHTML : The Definitive Guide")

This page explains how x-mixed-replace is designed to be used. It's also makes it clear how a known boundary could
<http://www.abiglime.com/webmaster/articles/cgi/032498.htm>
It's not clear to me what an attacker would gain by using the known boundary. They already have the ability to send content. x-mixed-replace with a known boundary allows them to send two copies of the content and have the second replace the first.
Perhaps the issue is a case in which the first copy of the content is "good" content from a victim, but an attacker manages to craft a URL so that the good content is replaced with second piece of content which is malicious?
Having a clearer picture of how an exploit might would be helpful.

it's a variation on 'http response splitting', which can be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks, cross-user defacement, web cache poisoning, and similar exploits.

I think there are two patterns of attack for this bug.
1. set "--------- =\_aaaaaaaaaa0" to query parameter. (for example, [comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=600464#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - [SECURITY] Content/Header injection due to non-random multipart/x-mixed-replace boundary"))
2. set "--------- =\_aaaaaaaaaa0" to description of bug.
I did not test, because it is too dangerous to test at here. It may fail.

At bugzilla, CRLF in Summary of bug is not allowed, and CRLF will be converted to SPACE.
As a result of this convert, What attackers can do with bug description (Summary) seems to be only "breaking response".

I fixed it. Thanks for catching that! (I saw this encoding problem in the security advisory, but I thought this was a problem with Bugzilla itself when displaying the advisory.)

CGI.pm is used by the Bugzilla code base. However, Bugzilla may not
always be vulnerable to issues in CGI.pm depending on they use it.

Yes, it is. However, later testing found that the issue wasn't
completely fixed in 3.50. A new patch has been developed, and is
currently pending review and acceptance by the primary CGI.pm author,
Lincoln Stein. (Now CC'ed).

Note that CGI::Simple also shares the header newline injection issue
with CGI.pm, but remains unpatched. I submitted a patch, but it has not
been applied, as seen in the Network view:

<https://github.com/markstos/CGI--Simple/network>

However, even the patch I submitted is not fully complete, as it mirrors
the 3.50 state of CGI.pm, and thus also needs further work. Once CGI.pm
has a final update to address the remaining header injection issue, I'll
share the same patch with CGI::Simple.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, and and 4.0rc1 Security Advisory

Monday, Jan 24th, 2011
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A weakness in Bugzilla could allow a user to gain unauthorized access
  to another Bugzilla account.

* A weakness in the Perl CGI.pm module allows injecting HTTP headers
  and content to users via several pages in Bugzilla.

* The new user autocomplete functionality in Bugzilla 4.0 is vulnerable
  to a cross-site scripting attack.

* The new automatic duplicate detection functionality in Bugzilla 4.0
  is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

* If you put a harmful "javascript:" or "data:" URL into Bugzilla's
  "URL" field, then there are multiple situations in which Bugzilla
  will unintentionally make that link clickable.

* Various pages lack protection against cross-site request forgeries.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Account Compromise
Affected:    2.14 to 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
             any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
             enough that the attack is highly effective). This is a
             critical vulnerability that should be patched immediately
             by all Bugzilla installations.

             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619594
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4568

Class:       HTTP Response Splitting
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was
             possible to inject both headers and content to any
             browser.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2761, CVE-2010-4411, CVE-2010-4572

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new client-side
             autocomplete mechanism for all fields where a username
             is entered. This mechanism was vulnerable to a cross-site
             scripting attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619637
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4569

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new mechanism on the
             bug entry page for automatically detecting if the bug
             you are filing is a duplicate of another existing bug.
             This mechanism was vulnerable to a cross-site scripting
             attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619648
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4570

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla has a "URL" field that can contain several types
             of URL, including "javascript:" and "data:" URLs. However,
             it does not make "javascript:" and "data:" URLs into
             clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
             attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
             protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
             Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, "javascript:" and
             "data:" links were *always- summary: |-
             shown as clickable to
             logged-out users.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4567, CVE-2011-0048

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
             Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
             as previous CSRF vulnerabilities. Some of these issues
             were only addressed on more recent branches of Bugzilla
             and not fixed in earlier branches, in order to avoid
             changing behavior that external applications may depend
             on. The links below in "References" describe which issues
             were fixed on which branches.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

Subject: CVE Request -- perl-CGI two ids, perl-CGI-Simple one id (CVE-2010-3172
 already assigned for Bugzilla part)

Hi Steve, vendors,

    Masahiro Yamada reported:
    [1] <https://github.com/digg/stream/issues#issue/1>
    [2] <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=600464>

    the following deficiency (from [2]):
    Search result of b.m.o. does not escape "--------- =_aaaaaaaaaa0": it is used
    as boudary of multipart/x-mixed-replace.

    Attackers can inject boundary of multipart/x-mixed-replace.
    It may be able to be used for HTTP Header injection.

    It has been fixed in new perl-CGI v3.50 upstream version via the following commit:
    [3] <http://www2.rbfh.de/cgi/cgit.cgi/perl5.git/commit/?id=84601d63a7e34958da47dad1e61e27cb3bd467d1>

    The Changelog from [3] mentions:
    [SECURITY]
     1. The MIME boundary in multipart_init is now random
        Thanks to Byron Jones, Masahiro Yamada, Reed Loden, and Mark Stosberg

     Since perl-CGi is different code base than Bugzilla, we suspect a new CVE id is required
     for this issue? Steve, could you please allocate one? (id #1)

     2. Further improvements to handling of newlines embedded in header values.
        An exception is thrown if header values contain invalid newlines.
        Thanks to Michal Zalewski, Max Kanat-Alexander, Yanick Champoux
        Lincoln Stein, Frederic Buclin and Mark Stosberg

        Chris, Mark, could you please provide more details about the issue? Is it
        related to CVE-2010-3172?

        Steve, could you please allocate CVE id for this? (id #2)

   Yet, back to CVE-2010-3172, Masahiro mentions in [2], that perl-CGI-Simple is prone
   to same deficiency, as CVE-2010-3172 in Bugzilla was:
   [4] <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=600464#c13>

   Looks, like it was already fixed in perl-CGI-Simple too:
   [5] <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=600464#c31>

   Relevant perl-CGi-Simple patch:
   [6] <https://github.com/AndyA/CGI--Simple/commit/e4942b871a26c1317a175a91ebb7262eea59b380>

   Steve, could you allocate new CVE id for this issue? (id #3)

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Found in chart.cgi:
print "Location: query.cgi?format=" . $cgi->param('query\_format') .
($params ? "&$params" : "") . "\n\n";
print "Location: buglist.cgi" . ($params ? "?$params" : "") . "\n\n";
We should use $cgi->redirect instead.

This should work, but should I be using |-uri => correct\_urlbase() . "blah.cgi"| instead, or is this fine? We seem to vary on usage one way or another throughout the codebase.

<http://search.cpan.org/~lds/CGI.pm-3.50/lib/CGI.pm#GENERATING_A_REDIRECTION_HEADER> recommends to use full URL, not relative ones:
"You should always use full URLs (including the http: or ftp: part) in redirection requests. Relative URLs will not work correctly."

For now you should be using $cgi->url to generate a full URL, unless $cgi->redirect does that internally.

Hi folks,
While doing something completely unrelated, I noticed that the query\_format parameter passed to report.cgi is not properly sanitized when quoted in the "Location" header in the response.
This allows malicious headers or HTML body to be injected in order to steal cookies, poison reverse caches, etc. Proof-of-concept against bugzilla.mozilla.org (works in Firefox):
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/report.cgi?x_axis_field=1&y_axis_field=1&z_axis_field=1&query_format=report-tablebogus%0a%0dC><html><script>alert(1)</script>:%20s%0a%0a%0a%0aFOO&short\_desc\_type=jellyfish&short\_desc=jellyfish&product=1&component=1&version=1&long\_desc\_type=jellyfish&long\_desc=jellyfish&bug\_file\_loc\_type=1&bug\_file\_loc=1&bug\_status=1&resolution=1&bug\_severity=1&priority=1&rep\_platform=1&op\_sys=1&emailassigned\_to1=on&emailreporter1=on&emailcc1=on&emaillongdesc1=on&emailtype1=skipfish@example.com&email1=skipfish@example.com&emailassigned\_to2=on&emailreporter2=on&emailcc2=on&emaillongdesc2=on&emailtype2=skipfish@example.com&email2=skipfish@example.com&bugidtype=1&bug\_id=1&votes=1&chfieldfrom=1&chfieldto=Now&chfield=1&chfieldvalue=1&format=table&action=wrap&negate0=on&field0-0-0=1&type0-0-0=1&value0-0-0=1&cmd-add0-0-1=Or&cmd-add0-1-0=And&cmd-add1-0-0=Add%20another%20boolean%20chart

No idea. RedHat, KDE and Mandriva's Bugzilla are not vulnerable. Some of them correctly throw that the format is invalid, and some others say the page doesn't exist. No idea which ones run mod\_perl.

bmo returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK while all other installations I tested return HTTP/1.1 302 Found. No idea if that helps or not.

By looking at each $cgi->redirect() individually, the one in report.cgi seems to be the only vulnerable one. Some others, such as in long\_list.cgi, split the input string on commas and whitespaces, which seems to prevent this specific attack (no idea if it's possible to abuse CGI.pm without including spaces in the string). Also, QuickSearch.pm happily append the alias name to the URL, unfiltered, if the alias is found in the DB. As the alias is limited to 20 characters, I don't know how vulnerable QS is (can you write JS code with only 20 characters?), but probably it would be good to filter the alias there too.
$cgi->query\_string(), which is what $buffer gets, escapes the data, which is why buglist.cgi is not vulnerable.

You probably can't squeeze a full XSS payload in 20 chars, but you throw in a partial tag, e.g.:
12345678901234567890
<script src=//ab.pl/
can confuse the parser in a way that probably leads to one - say, by opening <style>, and then relying on a properly sanitized string displayed later to do something evil (CSS parser resyncs to the nearest } after parse errors).

Okay. We do need to figure out how to reproduce this bug reliably on a system other than bmo. Honestly, I'd think that CGI.pm should be responsible for validating that headers don't contain malicious stuff like that, so this shouldn't be possible.

I tested this against a system with mod\_perl, and looks like you can still inject at least one HTTP header (e.g. "Refresh" to javascript: URL, which will work in some browsers), multiple headers if you use %0D instead of %0A (works in MSIE and Chrome). I'm pretty sure this is exploitable.

This gets one header injected, "Location" booted off for me:
report-tablebogus%0aInjected-Hdr:val%00
This gets more than one header injected for MSIE/Chrome:
report-tablebogus%0dInjected-Hdr:val%00
The version of mod\_perl on my test system is a bit rusty, so let me know if you can't repro.
There are many odd things about this thing that make it difficult to do a quick PoC (e.g., = gets recoded as :, the behavior of %0d changes after %0a, %00 behaves differently), and browser quirks that come into play (^M handling, header parsing precedence, behavior of "Refresh" to javascript:, etc), but I am pretty sure it's possible. If you really need to be convinced, I can dig a bit more.

This works in Chrome for my test instance:
query\_format=report-tablebogus%0aRefresh:0%3Bjavascript:alert(1)%00
It used to work in Firefox, but you guys decided to disallow refresh to JS a while ago.

Yeah, thing is, header injection should \*never\* be possible in a CGI environment. I think that this is actually a bug in mod\_perl, if it's only reproducible under mod\_perl.

v3
OK, having played with Michal's example from [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=591165#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Header injection, cross-site scripting in report.cgi") with the alias field, QuickSearch correctly detects e.g. "s%0aId-Hdr:val%00" as a valid alias (the attacker just needs to file a bug and add this string in the alias field), but then, QS is indeed confused by %00 and %0a in the string as QS passed the string unfiltered to $cgi->redirect(). To fix the problem, all you need to do is to add
$alias = url\_quote($alias);
at line 251 of Quicksearch.pm, right after |if $is\_alias|.
IMO, this kind of PoC is a valid enough reason to revive [bug 313583](/show_bug.cgi?id=313583 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove long_list.cgi, showattachment.cgi and xml.cgi").

Has anybody proven yet that this is only reproducible under mod\_perl, and that it can be consistently reproduced there? %0a and %0d should never be translated by the header printer, there's no reason.

Oh, and CGI.pm lets you inject headers that way? In that case, this could be a bug in CGI.pm.

All right, I can confirm that this is a bug in CGI.pm. This will reproduce it:
print $cgi->redirect("[http://example.com/\n\n](http://example.com/%5Cn%5Cn)<html><script>alert(1)</script>");
As this may affect many Perl applications, we should first report it to the CGI.pm maintainers and if they agree that it is a bug, coordinate our release with them.

I've informed the CGI.pm maintainers. Also, a slight correction, here's a simple PoC with plain CGI.pm that actually works on my local mod\_cgi in Apache 2.2.15:
print $cgi->redirect("\n\rContent-Type: text/html\n\n<html><script>alert(1)</script>");

It's a security bug and RT has no mechanism for protecting security bugs, so I emailed the maintainers directly.

As I understand it, the fix will be to require CGI.pm 3.50 or any other relevant version which contains the security fix. I suppose we may still take the patch mkanat attached, in combination with the additional fix I proposed in [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=591165#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Header injection, cross-site scripting in report.cgi").
mkanat, does the CGI.pm maintainer plan to release 3.50 in the near future?

I just emailed the CGI.pm maintainer to ask for an update, but apparently he's out of the office until the 26th.
So that everybody else on this bug knows--the CGI.pm maintainers agree that this is a bug in CGI.pm, and they are going to fix it.
The patch that I attached probably wouldn't fix this security issue in all of Bugzilla--to do that, we'd have to override redirect() in Bugzilla::CGI. However, since this bug affects all systems using CGI.pm, I think that we shouldn't publish it until there's a fix in CGI.pm.

The CGI.pm release with the fix for this bug should be available later today.
Once it's been out for a little bit, I'm going to send out a Security Advisory simply advising people to update their CGI.pm module, along with posting a patch for all supported branches, updating the CGI.pm requirement to 3.50.

Do we really want to require 3.50 everywhere? This is going to break many installations once they upgrade, because they won't have CGI 3.50 and maybe won't know how to install it exactly. And I'm pretty sure that the Bugzilla RPM provided with some Linux distros will be updated without updating CGI.pm, as it may affect other applications too.

Well, I don't really want to require 3.50 everywhere, no, but I don't see any reasonable alternative, and this is a very serious security issue.

For 3.2 and 3.4, I would say the security advisory should be enough. Or maybe add CGI 3.50 as an optional module to get attention when running checksetup.pl? I wouldn't worry too much about 3.2, which is almost EOL. The question remains for 3.4, though.

Hmm. I like the optional module idea. That way sites who trust all their users (like fully-internal corporate installations with a small team) don't \*have\* to upgrade, but everybody else knows that they should.

So, I just tested the testcase in the URL field, and I'm still getting an alert(1) dialog, even though I had justdave upgrade the CGI.pm modules on all bmo webheads last night. Are we sure this is correctly fixed upstream?

Okay, that is bad. Is it possible that bmo is not properly using the lib/ directory? Is the lib/ directory missing from Apache's PerlSwitches line? Can I see the PerlSwitches line that the bmo webheads are using?

At the date and time of [comment 54](/show_bug.cgi?id=591165#c54 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Header injection, cross-site scripting in report.cgi"), we had reverted to CGI 3.49 on bmo because we were having severe performance issues that coincided with the upgrade and were trying to rule out all of the variables. The performance issues were determined to be unrelated, and we reupgraded to CGI 3.50 probably an hour or two after you made that comment. Retest?

I can also, unfortunately, sort of reproduce it on landfill:
<https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/report.cgi?cmd-0=1&format=table&query_format=report-tablebogus%0A%0DC%3Chtml%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E:%20s%0A%0A%0A%0AFOO>
Although it's not rendering as text/html, there is still some content being injected into the page.
It's \*not\* reproducible unless I'm running under mod\_perl, so there may also be a separate bug in the mod\_perl header-handling code.

Yeah, I thought so. When reed asked me yesterday to test on my side, I was unable to reproduce locally, using mod\_cgi. So we shouldn't send the sec adv before this is entirely fixed.

Thanks for the follow-up. A contribution to the CGI.pm test suite which triggers the remaining case would be welcome. It's less clear to me that this is a CGI.pm issue now.
There is always the option of validating the input before giving it to CGI.pm, but if there's a way that remains that CGI.pm could be better handling invalid input, I'm continue to be interested to know about it.

I looked into this further. Here's a reduced test case for it which reproduces a behavior with CGI.pm:
my $cgi = CGI->new('t=bogus%0D%0A<html>');
my $out = $cgi->redirect( $cgi->param('t') );
unlike($out, qr/s\n\n<html/, "redirect does not allow double-newline injection");
The issue is that CGI.pm has interpreted the spec strictly, and explicitly interprets CRLF as being CR + LF. The example here uses "\n\n". In mod\_perl CGI.pm's call the "send\_cgi\_header()" method with the value, and your Apache 2.2 then accepts "\n\n" as a valid header/body separator and allows the content through.
I'll have to consider how we might address this in CGI.pm. A reference how to treat "\n" as a valid CRLF value would be helpful.
Bugzilla also has the alternative of validating untrusted user input before handing it to CGI.pm.

CGI.pm 3.51 is now available via install-module.pl--could we update the requirement on all branches?

I can go ahead and land it, but <http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/CGI.pm-3.51/> still says "UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE", so I'm a bit skeptical about it.

Yeah, Mark is working on getting that fixed. install-module still finds it, though.

  Version 3.23
  1. Typo in upload() persisted, now fixed for real. Thanks to

  Version 3.20
  1. Patch from David Wheeler for CGI::Cookie->bake(). Uses mod_perl headers_out->add()
	rather than headers_out->set().
  2. Fixed problem identified by Andrei Voronkov in which start_form() output was screwed
	up when initial argument begins with a dash and subsequent arguments do not.
  3. Quashed uninitialized variable warnings coming from script_name(), url() and other
        functions that require access to the PATH_INFO environment variable.

  Version 3.19
  1. Added patch from Stephen Frost that allows one to suppress use of the temp file that is
	created during uploads.
  2. Fixed problem noted by Martin Foster in which regular expression meta-character terms
	in the path information were not quoted, causing URL parsing
	to fail on URLs that contained metacharacters (such as +).
  3. More fixes to the url() method.
  4. Removed "hack to fix broken PATH_INFO in MSII".

  Version 3.18
  1.  Doc typo fixes.
  2.  Patch from Steve Peters to default the document type to match the charset.
  3.  Fixed param() so that param(-name=>'foo',-values=>[]) sets the parameter to empty list.

  Version 3.17 Fri Feb 24 14:01:27 EST 2006
   1. Added patch from Mike Hanafey which caused 0 arguments to CGI::Cookie->new() to
	be treated as empty.
   2. Patch to CGI::Carp from Peter Whaite to fix the unfixable problem of CGI::Carp
     not behaving correctly in an eval() context.
   3. CGI::Fast->new() calls CGI->_reset_globals to avoid contamination of one session
	with another's variables.
   4. Fixed upload failure on files that contain semicolons in their names.

  Version 3.16 Wed Feb  8 13:29:11 EST 2006
   1. header() -charset option now works even when the MIME type is not "text".
   2. Fixed documentation for cookie() function and fastCGI.
   3. Upload filehandles now only closed automatically on Windows systems.
   4. Apache::Cookie compatibility fix from David Wheeler
   5. CGI::Carp->fatalsToBrowser() does not work correctly with
	mod_perl 2. No workaround is known.
   6. Fixed text status code associated with 302 redirects. Should be "Found"
	but was "Moved".
   7. Fixed charset in start_html() and header() to be in synch.

  Version 3.15 Wed Dec  7 15:13:22 EST 2005
   1. Remove extraneous "?" from self_url() when URI contains a ? but no query string.

  Version 3.14 Tue Dec  6 17:12:03 EST 2005
   1. Fixed broken scrolling_list() select attribute.

  Version 3.13
    1. Removed extraneous empty "?" from end of self_url().

  Version 3.12
    1. Fixed virtual_port so that it works properly with https protocol.
    2. Fixed documentation for upload_hook().
    3. Added POSTDATA documentation.
    4. Made upload_hook() work in function-oriented mode.
    5. Fixed POST_MAX behavior so that it doesn't cause client to hang.
    6. Disabled automatic tab indexes and added new -tabindex pragma to
	turn automatic indexes back on.
    7. The url() and self_url() methods now work better in the context of Apache
       mod_rewrite. Be advised that path_info() may give you confusing results
       when mod_rewrite is active because Apache calculates the path info *after*
       rewriting. This is mostly worked around in url() and self_url(), but you
       may notice some anomalies.
    8. Removed empty (and non-validating) <div> from code emitted by end_form().
    9. Fixed CGI::Carp to work correctly with Mod_perl 1.29 in an Apache 2 environment.
   10. Setting $CGI::TMPDIRECTORY should now be effective.

  Version 3.11
    1. Killed warning in CGI::Cookie about MOD_PERL_API_VERSION
    2. Fixed append() so that it works in function mode.
    3. Workaround for a bug that appears in Apache2 versions through 2.0.54
       in which SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO are incorrect if the additional path_info
       contains a double slash. This workaround will handle the common case of
       http://mysite.com/cgi-bin/log.cgi/http://www.some.other.site/args, but will
       not handle the uncommon case of a ScriptAlias directive that adds additional
       path information to the end of the translated URI.

  Version 3.10
    1. Added Apache2::RequestIO, which is necessary for mp2 interoperability.

  Version 3.09
    1. Fixed tabindex="0" when using CGI to create forms without a prior start_html
    2. Removed warning about non-numeric MOD_PERL_API_VERSION.

  Version 3.08
    1. update support for mod_perl 2.0.  versions prior to
       mod_perl 1.999_22 (2.0.0-RC5) are no longer supported.

  Version 3.07
    1. Fixed typo in mod_perl detection.

  Version 3.06

    1. Fixed bare call to script() in start_html
    2. Moved Fh::DESTROY out of autoloaded functions so as to avoid
       clobbering $@ when CGI functions are executed in an eval{}
       context.
    3. mod_perl 2.0 version detection patch in CGI::Cookie provided by
       Allen Day.

	by accessibility guidelines.
   11. The <?xml> directive produced by start_html is now turned off by

        IE6 (and maybe some versions of Opera) were getting confused by this.
   12. Support for tab indexes.
   13. Retired the HTML docs.  The POD docs are now primary documentation.
   14. CGI::Carp now correctly detects and handles Apache::Dispatch.

    2. Fixed CGI::_set_attributes so that attributes with a - are handled
       correctly.
    3. Fixed CGI::Carp::die() so as to avoid problems from _longmess()
       clobbering @_.
    4. If HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST is defined (i.e. running under a proxy),
       the various functions that return HOST will use that instead.
    5. Fix for undefined utf8() call in CGI::Util.
    6. Changed the call to warningsToBrowser() in
       CGI::Carp::fatalsToBrowser to call only after HTTP header is sent

       to fix problems with Apache.
   14. Fixed incorrect processing of multipart form fields that contain
       embedded quotes. There's still the issue of how to handle ones
       that contain embedded semicolons, but no one has complained (yet).

    2. Charset is now correctly saved and restored when saving to files
    3. url() now works correctly when given scripts with %20 and other
       escapes in the additional path info. This undoes a patch

       ISO-8861 character sets.
    2. checkbox() function now defaults to using -value as its label,

       documented from the beginning.
    3. -style accepts array reference to incorporate multiple stylesheets
       into document.

    1. Fixed two bugs that caused the -compile pragma to fail with a
       syntax error.

  Version 2.67

    1. Added XHTML support (incomplete; tags need to be lowercased).
    2. Fixed CGI/Carp when running under mod_perl. Probably broke in
       other contexts.
    3. Fixed problems when passing multiple cookies.
    4. Suppress warnings from _tableize() that were appearing when using
       -w switch with radio_group() and checkbox_group().

       pages a default file name when saving to disk.

  Version 2.66

       machines without fork().
    2. Changed make_attributes() to automatically escape any HTML
       reserved characters.
    3. Minor documentation fix in javascript example.

  Version 2.64

    1. Changes introduced in 2.63 broke param() when retrieving parameter
       lists containing only a single argument. This is now fixed.
    2. self_url() now defaults to returning parameters delimited with
       semicolon. Use the pragma -oldstyle_urls to get the old "&"
       delimiter.

  Version 2.63

    1. Fixed CGI::Push to pull out parameters correctly.
    2. Fixed redirect() so that it works with default character set

    3. Added charset() method and the -charset argument to header().
    4. Fixed behavior of escapeHTML() to respect charset() and to escape
       nasty Windows characters (thanks to Tom Christiansen).
    5. Handle REDIRECT_QUERY_STRING correctly.
    6. Removed use_named_parameters() because of dependency problems and
       general lameness.
    7. Fixed problems with bad HREF links generated by url(-relative=>1)
       when the url is like /people/.
    8. Silenced a warning on upload (patch provided by Jonas Liljegren)

  Version 2.54

    1. This will be the last release of the monolithic CGI.pm module.
       Later versions will be modularized and optimized.
    2. DOMAIN tag no longer added to cookies by default. This will break
       some versions of Internet Explorer, but will avoid breaking
       networks which use host tables without fully qualified domain
       names. For compatibility, please always add the -domain tag when
       creating cookies.
    3. Fixed escape() method so that +'s are treated correctly.
    4. Updated CGI::Pretty module.

  Version 2.53

    1. Forgot to upgrade regression tests before releasing 2.52. NOTHING

       5.0 (and Netscape 5.0 too?)
    2. Numerous HTML compliance problems in cgi_docs.html; fixed thanks
       to Michael Leahy

  Version 2.50

    1. Added a new Vars() method to retrieve all parameters as a tied
       hash.
    2. Untainted tainted tempfile name so that script doesn't fail on
       terminal unlink.
    3. Made picking of upload tempfile name more intelligent so that
       doesn't fail in case of name collision.
    4. Fixed handling of expire times when passed an absolute timestamp.
    5. Changed dump() to Dump() to avoid name clashes.

    3. Fixed bug in escapeHTML() which caused certain constructs, such as
       CGI->image_button(), to fail.
    4. Fixed bug which caused strong('CGI') to fail. Be careful to use
       CGI::strong('CGI') and not CGI->strong('CGI'). The latter will
       produce confusing results.
    5. Added upload() function, as a preferred replacement for the
       "filehandle as string" feature.
    6. Added cgi_error() function.
    7. Rewrote file upload handling to return undef rather than dieing
       when an error is encountered. Be sure to call cgi_error() to find
       out what went wrong.

  Version 2.46

    1. Fix for failure of the "include" tests under mod_perl
    2. Added end_multipart_form to prevent failures during qw(-compile
       :all)

  Version 2.45

    1. Multiple small documentation fixes

    3. Added Brian Paulsen's CGI::Pretty package for pretty-printing
       output HTML.
    4. Removed CGI::Apache and CGI::Switch from the distribution.
    5. Generated start_* shortcuts so that start_table(), end_table(),
       start_ol(), end_ol(), and so forth now work (see the docs on how
       to enable this feature).
    6. Changed accept() to Accept(), sub() to Sub(). There's still a
       conflict with reset(), but this will break too many existing
       scripts!

  Version 2.43

    1. Fixed problem with "use strict" and file uploads (thanks to Peter
       Haworth)
    2. Fixed problem with not MSIE 3.01 for the power_mac not doing file
       uploads right.
    3. Fixed problem with file upload on IIS 4.0 when authorization in
       use.

       as synonyms for -type.
    5. CGI::Carp now escapes the ampersand BEFORE escaping the > and <
       signs.
    6. Fixed "not an array reference" error when passing a hash reference
       to radio_group().
    7. Fixed non-removal of uploaded TMP files on NT platforms which
       occurs when server runs on non-C drive (thanks to Steve Kilbane
       for finding this one).

  Version 2.42

    1. Too many screams of anguish at changed behavior of url(). Is now
       back to its old behavior by default, with options to generate all
       the variants.
    2. Added regression tests. "make test" now works.
    3. Documentation fixes.
    4. Fixes for Macintosh uploads, but uploads STILL do not work pending
       changes to MacPerl.

  Version 2.41

    1. url() method now includes the path info. Use script_name() to get
       it without path info().
    2. Changed handling of empty attributes in HTML tag generation. Be
       warned! Use table({-border=>undef}) rather than
       table({-border=>''}).
    3. Changes to allow uploaded filenames to be compared to other
       strings with "eq", "cmp" and "ne".
    4. Changes to allow CGI.pm to coexist more peacefully with
       ActiveState PerlEX.
    5. Changes to prevent exported variables from clashing when importing
       ":all" set in combination with cookies.

  Version 2.40

    1. CGI::Carp patched to work better with mod_perl (thanks to Chris
       Dean).
    2. Uploads of files whose names begin with numbers or the Windows
       \\UNC\shared\file nomenclature should no longer fail.
    3. The <STYLE> tag (for cascading style sheets) now generates the
       required TYPE attribute.
    4. Server push primitives added, thanks to Ed Jordan.
    5. Table and other HTML3 functions are now part of the :standard set.
    6. Small documentation fixes.

   TO DO:
    1. Do something about the DTD mess. The module should generate
       correct DTDs, or at least offer the programmer a way to specify
       the correct one.
    2. Split CGI.pm into CGI processing and HTML-generating modules.
    3. More robust file upload (?still not working on the Macintosh?).
    4. Bring in all the HTML4 functionality, particular the accessibility
       features.

  Version 2.39

    1. file uploads failing because of VMS patch; fixed.
    2. -dtd parameter was not being properly processed.

  Version 2.38

   I finally got tired of all the 2.37 betas and released 2.38. The main
   difference between this version and the last 2.37 beta (2.37b30) are
   some fixes for VMS. This should allow file upload to work properly on
   all VMS Web servers.

  Version 2.37, various beta versions

    1. Added a CGI::Cookie::parse() method for lucky mod_perl users.
    2. No longer need separate -values and -labels arguments for
       multi-valued form elements.
    3. Added better interface to raw cookies (fix courtesy Ken Fox,
       kfox@ford.com)
    4. Added param_fetch() function for direct access to parameter list.
    5. Fix to checkbox() to allow for multi-valued single checkboxes
       (weird problem).
    6. Added a compile() method for those who want to compile without
       importing.
    7. Documented the import pragmas a little better.
    8. Added a -compile switch to the use clause for the long-suffering
       mod_perl and Perl compiler users.
    9. Fixed initialization routines so that FileHandle and type globs
       work correctly (and hash initialization doesn't fail!).
   10. Better deletion of temporary files on NT systems.
   11. Added documentation on escape(), unescape(), unescapeHTML() and
       unescapeHTML() subroutines.
   12. Added documentation on creating subclasses.
   13. Fixed problem when calling $self->SUPER::foo() from inheriting
       subclasses.
   14. Fixed problem using filehandles from within subroutines.
   15. Fixed inability to use the string "CGI" as a parameter.
   16. Fixed exponentially growing $FILLUNIT bug
   17. Check for undef filehandle in read_from_client()
   18. Now requires the UNIVERSAL.pm module, present in Perl 5.003_7 or
       higher.
   19. Fixed problem with uppercase-only parameters being ignored.
   20. Fixed vanishing cookie problem.
   21. Fixed warning in initialize_globals() under mod_perl.
   22. File uploads from Macintosh versions of MSIE should now work.
   23. Pragmas now preceded by dashes (-nph) rather than colons (:nph).
       Old style is supported for backward compatability.
   24. Can now pass arguments to all functions using {} brackets,
       resolving historical inconsistencies.
   25. Removed autoloader warnings about absent MultipartBuffer::DESTROY.
   26. Fixed non-sticky checkbox() when -name used without -value.
   27. Hack to fix path_info() in IIS 2.0. Doesn't help with IIS 3.0.
   28. Parameter syntax for debugging from command line now more
       straightforward.
   29. Added $DISABLE_UPLOAD to disable file uploads.
   30. Added $POST_MAX to error out if POSTings exceed some ceiling.
   31. Fixed url_param(), which wasn't working at all.
   32. Fixed variable suicide problem in s///e expressions, where the
       autoloader was needed during evaluation.
   33. Removed excess spaces between elements of checkbox and radio
       groups
   34. Can now create "valueless" submit buttons
   35. Can now set path_info as well as read it.
   36. ReadParse() now returns a useful function result.
   37. import_names() now allows you to optionally clear out the
       namespace before importing (for mod_perl users)
   38. Made it possible to have a popup menu or radio button with a value
       of "0".
   39. link() changed to Link() to avoid overriding native link function.
   40. Takes advantage of mod_perl's register_cleanup() function to clear
       globals.
   41. <LAYER> and <ILAYER> added to :html3 functions.
   42. Fixed problems with private tempfiles and NT/IIS systems.
   43. No longer prints the DTD by default (I bet no one will complain).
   44. Allow underscores to replace internal hyphens in parameter names.
   45. CGI::Push supports heterogeneous MIME types and adjustable delays
       between pages.
   46. url_param() method added for retrieving URL parameters even when a
       fill-out form is POSTed.
   47. Got rid of warnings when radio_group() is called.
   48. Cookies now moved to their very own module.
   49. Fixed documentation bug in CGI::Fast.
   50. Added a :no_debug pragma to the import list.

  Version 2.36

    1. Expanded JavaScript functionality
    2. Preliminary support for cascading stylesheets
    3. Security fixes for file uploads:
          + Module will bail out if its temporary file already exists
          + Temporary files can now be made completely private to avoid
            peeking by other users or CGI scripts.
    4. use CGI qw/:nph/ wasn't working correctly. Now it is.
    5. Cookie and HTTP date formats didn't meet spec. Thanks to Mark
       Fisher (fisherm@indy.tce.com) for catching and fixing this.

   p

  Version 2.35

    1. Robustified multipart file upload against incorrect syntax in
       POST.
    2. Fixed more problems with mod_perl.

    1. Improved support for Apache's mod_perl.
    2. Changes to better support inheritance.

    2. cookie() without any arguments returns all the cookies passed to a
       script.
    3. Removed annoying warnings about $ENV{NPH} when running with the -w
       switch.
    4. Removed operator overloading throughout to make compatible with
       new versions of perl.
    5. -expires now implies the -date header, to avoid clock skew.
    6. WebSite passes cookies in $ENV{COOKIE} rather than
       $ENV{HTTP_COOKIE}. We now handle this, even though it's O'Reilly's
       fault.
    7. Tested successfully against new sfio I/O layer.
    8. Documentation fixes.

  Version 2.30

    1. Automatic detection of operating system at load time.
    2. Changed select() function to Select() in order to avoid conflict
       with Perl built-in.
    3. Added Tr() as an alternative to TR(); some people think it looks
       better that way.
    4. Fixed problem with autoloading of MultipartBuffer::DESTROY code.
    5. Added the following methods:
          + virtual_host()
          + server_software()
    6. Automatic NPH mode when running under Microsoft IIS server.

  Version 2.29

    1. Fixed cookie bugs
    2. Fixed problems that cropped up when useNamedParameters was set to
       1.
    3. Prevent CGI::Carp::fatalsToBrowser() from crapping out when
       encountering a die() within an eval().
    4. Fixed problems with filehandle initializers.

  Version 2.28

    1. Added support for NPH scripts; also fixes problems with Microsoft
       IIS.
    2. Fixed a problem with checkbox() values not being correctly saved
       and restored.
    3. Fixed a bug in which CGI objects created with empty string
       initializers took on default values from earlier CGI objects.
    4. Documentation fixes.

  Version 2.27

    1. Small but important bug fix: the automatic capitalization of tag
       attributes was accidentally capitalizing the VALUES as well as the
       ATTRIBUTE names (oops).

  Version 2.26

    1. Changed behavior of scrolling_list(), checkbox() and
       checkbox_group() methods so that defaults are honored correctly.
       The "fix" causes endform() to generate additional <INPUT
       TYPE="HIDDEN"> tags -- don't be surpised.
    2. Fixed bug involving the detection of the SSL protocol.
    3. Fixed documentation error in position of the -meta argument in
       start_html().

    5. start_html() now generates correct SGML header:
      <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">

    1. Fixed bug that caused bad redirection on destination URLs with
       arguments.
    2. Fixed bug involving use_named_parameters() followed by
       start_multipart_form()
    3. Fixed bug that caused incorrect determination of binmode for
       Macintosh.
    4. Spelling fixes on documentation.

  Version 2.24

    1. Fixed bug that caused generation of lousy HTML for some form
       elements
    2. Fixed uploading bug in Windows NT
    3. Some code cleanup (not enough)

  Version 2.23

    1. Fixed an obscure bug that caused scripts to fail mysteriously.
    2. Fixed auto-caching bug.
    3. Fixed bug that prevented HTML shortcuts from passing taint checks.
    4. Fixed some -w warning problems.

  Version 2.22

    1. New CGI::Fast module for use with FastCGI protocol. See pod
       documentation for details.
    2. Fixed problems with inheritance and autoloading.
    3. Added TR() (<tr>) and PARAM() (<param>) methods to list of
       exported HTML tag-generating functions.
    4. Moved all CGI-related I/O to a bottleneck method so that this can
       be overridden more easily in mod_perl (thanks to Doug MacEachern).
    5. put() method as substitute for print() for use in mod_perl.
    6. Fixed crash in tmpFileName() method.
    7. Added tmpFileName(), startform() and endform() to export list.
    8. Fixed problems with attributes in HTML shortcuts.
    9. Functions that don't actually need access to the CGI object now no
       longer generate a default one. May speed things up slightly.
   10. Aesthetic improvements in generated HTML.
   11. New examples.

  Version 2.21

    1. Added the -meta argument to start_html().
    2. Fixed hidden fields (again).
    3. Radio_group() and checkbox_group() now return an appropriate
       scalar value when called in a scalar context, rather than
       returning a numeric value!
    4. Cleaned up the formatting of form elements to avoid unesthetic
       extra spaces within the attributes.
    5. HTML elements now correctly include the closing tag when
       parameters are present but null: em('')
    6. Added password_field() to the export list.

  Version 2.20

    1. Dumped the SelfLoader because of problems with running with taint
       checks and rolled my own. Performance is now significantly
       improved.
    2. Added HTML shortcuts.
    3. import() now adheres to the Perl module conventions, allowing
       CGI.pm to import any or all method names into the user's name
       space.
    4. Added the ability to initialize CGI objects from strings and
       associative arrays.
    5. Made it possible to initialize CGI objects with filehandle
       references rather than filehandle strings.
    6. Added the delete_all() and append() methods.
    7. CGI objects correctly initialize from filehandles on NT/95 systems
       now.
    8. Fixed the problem with binary file uploads on NT/95 systems.
    9. Fixed bug in redirect().
   10. Added '-Window-target' parameter to redirect().
   11. Fixed import_names() so that parameter names containing funny
       characters work.
   12. Broke the unfortunate connection between cookie and CGI parameter
       name space.
   13. Fixed problems with hidden fields whose values are 0.
   14. Cleaned up the documentation somewhat.

  Version 2.19

    1. Added cookie() support routines.
    2. Added -expires parameter to header().
    3. Added cgi-lib.pl compatability mode.
    4. Made the module more configurable for different operating systems.
    5. Fixed a dumb bug in JavaScript button() method.

  Version 2.18

    1. Fixed a bug that corrects a hang that occurs on some platforms
       when processing file uploads. Unfortunately this disables the
       check for bad Netscape uploads.
    2. Fixed bizarre problem involving the inability to process uploaded
       files that begin with a non alphabetic character in the file name.
    3. Fixed a bug in the hidden fields involving the -override directive
       being ignored when scalar defaults were passed.
    4. Added documentation on how to disable the SelfLoader features.

  Version 2.17

    1. Added support for the SelfLoader module.
    2. Added oodles of JavaScript support routines.
    3. Fixed bad bug in query_string() method that caused some parameters
       to be silently dropped.
    4. Robustified file upload code to handle premature termination by
       the client.
    5. Exported temporary file names on file upload.
    6. Removed spurious "uninitialized variable" warnings that appeared
       when running under 5.002.
    7. Added the Carp.pm library to the standard distribution.
    8. Fixed a number of errors in this documentation, and probably added
       a few more.
    9. Checkbox_group() and radio_group() now return the buttons as
       arrays, so that you can incorporate the individual buttons into
       specialized tables.
   10. Added the '-nolabels' option to checkbox_group() and
       radio_group(). Probably should be added to all the other
       HTML-generating routines.
   11. Added the url() method to recover the URL without the entire query
       string appended.
   12. Added request_method() to list of environment variables available.
   13. Would you believe it? Fixed hidden fields again!

  Version 2.16

    1. Fixed hidden fields yet again.
    2. Fixed subtle problems in the file upload method that caused
       intermittent failures (thanks to Keven Hendrick for this one).
    3. Made file upload more robust in the face of bizarre behavior by
       the Macintosh and Windows Netscape clients.
    4. Moved the POD documentation to the bottom of the module at the
       request of Stephen Dahmen.
    5. Added the -xbase parameter to the start_html() method, also at the
       request of Stephen Dahmen.
    6. Added JavaScript form buttons at Stephen's request. I'm not sure
       how to use this Netscape extension correctly, however, so for now
       the form() method is in the module as an undocumented feature. Use
       at your own risk!

  Version 2.15

    1. Added the -override parameter to all field-generating methods.
    2. Documented the user_name() and remote_user() methods.
    3. Fixed bugs that prevented empty strings from being recognized as
       valid textfield contents.
    4. Documented the use of framesets and added a frameset example.

  Version 2.14

   This was an internal experimental version that was never released.

  Version 2.13

    1. Fixed a bug that interfered with the value "0" being entered into
       text fields.

  Version 2.01

    1. Added -rows and -columns to the radio and checkbox groups. No
       doubt this will cause much grief because it seems to promise a
       level of meta-organization that it doesn't actually provide.
    2. Fixed a bug in the redirect() method -- it was not truly HTTP/1.0
       compliant.

  Version 2.0

   The changes seemed to touch every line of code, so I decided to bump
   up the major version number.
    1. Support for named parameter style method calls. This turns out
       to be a big win for extending CGI.pm when Netscape adds new HTML
       "features".
    2. Changed behavior of hidden fields back to the correct "sticky"
       behavior. This is going to break some programs, but it is for
       the best in the long run.
    3. Netscape 2.0b2 broke the file upload feature. CGI.pm now handles
       both 2.0b1 and 2.0b2-style uploading. It will probably break again
       in 2.0b3.
    4. There were still problems with library being unable to distinguish
       between a form being loaded for the first time, and a subsequent
       loading with all fields blank. We now forcibly create a default
       name for the Submit button (if not provided) so that there's
       always at least one parameter.
    5. More workarounds to prevent annoying spurious warning messages
       when run under the -w switch. -w is seriously broken in perl
       5.001!

  Version 1.57

    1. Support for the Netscape 2.0 "File upload" field.
    2. The handling of defaults for selected items in scrolling lists and
       multiple checkboxes is now consistent.

  Version 1.56

    1. Created true "pod" documentation for the module.
    2. Cleaned up the code to avoid many of the spurious "use of
       uninitialized variable" warnings when running with the -w switch.
    3. Added the autoEscape() method. v
    4. Added string interpolation of the CGI object.
    5. Added the ability to pass additional parameters to the <BODY> tag.
    6. Added the ability to specify the status code in the HTTP header.

  Bug fixes in version 1.55

    1. Every time self_url() was called, the parameter list would grow.
       This was a bad "feature".
    2. Documented the fact that you can pass "-" to radio_group() in
       order to prevent any button from being highlighted by default.

  Bug fixes in version 1.54

    1. The user_agent() method is now documented;
    2. A potential security hole in import() is now plugged.
    3. Changed name of import() to import_names() for compatability with
       CGI:: modules.

  Bug fixes in version 1.53

    1. Fixed several typos in the code that were causing the following
       subroutines to fail in some circumstances
         1. checkbox()
         2. hidden()
    2. No features added

  New features added in version 1.52

    1. Added backslashing, quotation marks, and other shell-style escape
       sequences to the parameters passed in during debugging off-line.
    2. Changed the way that the hidden() method works so that the default
       value always overrides the current one.
    3. Improved the handling of sticky values in forms. It's now less
       likely that sticky values will get stuck.
    4. If you call server_name(), script_name() and several other methods
       when running offline, the methods now create "dummy" values to
       work with.

  Bugs fixed in version 1.51

    1. param() when called without arguments was returning an array of
       length 1 even when there were no parameters to be had. Bad bug!
       Bad!
    2. The HTML code generated would break if input fields contained the
       forbidden characters ">< or &. You can now use these characters
       freely.

  New features added in version 1.50

    1. import() method allows all the parameters to be imported into a
       namespace in one fell swoop.
    2. Parameters are now returned in the same order in which they were
       defined.

  Bugs fixed in version 1.45

    1. delete() method didn't work correctly. This is now fixed.
    2. reset() method didn't allow you to set the name of the button.
       Fixed.

  Bugs fixed in version 1.44

    1. self_url() didn't include the path information. This is now fixed.

  New features added in version 1.43

    1. Added the delete() method.

  New features added in version 1.42

    1. The image_button() method to create clickable images.
    2. A few bug fixes involving forms embedded in <PRE> blocks.

  New features added in version 1.4

    1. New header shortcut methods
          + redirect() to create HTTP redirection messages.
          + start_html() to create the HTML title, complete with the
            recommended <LINK> tag that no one ever remembers to include.
          + end_html() for completeness' sake.
    2. A new save() method that allows you to write out the state of an
       script to a file or pipe.
    3. An improved version of the new() method that allows you to restore
       the state of a script from a file or pipe. With (2) this gives you
       dump and restore capabilities! (Wow, you can put a "121,931
       customers served" banner at the bottom of your pages!)
    4. A self_url() method that allows you to create state-maintaining
       hypertext links. In addition to allowing you to maintain the state
       of your scripts between invocations, this lets you work around a
       problem that some browsers have when jumping to internal links in
       a document that contains a form -- the form information gets lost.
    5. The user-visible labels in checkboxes, radio buttons, popup menus
       and scrolling lists have now been decoupled from the values sent
       to your CGI script. Your script can know a checkbox by the name of
       "cb1" while the user knows it by a more descriptive name. I've
       also added some parameters that were missing from the text fields,
       such as MAXLENGTH.
    6. A whole bunch of methods have been added to get at environment
       variables involved in user verification and other obscure
       features.

  Bug fixes

    1. The problems with the hidden fields have (I hope at last) been
       fixed.
    2. You can create multiple query objects and they will all be
       initialized correctly. This simplifies the creation of multiple
       forms on one page.
    3. The URL unescaping code works correctly now.

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
