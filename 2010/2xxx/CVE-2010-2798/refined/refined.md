{
  "CVE-2010-2798": {
    "Description": "A miscalculation of the size of the free space of the initial directory entry in a directory leaf block was found in the Linux kernel Global File System 2 (GFS2) implementation. A local, unprivileged user with write access to a GFS2-mounted file system could perform a rename operation on that file system to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, possibly resulting in a denial of service or privilege escalation.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The gfs2_dirent_find_space function in fs/gfs2/dir.c in the Linux kernel used an incorrect size value in calculations associated with sentinel directory entries. Specifically, it used GFS2_DIRENT_SIZE(0) instead of 0 when re-using sentinel directory entries during a rename operation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect size calculation for sentinel directory entries in gfs2_dirent_find_space function.",
       "Improper handling of directory entry re-use during rename operations."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local, unprivileged user could trigger a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service (kernel panic). It could possibly lead to privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker with write access to a GFS2-mounted file system can trigger the vulnerability by performing a specific rename operation on the file system.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local, unprivileged user with write access to a GFS2-mounted file system."
