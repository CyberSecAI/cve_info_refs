1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.

Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- lftp
This update of lftp improves the filename handling of downloaded files
to avoid downloading arbitrary content to unexpected locations (like
.login). (CVE-2010-2251)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libpython2\_6-1\_0
This update of python has a copy of libxmlrpc that is vulnerable to
denial of service bugs that can occur while processing malformed XML
input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,

Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- lxsession
lxsession-logout did not properly lock the screen before suspending,
hibernating and switching between users which could allow attackers with
physical access to take control of the system to obtain sensitive infor-
mation and / or execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who is
currently logged in (CVE-2010-2532).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- mono-addon-bytefx-data-mysql/bytefx-data-mysql
Mono's ASP.NET implementation did not set the 'EnableViewStateMac'
property by default. Attackers could exploit that to conduct cross-
site-scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2010-1459)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

which allows remote HTTP servers to obtain sensitive
information via a crafted document.
- CVE-2010-1993: Opera 9.52 does not properly handle an IFRAME element
with a mailto: URL in its SRC attribute, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via an HTML document with many IFRAME
elements.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS was prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities which could
allow remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code via
unspecified vectors. (CVE-2010-0438)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- popt
This update fixes the problem where RPM misses to clear the SUID/SGID
bit of old files during package updates. (CVE-2010-2059)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
This update of postgresql was pblished to fix several minor security
vulnerabilities:
- CVE-2010-1975: postgresql does not properly check privileges during
certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.
- CVE-2010-1169: Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures,
which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- python-mako
Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly
escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- vte
VTE was vulnerable to an old title set+query attack which could be used
by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2713).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- w3m
w3m did not handle embedded nul characters in the common name and in
subject alternative names of x509 certificates.
CVE-2010-2074 has been assigned to this issue.
This update also turns on verification of x509 certificates by default
which was not the case before.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- xmlrpc-c
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-14 20:59:42 UTC  ``` A bug report [1] for OpenSUSE indicates that lxsession-logout does not lock the screen before suspending, hibernating, or switching users.  A patch [2] was attached to the bug to correct the issue.  This issue would affect lxsession in Fedora.  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=622083> [2] <https://bugzillafiles.novell.org/attachment.cgi?id=375737>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-14 21:00:49 UTC  ``` Created lxsession tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 614609](show_bug.cgi?id=614609 "CLOSED WONTFIX - lxsession: does not lock the screen before suspending/hibernating/switching users [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c2)  Christoph Wickert    2010-07-14 22:40:45 UTC  ``` I'm in contact with the SUSE maintainer already but I will not apply the patch if the SUSE people don't upstream it properly. I think blindly copying patches that are not upstreamed is against our policies, see <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c3)  Christoph Wickert    2010-07-14 22:42:20 UTC  ``` P.S.: I don't consider this a vulnerability only because a person at SUSE does and I think that our security response shouldn't do ether.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-15 05:06:58 UTC  ``` I didn't file the bug to necessarily force you to adopt SUSE's patch.  The patch was noted because it was noted in their bug (honestly, the bug would have been filed whether a patch existed or not).  I'm aware of the upstream policy and I don't know what SUSE has done to approach upstream regarding it.  The bug was filed to make the maintainer aware of the situation.  However, I'm not considering this a vulnerability because someone at SUSE thinks so.  I'm considering at a vulnerability because I'm of the frame of mind that if you are hibernating or suspending your system, it is reasonable to expect to be prompted for a password when you return to it.  Is that an unreasonable expectation?  Or do you have a different argument for why you don't think this is a security issue, aside from the fact that someone at SUSE does?  (I also use the term "security issue" a little loosely here... it's more of a privacy issue since it is something you need to get your hands on physically, but if nothing else I would certainly consider this a bug and worth investigating and dealing with upstream on, whether that is via SUSE or directly).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c5)  Christoph Wickert    2010-07-15 10:55:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c4)) > I don't know what SUSE has done to approach upstream regarding it.

I'm NOT saying it is a privacy issue BECAUSE someone at SUSE thinks so, I'm saying if it is an issue, it is because of false assumptions. IMHO locking the display and suspenmding/hibernating a machine are 2 different things. If somebody has physical access to a machine, you will be in trouble anyway.  Note that we have the same in Xfce and upstream made it very clear that he has no intentions to change that behavior, see [bug 587633 comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=587633#c3 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Screen not always locked after resume from hibernate").  Anyway, waiting for SUSE to file a bug and a reaction from upstream.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c6)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-15 15:27:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c5)) > (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c4)) > > I don't know what SUSE has done to approach upstream regarding it. >  > I'm trying to figure that out.

Only because it is that way in GNOME?  Not just GNOME, but most operating systems IIRC.  Not sure about Windows, but OS X does this, and I suspect KDE does this as well.   > > Is that an unreasonable expectation?

I don't think it's necessarily a false assumption, just a reasonable one.  Of course you're in trouble if someone has physical access to a machine.  But again, this is more of a privacy thing than a security thing.   > Note that we have the same in Xfce and upstream made it very clear that he has > no intentions to change that behavior, see [bug 587633 comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=587633#c3 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Screen not always locked after resume from hibernate").  That's fine; upstream XFCE is certainly entitled to their opinion on their own sofware.  This bug has nothing to do with XFCE.  Using the same argument, I can say that we _do_ have this support in GNOME.   > Anyway, waiting for SUSE to file a bug and a reaction from upstream.      Thank you.  If nothing else, and upstream indicates this is expected/normal/desired behaviour, we have something to point to that indicates this is not a bug or deficiency of any kind.  Considering SUSE has requested a CVE for this issue, this bug would have been created anyway:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3197>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-16 20:00:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned the name [CVE-2010-2532](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2532).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c8)  Christoph Wickert    2010-07-16 22:16:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c6))  > I don't think it's necessarily a false assumption, just a reasonable one.  Honestly, I wouldn't expect it. It's reasonable because it's based on expectations which in turn are based on other operating systems or desktop environments. If we followed that logik, we could file plenty of bugs.  > Of course you're in trouble if someone has physical access to a machine.

On the one hand Xfce is entitled to their opinion, but on the other hand LXDE is not and needs to do what the SUSE security team decides behind their backs?  I'm having serious problems with both the SUSE approach and their patch (as outlined in <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=622083#c7>)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c9)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-16 22:49:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c8)) > > I don't think it's necessarily a false assumption, just a reasonable one. >  > Honestly, I wouldn't expect it.

Therefor it was wrong IMHO > to request a CVE because it is not a vulnerability in the code.  Yes, I said it was a privacy issue.  A CVE name was requested and assigned.  Not, I might add, by myself.  You can feel as strongly about this as you like, one way or the other, but it doesn't change the fact that SUSE requested a CVE, and it was given.  Now, if the LXDE upstream want to dispute this as being a concious design decision, then let's do that.  But complaining about a CVE being assigned isn't productive.  As an aside, it doesn't have to be a vulnerability in the code to obtain a CVE.. a deficient design or implementation (where the code is technically correct) is enough.   > > That's fine; upstream XFCE is certainly entitled to their opinion on their own > > sofware.

Who said that?   > I'm having serious problems with both the SUSE approach and their patch (as > outlined in <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=622083#c7>)      I would agree.  They should have taken this to upstream first.  Unfortunately, that did not happen and now we have an issue (whether it is a bug, security, privacy, whatever, is still up for debate) and a CVE name.  That is enough to create the bug to track it.  What happens after that doesn't negate the need for the bug.  Of course, arbitrarily dismissing this is just as arrogant as the SUSE approach, is it not?  Have you brought this up with upstream yet?  Or are you still relying on SUSE to do it (and do you expect them to do it properly, since you're having serious problems with their approach)?  Not that I blame you on that point.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c10)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-14 17:30:22 UTC  ``` This issue still seems to be unresolved, so I'm assuming it has not been fixed in Fedora at all as of yet:  <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3030798&group_id=180858&atid=894869>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c11)  Christoph Wickert    2011-06-14 20:38:01 UTC  ``` Don't forget to file a bug against GNOME 2 and 3, it doesn't lock the display either.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c12)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-17 22:57:32 UTC  ``` We're not talking about GNOME 2 and 3 here.  We're talking about this bug.  And _this_ issue is still unresolved, yes?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c13)  Christoph Wickert    2011-06-17 23:25:44 UTC  ``` We are talking about this "issue" and in order to determine if it is an *issue* at all, I suggested a look at other desktops handle this. Both Xfce and GNOME don't lock the screen either.  Since you are member of the security response team I'd expect you to 1. first of all do a risk evaluation 2. then talk to upstream 3. file bugs upstream if necessary 4. file bugs for the packages in question and add a reference to the upstream bug reports.  If you are really concerned about security, you should file bugs for the other components as well. If you are just trying to get good numbers for statistics, I can't help it.  Sorry if I sound rude here, but I will not maintain something that a fix is not upstreamed if it fixes an issue that IHMO is no issue.  I will be happy to issue an update as soon as there is a patch available that is a) upstreamed b) makes locking configurable.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c14)  Christoph Wickert    2011-06-18 11:53:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c13)) > Both Xfce and GNOME don't lock the screen either.

I do not think that this should be a permanent feature of LXDE experience. I agree with Christoph's opinions here that this is about *customization*.
