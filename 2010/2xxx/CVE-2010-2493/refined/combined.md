| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=614774#c0)  Marc Schoenefeld    2010-07-15 08:52:28 UTC  ``` The deployment descriptor (web.xml) of picketlink-sts.war in the security_saml quickstart, the webservice_proxy_security quickstart, and some of the included web applications (web-console, http-invoker, gpd-deployer, jbpm-console, contract, and uddi-console), contained a configuration that could allow an attacker to bypass the application's security with a crafted HTTP request. To resolve these issues, the following lines have been removed from the web.xml files of the affected quickstarts and applications:  <http-method>GET</http-method> <http-method>POST</http-method>  If the security_saml quickstart was used to create another application, then that new application will need to be reviewed to ensure it does not have this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=614774#c1)  Murray McAllister    2010-07-15 12:12:18 UTC  ``` Statement:  These issues were fixed by the 5.0.2 release of the JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform, available for download from the Red Hat Customer Portal: <https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=soaplatform&downloadType=distributions&version=5.0.2+GA>  The JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.0.2 Release Notes are available from <http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_SOA_Platform/5.0.2/html/5.0.2_Release_Notes/index.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
