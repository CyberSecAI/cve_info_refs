Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2010-2552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol software's insufficient handling of specially crafted SMB compounded requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed compounded requests within the SMBv2 protocol.
- Stack exhaustion due to the inefficient handling of the crafted SMB requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit can cause the affected system to become unresponsive, requiring a manual restart. The system will stop accepting requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: An attacker sends a specially crafted SMB packet over the network to a vulnerable system.
- The attack does not require authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to send network packets to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be a remote unauthenticated user.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability affects SMBv2, specifically the handling of compounded requests which is a new feature in SMBv2
- A compounded request is a method of combining multiple SMBv2 protocol requests into a single transmission.
- The vulnerability does not allow for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.
- Workarounds include:
    - Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall (may impact functionality)
    - Disabling SMBv2.
