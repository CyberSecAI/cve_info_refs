How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Not really a reference for the issue, but at least for the patch:

This changelog entry refers to td_stripoffset issue (aka CVE-2010-2443)
and it first appears in 3.9.3 changelog.  td_stripbytecount case is not
yet fixed upstream as far as I can tell.

In the past week, LibTIFF has released new versions upstream (3.9.3,
and soon after, 3.9.4) that address a number of potentially
security-relevant issues, some of which have not been assigned CVE
identifiers.  The following issues will crash (or worse) any
application linked against LibTIFF in the trivial case of viewing a
maliciously crafted image:

1.  Out-of-bounds read in TIFFExtractData() may result in application
crash (no reference, fixed upstream).  Reported by Dan Rosenberg.

2.  Out-of-bounds read in TIFFVGetField() may result in application
crash ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/tiff/+bug/589145](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/%2Bsource/tiff/%2Bbug/589145)).
 The fix for this issue was combined with the fix for CVE-2010-2065,
but it appears to be a separate issue.  Reported by Sauli Pahlman.

3.  Memory corruption in TIFFRGBAImageGet() due to buffer overflow
([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tiff/+bug/591605](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tiff/%2Bbug/591605)).
Reported by Sauli Pahlman.

There is another series of issues that each lead to an application
crash, reported at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583081>
by Nicolae Ghimbovschi.  However, these issues may require more user
assistance, such as running specific conversion tools to process TIFF
files, and as such may not need CVE identifiers.  I thought I'd
include them for completeness:

4.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2207> ("tif_getimage
fails when flipping vertically on 64-bit platforms")

5.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2208> ("Bogus
ReferenceBlackWhite values can crash libtiff")

6.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2209> ("Assertion
failure in OJPEGPostDecode") - this one is an assertion failure and
not a segfault, so it might not need a CVE.

Finally, to avoid confusion, the following more serious issues were
also fixed and have already received CVE identifiers:

7.  Integer overflows leading to heap overflow in Fax3SetupState().
Reported by Kevin Finisterre (CVE-2010-1411).

8.  Integer overflow in TIFFFillStrip() leading to heap overflow in
TIFFReadRawStrip1().  Reported by Sauli Pahlman (CVE-2010-2065).

9.  Stack overflow when processing SubjectDistance EXIF tags allows
arbitrary code execution.  Reported by Dan Rosenberg (CVE-2010-2067).

Thanks,
Dan

Do you have any info on this?  I don't see anything obviously related
in changelog.  TIFFExtractData itself and all its uses seem unchanged
for years.

This is NULL deref.  Another Sauli's test case shows that similar
problem can occur with NULL td_stripbytecount few lines below
td_stripoffset case addressed in upstream patch.

Right, not related to what CVE-2010-2065 was assigned to.

IIRC, Sauli's file only demonstrates OOB read.  Upstream bug:
<http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2216>

> 4.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2207> ("tif_getimage

CVE-2010-2233 was assigned to this issue.

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF 4.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.2-r1"

```

All libTIFF 3.9 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.9.5-r2"

```

The reason is apparent after inspecting tiffdump output:  Magic: 0x4949 <little-endian> Version: 0x2a Directory 0: offset 90 (0x5a) next 0 (0) 34911 (0x885f) LONG (4) 1<0> ImageWidth (256) SHORT (3) 1<5> ImageLength (257) SHORT (3) 1<5> BitsPerSample (258) SHORT (3) 3<8 8 8> Compression (259) SHORT (3) 1<7> ... etc etc ...  Tag 34911 is FAXDCS, which should be a string; because what's actually in the file isn't a string, a crash occurs when JPEGVSetField tries to process it.  I thought for a long time that this represented a design error in the API for VSetField functions, but actually the problem is more localized: TIFFReadDirectory is simply failing to apply the correct data type check to the FAXDCS field, because it appears out-of-order.  I am not sure if libtiff 4.0 has a related problem ... has the notion of run-time registration of fields been removed entirely?  If not, you might need to fix it too. ```  ------- *Comment [#1](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c1) From Tom Lane  2010-06-12 15:26:42* ------- ``` [Created an attachment (id=393)](attachment.cgi?id=393 "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=393&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch  Here is my proposed fix.  This works by moving processing of unknown tags into an extra pass in TIFFReadDirectory.  I had first thought we could fix it by just adding a datatype check to the existing second pass, but that fails because the first pass makes anonymous field entries for unknown tags. That actually prevents the codec from installing the correct field data, so the datatype check still succeeds :-(.  So we must not install anonymous-field entries until after the codec gets registered, and a separate pass seems like the cleanest way to do it. ```  ------- *Comment [#2](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c2) From Frank Warmerdam  2010-06-13 19:22:10* ------- ``` Patch applied as proposed in 3.9 branch.   Thanks ```  ------- *Comment [#3](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c3) From Tom Lane  2010-06-14 10:30:34* ------- ``` BTW, this patch turns out to also fix another problem: in the original coding, if fix >= tif->tif_nfields at the top of the first pass, it would just ignore the tag.  If the tag was unknown, that leads to crash in the second pass, which expects every tag to have an entry in the field array.  There is at least one code path that can lead to that situation (as exposed by another test file just submitted to Red Hat :-()). ```  ------- *Comment [#4](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c4) From Tom Lane  2010-06-16 00:39:12* ------- ``` [Created an attachment (id=396)](attachment.cgi?id=396 "incremental patch to un-break out-of-order warning") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=396&action=edit "incremental patch to un-break out-of-order warning") incremental patch to un-break out-of-order warning  Ooops ... that patch has a problem, which is that it sometimes will emit the "tags are not sorted in ascending order" warning when there isn't any such error.  The logic for doing that was more closely coupled to the tag search lookup code than I realized ... and I was mostly testing with bogus files that had that sort of problem, so I didn't realize it was complaining too much.  The cleanest fix seems to be to decouple those two activities completely, at the cost of one extra variable.  See patch. ```  ------- *Comment [#5](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c5) From Tom Lane  2010-06-16 00:39:54* ------- ``` Reopened, needs additional patch.  Sorry 'bout that. ```  ------- *Comment [#6](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c6) From Lee Howard  2010-12-13 21:42:50* ------- ``` I've applied the incremental patch to 3.9 CVS.  The patch does not apply at all to HEAD.  Thanks. ``` |

Thanks for your help Tomas, it's hard to keep all these issues straight.

Revision 1.92.2.9 of libtiff/tif_dirread.c added code for ensuring
valid tag type information for each TIFF directory entry.  Prior to
this fix, unknown tag types would result in an out-of-bounds array
index in TIFFExtractData() on any code path using this macro.  Ubuntu
security backported this fix as debian/patches/fix-unknown-tags.patch
in their libtiff4 package.

Sorry, I misread your comment on the Launchpad post - by "buffer
over-read", I now understand that you meant that libtiff attempted to
read well past the boundaries of a buffer, resulting in an
out-of-bounds read and application crash.  My mistake.
