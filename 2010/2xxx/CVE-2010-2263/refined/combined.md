TITLE: NGINX [ENGINE X] SERVER <= 0.7.65 (STABLE)/0.8.39 (DEVELOPMENT) SOURCE CODE DISCLOSURE/DOWNLOAD VULNERABILITY
TESTED OS: WINDOWS XP SP3/ WINDOWS 7 HOME PREMIUM
SEVERITY: HIGH
IMPACT: READ/DOWNLOAD SOURCE CODE OF WEB APP FILES
DISCOVERED DATE: 2010-06-04
FIXED DATE: 2010-06-07
FIXED VERSIONS: NGINX/0.8.40 AND NGINX/0.7.66
DISCOVERED BY: JOSE A. VAZQUEZ

======ABOUT APPLICATION======

"nginx [engine x] is a HTTP and reverse proxy server, as well as a mail proxy server written by Igor Sysoev.
It has been running for more than five years on many heavily loaded Russian sites including Rambler (RamblerMedia.com).
According to Netcraft nginx served or proxied 4.70% busiest sites in April 2010.
Here are some of success stories: FastMail.FM, Wordpress.com. The sources are licensed under 2-clause BSD-like
license." copied from -> http://nginx.org/en/ [ref-1]

======TESTED VERSIONS=====

Unix versions are not vulnerable (it only affects to NTFS file system)

Windows Stable versions:

nginx/0.7.66 --> Not vulnerable
nginx/0.7.65 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.7.64 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.7.63 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.7.62 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.7.61 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.7.60 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.7.59 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.7.58 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.7.56 --> Vulnerable

Windows Development versions:

nginx/0.8.40 --> Not vulnerable
nginx/0.8.39 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.38 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.37 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.36 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.35 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.34 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.33 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.32 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.31 --> Vulnerable
nginx/0.8.30 --> Vulnerable

======DESCRIPTION======

This application was vulnerable to source code disclosure/download vulnerability when
it was running in Windows OS (NTFS file system).
App parser couldn't handle ADS (Alternate Data Streams) and it treated a data stream as an
usual file. An Attacker could read/download source code of webapps files using default data
stream (unnamed): "filename::$data".

This issue is like an old security issue in Microsoft Windows IIS [ref-2].

======PROOF OF CONCEPT======

http://[IP]/[FILE]::$data

======STEPS TO REPRODUCE======

1.- Start the server.

2.- Go to http://127.0.0.1/index.html::$data

3.- Browser requests to download...yes...go to file and open it.

======REFERENCES======

[ref-1] -> http://nginx.org/
[ref-2] -> http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms98-003.mspx

======DISCLOSURE TIMELINE======

Standard Time Zone: GMT/UTC + 01:00 hour (Spain/Madrid)

[2010-06-04] => Inicial contact with vendor and sent advisory.
[2010-06-04] => Vendor response and believe that vulnerability got fixed with previous release.
[2010-06-04] => I confirm that nginx is vulnerable in Windows 7 OS.
[2010-06-04] => Vendor will try to see the issue.
[2010-06-04] => Vendor confirms the issue and he will get fixed on Monday.
[2010-06-07] => New releases out.
[2010-06-07] => I sent complete advisory and propose as disclosure date on Wednesday.
[2010-06-10] => Second chance to confirm public disclosure.
[2010-06-10] => Vendor is agree.
[2010-06-11] => Forced to public disclosure.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Computer security researching: WebApps and browsers vulnerabilities, exploits, my stuff...

### :::SPAS3C-SV-001:::NGINX [ENGINE X] SERVER <= 0.7.65 /0.8.39 SOURCE CODE DISCLOSURE/DOWNLOAD VULN. (CVE-2010-2263)

I found this vulnerability one week ago, but I was waiting a fucking CVE number when somebody published a similar advisory without checking. This researcher made a public disclosure in an old release and he also said that it isn't fixed when this is fake (at least Source Code Disclosure/Download got fixed with lastest releases).

Copied from ChangeLog for 0.8.40/0.7.66 (Final releases in stable/development channel):

-------------------------START-COPY-------------------------------

Changes with nginx 0.8.40 07 Jun 2010

 \*) Security: now nginx/Windows ignores default file stream name.
 Thanks to Jose Antonio Vazquez Gonzalez.

\*) Feature: the ngx\_http\_uwsgi\_module.
 Thanks to Roberto De Ioris.

\*) Feature: a "fastcgi\_param" directive with value starting with
 "HTTP\_" overrides a client request header line.

\*) Bugfix: the "If-Modified-Since", "If-Range", etc. client request
 header lines were passed to FastCGI-server while caching.

\*) Bugfix: listen unix domain socket could not be changed during
 reconfiguration.
 Thanks to Maxim Dounin.

But vulnerabilities databases seem that they didn't confirm nothing.

This is my advisory:

This is a visual Proof Of Concept:

Watch on youtube -> <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvQtvV8kQhY>

Be good (responsible disclosure) has disadvantages...bye bye my first software advisory :(

Update: Thanks to exploits-db and security-focus because they (will) have updated their databases and (will) have published my advisory.

Be safe ;)

Great work on responsible disclosure, and a very good find for an exploit. Keep up the work on finding the bugs :D

# Nginx 0.8.36 - Source Disclosure / Denial of Service

#### EDB-ID:

###### 13818

#### CVE:

###### [2010-2266](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-2266) [2010-2263](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-2263)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Dr\_IDE](/?author=1766)

#### Type:

###### [remote](/?type=remote)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Windows](/?platform=windows)

#### Date:

###### 2010-06-11

---

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Issue 1: (Remote Source Disclosure)
- Description -

nginx 0.8.36 is a multi platform HTTP server. This vulnerability exists in the latest Windows version of the application available.

nginx on Windows is vulnerable to a remote source disclosure attack.

- Technical Details - (Source Download)

http://[ webserver IP][:port]index.html::$DATA

Issue 2: (Remote DoS (w/ Memory Corruption))
- Description -

nginx 0.8.36 (Windows) does not seem to handle encoded directory traversal attempts properly. The corrupted registers in the crash dump seem to be loaded with damaged path variables.

- Technical Details - (Remote DoS)

http://[ webserver IP][:port]/%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%20

http://[ webserver IP][:port]/%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%20

http://[ webserver IP][:port]/%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%20

These three attempts will overwrite memory registers with different parts of the internal path based on where they try and traverse to.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
