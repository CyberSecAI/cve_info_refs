Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2263:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Nginx web server's inability to properly handle Alternate Data Streams (ADS) on Windows file systems (NTFS). The server's parser incorrectly treats a data stream as a regular file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Source Code Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to disclose the source code of web application files. This is achieved by accessing the default (unnamed) data stream of a file using the syntax "filename::$data".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read and download the source code of web applications hosted on the vulnerable Nginx server. This could expose sensitive information such as:
    *   Application logic and algorithms
    *   Database credentials
    *   API keys
    *   Other sensitive data embedded in the source code

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker crafts a URL that includes the "::$data" syntax, appended to the desired file path (e.g., http://[IP]/[FILE]::$data).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Nginx server.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to make HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Nginx running on Windows (NTFS file system). Unix versions are not affected.
*   The vulnerability is similar to an older issue found in Microsoft Windows IIS.
*   The exploit is trivial to perform and requires no special tools beyond a web browser or a simple HTTP client.
*   The issue was fixed in Nginx versions 0.7.66 and 0.8.40.

**Affected Versions (as described):**

*   **Windows Stable versions:**
    *   nginx/0.7.65 and earlier are vulnerable.
    *   nginx/0.7.66 is not vulnerable.
*   **Windows Development versions:**
    *   nginx/0.8.39 and earlier are vulnerable.
    *   nginx/0.8.40 is not vulnerable.
