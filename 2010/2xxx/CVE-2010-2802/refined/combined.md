| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=620992#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-03 22:13:34 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way that the Mantis BTS handled attachments and MIME types.  A user could upload an HTML file renamed to a .gif and Mantis would calculate the actual MIME type of the file as text/html.  A user tricked into thinking they were clicking a .gif attachment would instead have the full HTML file rendered in the browser, rather than having it treated as a downloadable file or displayed in plain text.  References:  <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=11952> <http://www.mantisbt.org/blog/?p=113>  This was corrected in upstream version 1.2.2 and affects current Fedora 12, 13, rawhide, and EPEL5.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=620992#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-03 22:14:34 UTC  ``` Created mantis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 620993](show_bug.cgi?id=620993 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2010-2802 mantis: cross-domain scripting or other browser attacks via arbitrary inline attachment rendering [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=620992#c2)  Gianluca Sforna    2010-08-04 07:26:57 UTC  ``` Hi Vincent, thanks for the report. It seems to me the flaw reported here affects 1.2.x versions. The version we are still shipping in all Fedora/EPEL branches (1.1.8) is not affected by the flaw.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=620992#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-04 15:20:13 UTC  ``` Ah yes, you're absolutely correct.  I missed the part in the blog post indicating it was 1.2.x.  Thanks for looking, I'll close this and the tracker then.   ``` |  |

| Summary | 0011952: Arbitrary inline attachment rendering could lead to cross-domain scripting or other browser attacks | | | | |
| Description | Kornel Lesinski reported a significant security problem with Mantis' handling of attachments and MIME types. A user could upload a HTML file renamed to .gif and MantisBT would use Fileinfo to calculate the actual MIME type to be text/html. This is a problem because a user could be directed to click on a link purporting to be a .gif attachment when in fact it is a HTML document. Browsers would attempt to render the text/html attachment within the browser instead of treating it as a file download (or even just plaintext).  Internet Explorer exaggerates this problem by ignoring the Content-Type header so that it can perform its own analysis of the file type. With the expectation that Fileinfo and any browser MIME detection are inherently insecure and unpredictable, we don't want to allow users to upload random files that *could* be misinterpreted by MIME detectors for malicious purposes. As we send our own Content-Type headers where appropriate, we can tell Internet Explorer 8+ to stop it's own MIME type sniffing, resulting in a performance boost for IE8+ users. | | | | |

   I couldn’t be bothered to sign up on yet another forum and I didn’t see a ‘contact’ tab with a contact form or mail address listed anywhere, so please excuse me but just dropping a comment here was the easiest way for me to get in touch.

   With regards to your theming issues, I’d just like to point out this project:

   How can I communicate by email to add a new question (even if this issue is not assigned to anyone) in the mantis, those who subscribed to such messages.

   Is this possible? If yes, how?

   Hi

   I am using Mantis Version ‘Mantis 0.19.1’. I want to upgrade it to Mantis 1.2.2.

   I also want to move my database as well.

   I can see two options

   1. Install fresh instance of 1.2.2. Move data of version 0.19.1 to 1.2.2

   2. Upgrade the version 0.19.1 directly.

   Can any one please guide me ?

   @Newbee, here is the recommended steps to upgrade:

   1. Backup your code, configuration, attachments and database for 0.19.1.

   2. Restore the data you backed up in 1 on the new server and test.

   3. Upgrade 0.19.1 in place to 1.0.0 on the new server and test that it is working.

   4. Upgrade 1.0.0 in place to 1.2.2 on the new server and test that it is working.

   Hope this helps.
