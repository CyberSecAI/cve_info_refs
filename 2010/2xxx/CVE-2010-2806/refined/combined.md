| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=623625#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-12 10:44:13 UTC  ``` Marc Schoenefeld found an input stream position error in the way FreeType font rendering engine processed input file streams. If a user loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType and relevant font glyphs were subsequently rendered with the X FreeType library (libXft), it could cause the application to crash or, possibly execute arbitrary code (integer overflow leading to heap-based buffer overflow in the libXft library) with the privileges of the user running the application. Different vulnerability than [CVE-2010-1797](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1797).  Affected versions: freetype-2.3 and before that.

We'll also call this improper bounds checking. I'm giving it its own ID, as
the various versions affected will no doubt differ.
Use CVE-2010-2806

I'm not exactly sure what to call this one. It seems to involve improper
type comparisons (int vs long).

It was discovered that FreeType did not correctly handle certain malformed

font files. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted font

file, a remote attacker could cause FreeType to crash or possibly execute

arbitrary code with user privileges.

# RHSA-2010:0736 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: freetype security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated freetype packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
efficiently. The freetype packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 provide
both the FreeType 1 and FreeType 2 font engines.

It was discovered that the FreeType font rendering engine improperly
validated certain position values when processing input streams. If a user
loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against
FreeType, and the relevant font glyphs were subsequently rendered with the
X FreeType library (libXft), it could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow
in the libXft library, causing the application to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2010-3311)

An array index error was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed certain PostScript Type 42 font files. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2010-2806)

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed PostScript Type 1 font files that contain nested Standard
Encoding Accented Character (seac) calls. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-3054)

Note: All of the issues in this erratum only affect the FreeType 2 font
engine.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted
(log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=621980#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-06 16:51:33 UTC  ``` An array index error, leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way the FreeType font rendering engine processed FontType42 font files with negative length of certain special font name table strings. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted font file (which bypasses a size check and triggers a heap-based buffer overflow). Such file, when opened, would cause an application linked against libfreetype to crash, or, possibly execute arbitrary code.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=621980#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-06 16:51:33 UTC  ``` An array index error, leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way the FreeType font rendering engine processed FontType42 font files with negative length of certain special font name table strings. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted font file (which bypasses a size check and triggers a heap-based buffer overflow). Such file, when opened, would cause an application linked against libfreetype to crash, or, possibly execute arbitrary code.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-3804

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 4.1 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 4.1 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 3.2.2 for iPad

  Impact: Websites may surreptitiously track users

  Description: Safari generates random numbers for JavaScript applications using a predictable algorithm. This may allow a website to track a particular Safari session without using cookies, hidden form elements, IP addresses, or other techniques. This update addresses the issue by using a stronger random number generator. Credit to Amit Klein of Trusteer for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-3813

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 4.1 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 4.1 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 3.2.2 for iPad

  Impact: WebKit may perform DNS prefetching even when it is disabled

  Description: When WebKit encounters an HTML Link Element that requests DNS prefetching, it will perform the operation even if prefetching is disabled. This may result in undesired requests to remote servers. As an example, the sender of an HTML-formatted email message could use this to determine that the message was read. This issue is addressed through improved handling of DNS prefetching requests. Credit to Jeff Johnson of Rogue Amoeba Software for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-3822

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 4.1 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 4.1 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 3.2.2 for iPad

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An uninitialized pointer issue exists in WebKit's handling of CSS counter styles. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved handling of CSS counter styles. Credit to kuzzcc for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 4.1 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 4.1 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 3.2.2 for iPad

  Impact: A maliciously crafted website may be able to determine which sites a user has visited

  Description: A design issue exists in WebKit's handling of the CSS :visited pseudo-class. A maliciously crafted website may be able to determine which sites a user has visited. This update limits the ability of web pages to style pages based on whether links are visited.

| [Fri 06 Aug 2010 05:35:53 PM UTC, comment #4:](#comment4)Â   Yes, please file a new bug report, and please dig deeper since such bugs are hard to fix by me if I can reproduce them. | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |
| [Fri 06 Aug 2010 04:11:43 PM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3)Â   (gdb) p pcell  $1 = (PCell \*) 0xfc000008006a8b50   So this address is composed of two 32bit pieces.   0x006a8b50 lies perfectly in the process' address space, but the upper parth 0xfc000008 seems random. I guess it's a stack based buffer overflow, which overwrites upper part of this variable.   I can dig deeper if you need it to fix it. | [Robert Swiecki <jagger>](/users/jagger) |

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0737)

## Topic

Updated freetype packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
efficiently. The freetype packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 provide
both the FreeType 1 and FreeType 2 font engines. The freetype packages for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 provide only the FreeType 2 font engine.

It was discovered that the FreeType font rendering engine improperly
validated certain position values when processing input streams. If a user
loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against
FreeType, and the relevant font glyphs were subsequently rendered with the
X FreeType library (libXft), it could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow
in the libXft library, causing the application to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2010-3311)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font
rendering engine processed some PostScript Type 1 fonts. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2010-2808)

An array index error was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed certain PostScript Type 42 font files. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2010-2806)

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed PostScript Type 1 font files that contain nested Standard
Encoding Accented Character (seac) calls. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-3054)

Note: All of the issues in this erratum only affect the FreeType 2 font
engine.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted
(log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
