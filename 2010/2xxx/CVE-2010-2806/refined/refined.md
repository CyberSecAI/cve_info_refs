{
  "CVE-2010-2806": {
    "Description": "An array index error, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, exists in the FreeType font rendering engine when processing FontType42 font files with a negative length for certain special font name table strings. An attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially-crafted font file, which bypasses a size check and triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. Opening such a file could cause an application linked against libfreetype to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Improper bounds checking and array index error when processing certain PostScript Type 42 font files with negative string lengths.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Application crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "Loading a specially-crafted font file via an application linked against FreeType and rendering relevant font glyphs with libXft.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious font file and entice a user to open it."
