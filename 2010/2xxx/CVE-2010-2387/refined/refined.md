Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content does *not* relate to CVE-2010-2387. The content primarily discusses vulnerabilities fixed in various Oracle products, referencing a range of CVEs. CVE-2010-2387 is not among those listed. The bugzilla content refers to a different vulnerability relating to logging user passwords in GDM and has no connection to CVE-2010-2387.

**2. Analysis of the vulnerability described in the bugzilla content**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ve_locale_from_utf8` function in GDM (GNOME Display Manager) would print a warning message, including the input string, if it was not proper UTF-8 encoded.  This exposed user passwords in system logs when passwords contained non-UTF8 characters and when GDM debug messages were enabled.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of input strings leading to sensitive information disclosure. Lack of sanitization before logging potentially sensitive data.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to system logs could potentially recover user passwords if they contained non-UTF8 characters and were logged.
*  **Attack vectors**: A user entering a password containing non UTF-8 characters. x11vnc may be a factor in sending these non-UTF-8 chars.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need read access to the system logs (/var/log/messages), which is not normally granted to unprivileged users on a system.

**3. Summary**

The provided content from `bugzilla.gnome.org` describes a vulnerability in the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) that could lead to the disclosure of user passwords in system logs. The issue is due to GDM logging the input password, without sanitization, if it contains non-UTF-8 characters. The risk is that an attacker with access to system logs can extract the passwords.
However, the other content provided (from `blogs.oracle.com` and `secunia.com`) does not relate to CVE-2010-2387 or to the vulnerability described in the bugzilla content, therefore it is UNRELATED.
