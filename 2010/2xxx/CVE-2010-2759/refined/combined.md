| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=623423#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-11 18:44:09 UTC  ``` Upstream Bugzilla has released 3.4.8 and 3.6.2 to address four security flaws [1]:  Vulnerability Details =====================  Class:       Remote Information Disclosure Versions:    2.19.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,              3.7 to 3.7.2 Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3 Description: An unprivileged user is normally not allowed to view              other users' group membership. But boolean charts              let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly              disclosing group membership. This security fix              restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user              belongs to. References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=417048> CVE Number:  [CVE-2010-2756](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2756)  Class:       Notification Bypass Versions:    2.22rc1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,              3.7 to 3.7.2 Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3 Description: Normally, when a user is impersonated, he receives              an email informing him that he is being impersonated,              containing the identity of the impersonator. However,              it was possible to impersonate a user without this              notification being sent. References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=450013> CVE Number:  [CVE-2010-2757](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2757)  Class:       Remote Information Disclosure Versions:    2.17.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,              3.7 to 3.7.2 Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3 Description: An error message thrown by the "Reports" and "Duplicates"              page confirmed the non-existence of products, thus              allowing users to guess confidential product names.              (Note that the "Duplicates" page was not vulnerable              in Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and above though.) References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=577139>              <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519835> CVE Number:  [CVE-2010-2758](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2758)  Class:       Denial of Service Versions:    2.23.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,              3.7 to 3.7.2 Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3 Description: If a comment contained the phrases "bug X" or              "attachment X", where X was an integer larger than the              maximum 32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would              throw an error, and any page containing that comment would              not be viewable. On most Bugzillas, any user can enter              a comment on any bug, so any user could have used this to              deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas running on              databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected.

Confirmed. MySQL silently returns no result while Pg throws the error reported in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=583690#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY][PostgreSQL] Bugzilla crashes when viewing a bug if a comment contains 'bug <num>' or 'attachment <num>' where <num> is greater than the max allowed integer") (no idea about Oracle). This problem is also visible for attachment IDs being too large. You could use this trick to prevent access to all bug reports as you could comment in all bugs, making Bugzilla to crash every time you try to access a bug.Assignee: create-and-change → LpSolitGroup: bugzilla-securityStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: trueFlags: blocking4.0+Flags: blocking3.6.2+Flags: blocking3.4.8+Flags: blocking3.2.8+OS: Windows Vista → AllHardware: x86 → AllSummary: Crash if I type 'bug 4294967296' in comments for bug → [SECURITY][PostgreSQL] Bugzilla crashes when viewing a bug if a comment contains 'bug <num>' or 'attachment <num>' where <num> is greater than the max allowed integerTarget Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 3.2Version: unspecified → 3.6.1

Attached patch

[patch for 3.6 - 4.1, v1](attachment.cgi?id=462035&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=462035&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=583690&attachment=462035)

Technically, the constant could be named MAX\_INTEGER as Pg makes no distinction between INT3 (mediumint) and INT4 (integer) types. If we rename it MAX\_INTEGER, then it could go as a constant in Constants.pm, with value 2147483647, as it would be the same for both MySQL and PostgreSQL (I think Oracle doesn't care), and MySQL won't crash with a number between 8388607 and 2147483647.

(In reply to [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=583690#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY][PostgreSQL] Bugzilla crashes when viewing a bug if a comment contains 'bug <num>' or 'attachment <num>' where <num> is greater than the max allowed integer"))
> May be this error must be processed in contructor of "Bugzilla::Bug" class?
Well, all places where an ID is passed to the new() method, not only Bugzilla::Bug, but also Bugzilla::Group, Bugzilla::User, etc... could be concerned by this problem. We could put a single check in Bugzilla::Object->new(), but the problem would be to know what to do when a too large integer is passed. Throw an error or fail silently? In the problem described in this bug, you don't want to throw an error, while in some other cases, such as the one you mentioned in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=583690#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY][PostgreSQL] Bugzilla crashes when viewing a bug if a comment contains 'bug <num>' or 'attachment <num>' where <num> is greater than the max allowed integer"), it may be fine to throw an error telling the user that the ID is too large. But that's definitely out of the scope of this bug.

One more thing: the testcase you describe in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=583690#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY][PostgreSQL] Bugzilla crashes when viewing a bug if a comment contains 'bug <num>' or 'attachment <num>' where <num> is greater than the max allowed integer") cannot be used to "DoS" Bugzilla, while you can with the testcase described in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=583690#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY][PostgreSQL] Bugzilla crashes when viewing a bug if a comment contains 'bug <num>' or 'attachment <num>' where <num> is greater than the max allowed integer") (which is why I marked it as a security bug).

Ок. But constructor of bug class already have some checking code. And if you try to request bug with invalid or float point id you will get error
----
# Aliases are off, and we got something that's not a number.
my $error\_self = {};
bless $error\_self, $class;
$error\_self->{'bug\_id'} = $param;
$error\_self->{'error'} = 'InvalidBugId';
return $error\_self;

patch for 3.6 - 4.1, v1.1
The check needs to go into Bugzilla::Object->new, I'm pretty sure (at least on trunk). Perhaps for the branches, it should just go into Bugzilla::Bug->new and Bugzilla::Attachment->new.

Also, I think we should target this for 3.6.3 instead--we already have too many security bugs going into 3.6.2.

Also, I suspect this only happens on Pg 8.3 and higher.

Also, new() should return undef in this case--that's what it normally does for invalid values. Just act like somebody asked for an object that doesn't exist.
new\_from\_list should just remove those values from the input list before running the SQL.

patch for 3.6 - 4.1, v1.1
No, as I said, this bug is not about fixing new(). We don't want to throw an error, but simply return the string which was passed. Fixing new() is another bug. Also, we should take it for 3.6.2. It's safe and non-invasive.

Also, fixing new() may have unexpected side-effects I don't want for older branches.

Well, I get what you're saying. However, fixing new() won't have any unexpected side effects. The behavior of "new" is to return "undef" when given an id that does not exist. Since ids greater than the integer maximum can't possibly exist in the database, you are simply correctly returning "undef" for an object that doesn't exist.

Also, since only Pg has the problem, I agree that just having a MAX\_INT constant would be fine. Maybe MAX\_INT\_32 would be the most appropriate name, since it's a 32-bit integer. We could just check things against the MAX\_INT constant.

Although yes, for the branches it's hard to say if you'd run into funny things having to do with invalid input--perhaps we should only check it once we've verified that it's an integer (which I suppose we already do, in new()).

Fix new() and new\_from\_list(). check() calls new(), so it's automatically fixed too.

patch for 3.6-4.1, v2
This looks good. The Object changes I feel pretty confident about and I think they can go on the branches.
I'm a little nervous about modifying get\_attachment\_link on the 3.6 branch or any earlier. When did we actually start supporting Pg 8.3--I think it was 3.6, yeah? Maybe it was 3.4. Not sure.

Mmm, I don't know the performance impact of getting an object (even though it's probably not big), and it seems like a lot of code being changed in a somewhat-critical area.
For the branches I think we should just put the "if $id > MAX\_INT\_32" thing inside of get\_attachment\_link--that's a smaller change that accomplishes the same thing, no?

Oh, there is no impact for 3.4 and newer, as I refactored Attachment.pm to use Object.pm, see [bug 388251](/show_bug.cgi?id=388251 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement 'new Bugzilla::Attachment'"). So you also have a single SQL query. For 3.2, we still use Bugzilla::Attachment->get(), but even there, it's a single SQL query.

Also, does Bugzilla 3.2 even support Pg 8.3? I don't think it does. And this problem almost surely won't happen on any Pg before 8.3.

Sure it does. I'm running QA tests using Pg 8.4.4 on all branches, including 3.2.

Okay. Well, I'd be more comfortable with a smaller patch for the branches, which would probably also be good since then one patch would apply to all of them, most likely.

No reason not to take it there, as we are going to support this branch for a long time, and using an attachment object here is going to save a lot of trouble in the future.
For 3.4 and 3.2, I will attach another patch which doesn't use the attachment object, to minimize changes in Template.pm.Flags: approval3.6?

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=583690&attachment=462372)

The patch for 4.1 doesn't apply to 3.4 as get\_bug\_link() was not using a bug object but calls the DB directly. So I had to write another patch for it anyway, which also applies to 3.2, and works.

Fun, Bugzilla 2.20.7 and 2.22.7 work fine with Pg 8.4.4, and are not vulnerable to this bug, because GetBugLink() in globals.pl injected the bug ID and the attachment ID directly in the SQL queries, without placeholders. But Bugzilla 2.23.1 is vulnerable as we removed globals.pl and started using placeholders everywhere.Version: 3.6.1 → 2.23.1

Looks good. :-) I think the plan to do this one on 3.4 + 3.2 and the above patch on the rest is a good plan.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* It was possible to (at least partially) determine the membership
  of any group using the Search interface.

* It was possible to use the 'sudo' feature without sending
  a notification to the user being impersonated.

* The 'Reports' and 'Duplicates' pages let you guess the name of
  products you could not see, due to the error message that was
  thrown.

* For installations using PostgreSQL, specifying "bug X" or
  "attachment X" in a comment would deny access to the bug if X was
  larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer size.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Remote Information Disclosure
Affected:    2.19.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: An unprivileged user is normally not allowed to view
             other users' group membership. But boolean charts
             let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly
             disclosing group membership. This security fix
             restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user
             belongs to.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2756

Class:       Notification Bypass
Affected:    2.22rc1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: Normally, when a user is impersonated, he receives
             an email informing him that he is being impersonated,
             containing the identity of the impersonator. However,
             it was possible to impersonate a user without this
             notification being sent.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2757

Class:       Remote Information Disclosure
Affected:    2.17.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: An error message thrown by the "Reports" and "Duplicates"
             page confirmed the non-existence of products, thus
             allowing users to guess confidential product names.
             (Note that the "Duplicates" page was not vulnerable
             in Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and above though.)

             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519835
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2758

Class:       Denial of Service
Affected:    2.23.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: If a comment contained the phrases "bug X" or
             "attachment X", where X was an integer larger than the
             maximum 32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would
             throw an error, and any page containing that comment would
             not be viewable. On most Bugzillas, any user can enter
             a comment on any bug, so any user could have used this to
             deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas running on
             databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected.
