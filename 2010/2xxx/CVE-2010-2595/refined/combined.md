How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  An invalid td_stripbytecount field is not properly handle and can trigger a
  NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2010-2595
  An array index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input." in the
  TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function causes an unexpected crash.

CVE-2010-2597
  Also related to "downsampled OJPEG input", the TIFFVStripSize function crash
  unexpectly.

CVE-2010-2630
  The TIFFReadDirectory function does not properly validate the data types of
  codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in a TIFF file.

CVE-2010-4665
  The tiffdump utility has an integer overflow in the ReadDirectory function.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This seems to crash at least EL3 and EL4 64bit versions, though crashes don't seem related.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c12)  Tom Lane    2010-06-15 13:22:35 UTC  ``` What I've been testing is builds of the older libtiff versions on my F-11 workstation, so there might be some small discrepancies from what you see on "real" EL3/4.  I did not see crashes from this particular test case on the older branches, but that doesn't mean they couldn't happen given other circumstances.  A large fraction of the other open libtiff bugs *do* crash the older builds for me.  My feeling is that the most prudent thing to do is apply as many of the 3.9.2 fixes to the older branches as can be made to fit.  In this particular case I found that the #2207 patch doesn't seem to be needed in EL4 but the #2208 one does.  Didn't look at the EL3 code yet.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-16 09:35:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c12)) > What I've been testing is builds of the older libtiff versions on my F-11 > workstation, so there might be some small discrepancies from what you see on > "real" EL3/4.  I did not see crashes from this particular test case on the > older branches, but that doesn't mean they couldn't happen given other > circumstances.  I did try EL4 libtiff built on F-12 x86_64 and it does not crash on this file, while real EL4 x86_64 dies on divide by zero.  It happens in TIFFVStripSize due to what seems to be a different compiler optimization wrt ycbcrsubsampling[2] array.  On real EL4, values are only stored in registers, while F-12 build uses memory.  TIFFGetField is called, but it does not change ycbcrsubsampling as TIFFFieldSet returns 0.  Hence following code uses whatever ycbcrsubsampling was initialized with, possibly 0 that leads to SIGPIPE in TIFFroundup calls.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-16 12:10:05 UTC  ``` Even stranger on EL3 x86_64:  Starting program: /usr/bin/tiff2rgba [bz583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")-test2.tif /dev/null [bz583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")-test2.tif: Warning, unknown field with tag 513 (0x201) ignored.

However, I do see assorted crashes on the test files of other open libtiff bugs.  Your description sounds like this particular problem might be associated with a read of uninitialized memory, so maybe the lack of reproducibility isn't so surprising.  With the 603703 patch and some other patches I've been working on for the other issues, I get no crashes on EL4.  The EL3 case looks really odd though ... what I would expect to get is "Sorry, requested compression method is not configured" followed by exit(1), but it looks like it's trying to plow ahead anyway ...   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c17)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:32 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c18)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c19)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:15:06 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c20)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-24 16:29:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

Fedora  has stopped maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 14. It is  Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no  longer maintained.  At this time, all open bugs with a Fedora 'version' of '14' have been closed as WONTFIX.  (Please note: Our normal process is to give advanced warning of this  occurring, but we forgot to do that. A thousand apologies.)  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, feel free to reopen  this bug and simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we were unable to fix it before Fedora 14 reached end of life. If you  would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged to click on  "Clone This Bug" (top right of this page) and open it against that  version of Fedora.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.  The process we are following is described here:  <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ``` |  |

The problem is that the ReferenceBlackWhite values are out of the range the code is expecting, leading to values put into the various Cb_b_tab[] etc arrays that are also wildly out of range, leading to crashing while trying to index clamptab[].  I am not sure whether the file's values for ReferenceBlackWhite should be considered valid; maybe there is a bug in the way libtiff is processing/interpreting them.  However, what I'm on about right now is not crashing on a file containing bogus values.  I suggest that the safest thing is to abandon clamptab[] altogether and just use the CLAMP macro, as in the attached minimal patch.  It's not clear that the array indexing is even saving anything, and if we can't put a sure limit on the range of the input values we may as well not bother with it.  I didn't go so far as to remove the array from the data structure altogether, but that would be a reasonable further change. ```  ------- *Comment [#1](show_bug.cgi?id=2208#c1) From Even Rouault  2010-10-18 15:54:45* ------- ``` *** [Bug 2240](show_bug.cgi?id=2240 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Invalid read at TIFFYCbCrtoRGB (tif_color.c:189)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  ------- *Comment [#2](show_bug.cgi?id=2208#c2) From Even Rouault  2010-10-18 15:57:48* ------- ``` Was also reported as [http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2240](show_bug.cgi?id=2240 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Invalid read at TIFFYCbCrtoRGB (tif_color.c:189)") and reproducable with <http://alt.swiecki.net/j/t/ycbcrtorgb.tif>  Has been assigned to <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2595>  Fixed in downstream releases : <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=libtiff.git;a=blob;f=libtiff-ycbcr-clamp.patch;h=fbd10bb576a19c49936c2e5b67ff0177211c230b;hb=8a8bf6704497c5165ec5233eb1b8ce8992173d94> ```  ------- *Comment [#3](show_bug.cgi?id=2208#c3) From Lee Howard  2010-12-13 21:23:27* ------- ``` Thanks.

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF 4.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.2-r1"

```

All libTIFF 3.9 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.9.5-r2"

```

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
