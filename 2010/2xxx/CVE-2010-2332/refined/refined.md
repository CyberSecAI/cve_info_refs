Based on the provided exploit-db entry, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2332

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how the Impact PDF Reader application handles POST requests. Specifically, it appears that the application does not properly process or validate the content length or the request body when receiving POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of proper input validation:** The application fails to check or handle invalid or short Content-Length values within POST requests, specifically when the actual request body is different than what the header claims.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted POST request with a small `Content-Length` value but a different body (`...`), an attacker can trigger a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit results in the Impact PDF Reader application becoming unresponsive and unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a malicious POST request to the application's listening port.
*   **Network-based:** The exploit requires the attacker to send network packets to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the device running the vulnerable application.
*   **Socket programming skills:** The attacker needs basic skills in network socket programming to send the crafted malicious POST request.
*   **Knowledge of the targeted application's listening port:**  The attacker needs to know what TCP port the Impact PDF Reader is listening on.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
* The exploit-db entry provides a python script which can be used to trigger the denial of service.
* The entry mentions the vulnerable versions: 2.0 and 1.2
* The entry specifies the affected platform iOS.
* The entry indicates that the vulnerability was tested on an iPod 2G with iOS 3.1.3
