These two appear to be about "not filtering src/ or hooks/ from pathnames"

Use CVE-2010-2447
```

```
gitolite before 1.4.1 does not filter src/ or hooks/ from path names.
```

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The gitolite application did not properly filter path names during the checkout process, allowing the inclusion of `src/` or `hooks/` directories in the work tree.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation and path sanitization, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially inject malicious code or configuration within the `src/` or `hooks/` directories, which could be executed within the gitolite environment, compromising the integrity and security of the git repository management.
*  **Attack vectors**: An attacker with administrative access to gitolite could create or modify files and directories, including `src/` and `hooks/` in the gitolite-admin repository, which could then be deployed to the gitolite environment.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have write access to the gitolite-admin repository.
