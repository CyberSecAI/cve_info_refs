  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2010-2693",
      "root_cause": "The read-only flag of an mbuf is not correctly copied when a mbuf buffer reference is duplicated.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of the read-only flag during mbuf duplication."
      ],
       "impact": "Data corruption, leading to potential privilege escalation by local attackers through controlled corruption of system files. Any file the attacker has read access to can be corrupted.",

        "Local access",

        "Local user access.",
