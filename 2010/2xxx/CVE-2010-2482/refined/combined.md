How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Not really a reference for the issue, but at least for the patch:
<http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2210>

This changelog entry refers to td_stripoffset issue (aka CVE-2010-2443)
and it first appears in 3.9.3 changelog.  td_stripbytecount case is not
yet fixed upstream as far as I can tell.

This seems to be crashing on buffer over-read in putcontig8bitYCbCr11tile(). gtTileContig() allocates buffer buf with size returned by TIFFTileSize() (80640 in this case). putcontig8bitYCbCr11tile() tries to read w\*h\*3 bytes out of it (234\*213\*3 = 149526 in this case).

This was mailed upstream, but they don't seem to treat is as much of a priority as it should not affect 4.0-beta. I've CCed you on rhbz#603081 which has a proposed patch.

I'll refer it to Joris in case he wants to address it.  I'm not touching it further!

In this case, I've sofar found that following the  JpegInterchangeFormat tag as the primary and mostly reliable source of JPEG  compressed information is sufficient to resolve the situation. Hence, the  OJPEG-specific hack in TIFFReadDirectory that makes sure no fatal error is  thrown complaining about the situation:   if (!TIFFFieldSet(tif, FIELD_STRIPOFFSETS)) {   if ((tif->tif_dir.td_compression==COMPRESSION_OJPEG) &&       (isTiled(tif)==0) &&       (tif->tif_dir.td_nstrips==1)) {    /*     * XXX: OJPEG hack.     * If a) compression is OJPEG, b) it's not a tiled TIFF,     * and c) the number of strips is 1,     * then we tolerate the absence of stripoffsets tag,     * because, presumably, all required data is in the     * JpegInterchangeFormat stream.     */    TIFFSetFieldBit(tif, FIELD_STRIPOFFSETS);   } else {    MissingRequired(tif,     isTiled(tif) ? "TileOffsets" : "StripOffsets");    goto bad;   }  }  The code above works only for strips. The file in the bugreport is missing  the TileByteCounts tag, actually, as it's pseudo-tiled. However, it turns  out that LibTiff doesn't actually check the presence of the ByteCounts tag  at all for tiled TIFFs, resulting in much the same behaviour. This might  cause other codecs to blow up with a NULL dereferencing too, and we should  check this out, keeping in mind that there's much naming confusion in  LibTiff where stuff with 'strip' in its name is reused for tiles and the  other way around. But for OJPEG it is unintentionally proper behaviour:  there's nothing to OJPEG-specifically forgive here because the problem goes  undetected independently of the compression scheme, though I'm not quite  sure at this stage why or how nor how to cure it.  Inside the OJPEG decoder, following the JpegInterchangeFormat tag as primary  source of information doesn't work in this case, as the tag is absent. Thus,  the OJPEG decoder next tries to access the first strile (=strip or tile)  trying to find the required information. This is where things blow up, the  code incorrectly relies on the presence of a bytecounts array, and it's  absent, thus dereferencing NULL.  The safe cure is to test for the presence of a bytecounts array, and if it's  not fall back on the same robust bytecount that is used when the bytecount  that is present is totally out of range. In other words, inside  OJPEGReadBufferFill in tif_ojpeg.c, near the bottom of that procedure,  change the handling of the osibsStrile source case like this:     case osibsStrile:     if (sp->in_buffer_next_strile==sp->in_buffer_strile_count)      sp->in_buffer_source=osibsEof;     else     {      sp->in_buffer_file_pos=sp->tif->tif_dir.td_stripoffset[sp->in_buffer_next_strile];      if (sp->in_buffer_file_pos!=0)      {       if (sp->in_buffer_file_pos>=sp->file_size)        sp->in_buffer_file_pos=0;       else if (sp->tif->tif_dir.td_stripbytecount==NULL)        sp->in_buffer_file_togo=sp->file_size-sp->in_buffer_file_pos;       else       {        sp->in_buffer_file_togo=sp->tif->tif_dir.td_stripbytecount[sp->in_buffer_next_strile];        if (sp->in_buffer_file_togo==0)         sp->in_buffer_file_pos=0;        else if  (sp->in_buffer_file_pos+sp->in_buffer_file_togo>sp->file_size)         sp->in_buffer_file_togo=sp->file_size-sp->in_buffer_file_pos;       }      }      sp->in_buffer_next_strile++;     }     break;  The file this way decodes and renders fine.  This was a mistake of mine, I hadn't thought of this situation and it  resulted in a bad failure. I don't have CVS set up right now, so I hope  someone will urgently apply the fix for me.  Frank, I humbly dissagree with your assessment as to the safety of the OJPEG decoder. It's probably had fewer problems then any other subcodec, and certainly is less vulnerable then the encapsulating LibTiff package, even if the format itself is very troublesome to say the least. My code isn't scary as it is properly designed, carefully written, and checks everything except what is fed directly to the reliable LibJpeg. It may seem complicated, but working around so many issues with so many mutually exclusive interpretations of a buggy specification is a complicated matter. ```  ------- *Comment [#5](show_bug.cgi?id=1996#c5) From Richard Nolde  2009-09-18 04:29:34* ------- ``` I can toggle whether tiffcrop will seg fault on NEW  COMPRESSION_JPEG images by modifying the value in the following line when the image is read.  if (input_compression == COMPRESSION_JPEG)     TIFFSetField(in, TIFFTAG_JPEGCOLORMODE, JPEGCOLORMODE_RGB);  Setting this pseudotag to JPEGCOLORMODE_RGB works fine on NEW JPEG with libjpeg7 and is the default for tiffcp.  Change it to JPEGCOLORMODE_RAW and you get a segfault. If the input file uses COMPRESSION_OJPEG, it has no effect on the segfault.  Richard ```  ------- *Comment [#6](show_bug.cgi?id=1996#c6) From Richard Nolde  2009-09-18 18:07:00* ------- ``` I've narrowed down the problem a little more.  For OJPEG images, TIFFStripSize, and TIFFScanlineSize are returning HALF the values that they should and TIFFReadEncodedStrip is using those values to retrieve the contents of the strip even if you ask for additional bytes, ie, the correct number of bytes that should come back from decompressing the strip. So even though I ask for the correct amount of data, I'm only getting half of it back for OJPEG images.  I'm rebuilding libtiff with debug support so I can walk into the routines called by TIFFReadEncodedStrip and see what is actually happening.  The default build optimizes away all the stuff I need to look at.

Here is what I found.  With smallliz.tif, I get the attached images as described below where smallliz-njpeg tries to convert from OJPEG to NEW JPEG after reading the image into memory and stepping through the debugger to alter the size of the data request.  The auto version is what I get if I just run tiffcrop without tweaking the size of the data request which will then attempt to convert OJPEG to NEW JPEG on the fly.  If I use -cnone, the output should be uncompressed data.  Surprisingly, this works just fine for zackthecat which is also OJPEG format.  For the OJPEG images in libtiffpic at least, TIFFVStripsize is returning half of the expected size, which in this case is the size of the subsampled data, not the size required to store the data as reconstructed and decompressed into width * length * spp * bps / 8. In the debugger, I manually reset the size of the stripsize and passed the larger value to OJPEGDecodeRaw.  Surprisingly, it did not error out or seg fault and it returned the full number of bytes I asked for as I stepped through it loop by loop.  Then I wrote out the full buffer in NEW JPEG format without errors.  The results fill the frame but it is clear that the second half consists of repetitions of the final rows of the upper half whereas the previous result was a black lower half since the write buffer was initialized before copying the input data to it.  TIFFVStripSize64 returns the smaller value with a special check for YCbCr based on the subsampling values, which I have to assume are correct for the file as I don't know enough to test otherwise.  But as you say, since YCbCr does not automatically imply JPEG, we cannot adjust those values unless we test the compression in that routine (and all similar routines) and know enough to make an informed choice of what should be returned. As I noted above, the application cannot compensate unless it wants to read RAW strips and even then I am not sure how it would know how much data to ask for since TIFFStripSize is the first problem.  Another possibility is that the smaller value is the correct amount of data, but it is not being decoded and expanded properly.  Perhaps we are seeing the raw subsampled data presented as though it were already decompressed. I stepped through the OJPEGDecodeRaw routine with the larger value for the return buffer size but I don't know enough about the operations of the libjpeg calls to know if actual decoded is being done.  I'll post the images to Bugzilla in the hopes that a JPEG guru might see them and recognize what is going on here.  There are clearly two issues though.  One is that tiffcp is now broken for OJPEG images completely with libjpeg7 at least, and the other is that other applications that use libtiff may break with libjpeg7.  I will try to setup a parallel universe with libjpeg62b and see if it is dependent on the version of libjpeg that is being run.  Thanks for your help again.  Richard ```  ------- *Comment [#11](show_bug.cgi?id=1996#c11) From Bob Friesenhahn  2010-06-08 20:56:29* ------- ``` It seems that today I "cured" the crash by checking if sp->tif->tif_dir.td_stripoffset is null and throwing an error and error code if it is.  From Joris's description, my cure was the wrong solution, even though it avoids a crash. ```  ------- *Comment [#12](show_bug.cgi?id=1996#c12) From Tom Lane  2010-06-22 12:34:03* ------- ``` In the discussion of this problem at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=603024>, Tomas Hoger pointed out that the code also assumes td_stripbytecount isn't null, just below where Bob patched it.  Experimentation with a test file for this case shows that tiffsplit.c is also a bit unwary about missing bytecounts.  Attached patch stops both core dumps, though I'm not sure if this is exactly the direction you want to go in. ```  ------- *Comment [#13](show_bug.cgi?id=1996#c13) From Tom Lane  2010-06-22 12:34:52* ------- ``` [Created an attachment (id=397)](attachment.cgi?id=397 "patch for tif_ojpeg.c and tiffsplit.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=397&action=edit "patch for tif_ojpeg.c and tiffsplit.c") patch for tif_ojpeg.c and tiffsplit.c ```  ------- *Comment [#14](show_bug.cgi?id=1996#c14) From Lee Howard  2010-12-11 15:01:24* ------- ``` I've committed the patches by both Joris and Tom to CVS HEAD and 3.9 branches.  One patch handled a NULL case and one handled an == 0 case, so I'm not sure if one makes the other unnecessary, but having both cases handled doesn't hurt anything.  As for the other problem reported by Richard (where the returned strip size is half of what is correct), I suspect that this had to do with a byte-counts being typed incorrectly as uint32* when it now (in HEAD/4.0) is uint64*.  I've scoured the libtiff source for any cases where TIFFGetField is called for TIFFTAG_STRIPBYTECOUNTS or TIFFTAG_TILEBYTECOUNTS to see if any of them were still using uint32*.  I did find one case in tools/tiffinfoce.c, and I've fixed that now, but I didn't find any others.  I suppose that the resulting data is being mishandled somewhere, but I didn't take the time to examine that (because I think it's unlikely).  I wonder if this is something that has been fixed in the past year-plus.  I've compared tiffdump output on the referenced OJPEG images between 3.9 and 4.0, and the strip sizes are being reported identical between them, so I suspect that this has been fixed at some earlier time.  Richard, if you wouldn't mind re-testing with current CVS HEAD, and if the problem still exists reopen this or create a new report.  Please describe the exact method to reproduce and detect the fault. ``` |

This seems to be crashing on buffer over-read in putcontig8bitYCbCr11tile(). gtTileContig() allocates buffer buf with size returned by TIFFTileSize() (80640 in this case). putcontig8bitYCbCr11tile() tries to read w\*h\*3 bytes out of it (234\*213\*3 = 149526 in this case).

This was mailed upstream, but they don't seem to treat is as much of a priority as it should not affect 4.0-beta. I've CCed you on rhbz#603081 which has a proposed patch.

Yeah, similar to [bug #589145](/bugs/589145), now with NULL td\_stripbytecount instead of td\_stripoffset.

Do you have any info on this?  I don't see anything obviously related
in changelog.  TIFFExtractData itself and all its uses seem unchanged
for years.

This is NULL deref.  Another Sauli's test case shows that similar
problem can occur with NULL td_stripbytecount few lines below
td_stripoffset case addressed in upstream patch.

Right, not related to what CVE-2010-2065 was assigned to.

IIRC, Sauli's file only demonstrates OOB read.  Upstream bug:
<http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2216>

> 4.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2207> ("tif_getimage

CVE-2010-2233 was assigned to this issue.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Debian Bug     : 678140

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Tiff, a library set and tools
to support the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), allowing denial of service and
potential privilege escalation.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited via a specially crafted TIFF image.

CVE-2012-2113
  The tiff2pdf utility has an integer overflow error when parsing images.

CVE-2012-3401
  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala discovered heap-based buffer overflow in the
  t2p_read_tiff_init() function.

CVE-2010-2482
  An invalid td_stripbytecount field is not properly handle and can trigger a
  NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2010-2595
  An array index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input." in the
  TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function causes an unexpected crash.

CVE-2010-2597
  Also related to "downsampled OJPEG input", the TIFFVStripSize function crash
  unexpectly.

CVE-2010-2630
  The TIFFReadDirectory function does not properly validate the data types of
  codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in a TIFF file.

CVE-2010-4665
  The tiffdump utility has an integer overflow in the ReadDirectory function.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
