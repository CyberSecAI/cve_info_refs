Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2091

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) version 8.2.254.0 handles the "id" parameter within URL requests. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided through the "id" parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content via the "id" parameter.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The provided exploit examples demonstrate the potential for XSS. By injecting Javascript code within the "id" parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of a user's browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to potentially sensitive information by manipulating the "id" parameter or executing arbitrary code.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (via XSS):** By injecting malicious Javascript, an attacker can perform actions within the user's session, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to other sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes a payload in the "id" parameter.
- **Web Browser:** The attack is executed when a victim accesses the crafted URL through their web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OWA server.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute URLs containing the malicious payload in the id parameter.
- **User Interaction (for XSS):** To execute XSS, a user must click on the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit examples show the potential for inserting `<script>` tags, leading to XSS.
- The content explicitly identifies the vulnerable application as "Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) version 8.2.254.0" on Windows Server 2003 with Internet Explorer 7.
- This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts by crafting a malicious URL, indicating a lack of proper input sanitization for the "id" parameter.
