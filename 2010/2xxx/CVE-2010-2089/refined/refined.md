    "content": "The audioop module in Python 2.7 and 3.2 does not verify the relationships between size arguments and byte string lengths, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via crafted arguments, as demonstrated by a call to audioop.reverse with a one-byte string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-1634.\n\n- a race condition in the accept() implementation of smtpd.py could lead to a denial of service (CVE-2010-3493).\n- integer overflows and insufficient size checks could crash the audioop and rgbimg modules (CVE-2010-2089, CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2009-4134,CVE-2010-1449,CVE-2010-1450).\n\nIt was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash.\n\nIt was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash. (CVE-2010-1634, CVE-2010-2089)",
    "root_cause": "The audioop module in Python does not validate if the length of the input byte string is a multiple of the sample size. This can lead to out-of-bounds reads and writes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds memory access",
        "Integer overflows"

    "required_capabilities": "Ability to provide crafted input to the audioop module. No special privileges required.",
        "additonal_details":"The vulnerability can be triggered by a call to functions like audioop.reverse, when the length of the input byte string is not a multiple of sample size.  The vulnerability also includes integer overflows and insufficient size checks, which could crash the audioop and rgbimg modules."
