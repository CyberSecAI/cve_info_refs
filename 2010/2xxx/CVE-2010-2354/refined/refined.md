Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **CVE IDs:** CVE-2010-2354, CVE-2010-2355, CVE-2010-2356
*   **Software:** eLMS Pro
*   **Vulnerability Types:** SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `subscribe.php` script, specifically the `course_id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting:** The application fails to properly sanitize user supplied input within the `subscribe.php` script, specifically the `course_id` parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `course_id` parameter within the `subscribe.php` script, before using it in SQL queries or outputting it to the web page. This allows for both SQL injection and XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials, personal information, or course content.
    *   The attacker might be able to modify or delete data, potentially leading to data corruption or denial of service.
    *   The attacker could potentially escalate privileges within the application or even gain access to the underlying system, depending on database permissions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   These scripts could steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface web pages.
    *   XSS can lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, and unauthorized actions performed in the context of a victim's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `course_id` parameter in the `subscribe.php` URL.  Example: `http://[site]/subscribe.php?course_id=[sqli]`
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts via the `course_id` parameter in the `subscribe.php` URL. Example: `http://[site]/subscribe.php?course_id=[XSS]`. The exploit pattern provided is `'"-->`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable eLMS Pro instance.
*   **Basic Web Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Notes**

* The exploit-db entry indicates that the vulnerability was identified and disclosed by `Sid3^effects` on June 9th, 2010.
* The exploit-db entry states "0day no more", suggesting it was a zero-day exploit at the time of discovery, now public.
* The eLMS Pro is a learning management system used for education formations.
* The entry also states that this vulnerability affects the PHP platform, which the eLMS Pro is built on.
* The vulnerability affects the `subscribe.php` endpoint.
