    "ExtractedDetails": {
      "RootCause": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw in Quagga's bgpd daemon when parsing paths of autonomous systems (AS). Specifically, the daemon doesn't handle unknown AS types correctly.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service (bgpd daemon crash). In some configurations, crafted AS paths could be relayed by intermediate BGP routers.",
      "AttackVectors": [
        "A configured BGP peer could send a BGP update AS path request with unknown AS type."
      ],
      "AttackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be a configured BGP peer.",
     "AdditionalDetail": "Some sources also indicate that malformed AS-Pathlimit or Extended-Community attributes could also lead to Denial of Service (daemon crash)."
