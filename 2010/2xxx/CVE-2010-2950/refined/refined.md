Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a format string vulnerability in the `phar_stream_flush` function within the `stream.c` file of the PHP `phar` extension. This vulnerability arises due to an incomplete fix for a related issue (CVE-2010-2094).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability**: The `phar_stream_flush` function does not properly handle a crafted `phar://` URI, leading to a format string vulnerability. Specifically, the function uses a user-controlled string as a format string argument, allowing for control over what is printed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information (memory contents) by crafting a specific format string within the `phar://` URI.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some contexts, the attacker might be able to gain arbitrary code execution by crafting a carefully crafted format string that manipulates memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly stated as an impact, the information disclosure could lead to a DoS via application crash

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who can influence the parameters of the `phar://` URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted input that influences the `phar://` URI processed by PHP.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can potentially be exploited without authentication depending on how the vulnerable code is used.
*   **Moderate Complexity:** Exploitation requires some understanding of format string vulnerabilities and PHP's `phar` extension to craft the necessary URI.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically located in the `phar_stream_flush` function.
*   The vulnerability was present in PHP versions 5.3.x through 5.3.3 and was fixed in 5.3.4.
*   The vulnerability is also related to other format string vulnerabilities in the `phar` extension, namely CVE-2010-2094, CVE-2010-0397, CVE-2010-0743
*   The vulnerability is tracked as MOPS-2010-024
*   The vulnerability was fixed in PHP with commit [http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=302565](http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=302565).
*   The issue was first attempted to be fixed with a commit [http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=298667](http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=298667), but that fix was incomplete.

**Affected Products:**
*   openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
*   SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1
*   PHP 5.3.x through 5.3.3
