Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Shareasale Script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `merchant_id` parameter within the `merchant_product_list.php` file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data. This could include user credentials, product information, and other confidential information.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through a web request by manipulating the `merchant_id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned as being required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry mentions that the vulnerable script is written in PHP 4.0, which is a very old version and is no longer supported.
*   The provided URL `http://server/merchant_product_list.php?merchant_id=[sqli]` demonstrates the attack vector, where `[sqli]` would be replaced by malicious SQL code.
