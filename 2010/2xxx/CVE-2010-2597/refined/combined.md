How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This is not correct; what they actually want is TIFFGetFieldDefaulted, which can be assumed to succeed since there's a place to get the defaults if no such tag was provided by the input file.  I attach a patch that fixes the immediate problem in 3.9.2, but I would suggest a generic review of the code to see if anyplace else needs a similar change.  Or maybe a more radical bit of future-proofing is called for --- should TIFFGetFieldDefaulted even be a separate function, or should TIFFGetField just always return defaults if some exist? ```  ------- *Comment [#1](show_bug.cgi?id=2215#c1) From Lee Howard  2010-12-14 19:51:20* ------- ``` I've committed your patch to the CVS 3.9 branch.  I have not performed a full code audit as suggested, however.  These changes appear to already have been made in CVS HEAD, so they don't apply there.  Thanks. ``` |

I did not see crashes from this particular test case on the older branches, but that doesn't mean they couldn't happen given other circumstances.  A large fraction of the other open libtiff bugs *do* crash the older builds for me.  My feeling is that the most prudent thing to do is apply as many of the 3.9.2 fixes to the older branches as can be made to fit.  In this particular case I found that the #2207 patch doesn't seem to be needed in EL4 but the #2208 one does.  Didn't look at the EL3 code yet.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-16 09:35:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c12)) > What I've been testing is builds of the older libtiff versions on my F-11 > workstation, so there might be some small discrepancies from what you see on > "real" EL3/4.  I did not see crashes from this particular test case on the > older branches, but that doesn't mean they couldn't happen given other > circumstances.  I did try EL4 libtiff built on F-12 x86_64 and it does not crash on this file, while real EL4 x86_64 dies on divide by zero.  It happens in TIFFVStripSize due to what seems to be a different compiler optimization wrt ycbcrsubsampling[2] array.  On real EL4, values are only stored in registers, while F-12 build uses memory.  TIFFGetField is called, but it does not change ycbcrsubsampling as TIFFFieldSet returns 0.  Hence following code uses whatever ycbcrsubsampling was initialized with, possibly 0 that leads to SIGPIPE in TIFFroundup calls.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-16 12:10:05 UTC  ``` Even stranger on EL3 x86_64:  Starting program: /usr/bin/tiff2rgba [bz583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")-test2.tif /dev/null [bz583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")-test2.tif: Warning, unknown field with tag 513 (0x201) ignored.

However, I do see assorted crashes on the test files of other open libtiff bugs.  Your description sounds like this particular problem might be associated with a read of uninitialized memory, so maybe the lack of reproducibility isn't so surprising.  With the 603703 patch and some other patches I've been working on for the other issues, I get no crashes on EL4.  The EL3 case looks really odd though ... what I would expect to get is "Sorry, requested compression method is not configured" followed by exit(1), but it looks like it's trying to plow ahead anyway ...   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c17)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:32 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c18)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c19)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:15:06 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c20)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-24 16:29:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

Fedora  has stopped maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 14. It is  Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no  longer maintained.  At this time, all open bugs with a Fedora 'version' of '14' have been closed as WONTFIX.  (Please note: Our normal process is to give advanced warning of this  occurring, but we forgot to do that. A thousand apologies.)  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, feel free to reopen  this bug and simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we were unable to fix it before Fedora 14 reached end of life. If you  would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged to click on  "Clone This Bug" (top right of this page) and open it against that  version of Fedora.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.  The process we are following is described here:  <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ``` |  |

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF 4.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.2-r1"

```

All libTIFF 3.9 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.9.5-r2"

```

Debian Bug     : 678140

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Tiff, a library set and tools
to support the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), allowing denial of service and
potential privilege escalation.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited via a specially crafted TIFF image.

CVE-2012-2113
  The tiff2pdf utility has an integer overflow error when parsing images.

CVE-2012-3401
  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala discovered heap-based buffer overflow in the
  t2p_read_tiff_init() function.

CVE-2010-2482
  An invalid td_stripbytecount field is not properly handle and can trigger a
  NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2010-2595
  An array index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input." in the
  TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function causes an unexpected crash.

CVE-2010-2597
  Also related to "downsampled OJPEG input", the TIFFVStripSize function crash
  unexpectly.

CVE-2010-2630
  The TIFFReadDirectory function does not properly validate the data types of
  codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in a TIFF file.

CVE-2010-4665
  The tiffdump utility has an integer overflow in the ReadDirectory function.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

But there is a spec-mandated default, and we should fall back on that.  Does the attached patch fix the symptoms you're seeing?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=603703#c6)  Tom Lane    2010-06-14 16:20:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 423895](attachment.cgi?id=423895&action=diff "patch to use defaults properly") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=423895&action=edit "patch to use defaults properly") patch to use defaults properly   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=603703#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-15 08:12:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=603703#c5)) > Does the attached patch fix the symptoms you're seeing?
