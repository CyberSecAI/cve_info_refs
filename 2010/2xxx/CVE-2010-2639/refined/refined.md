- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `RunTimeProfileCacheCmdImpl` class in IBM WebSphere Commerce was caching mutable objects that were modified in other controller/task commands, leading to concurrency issues. This could expose a potential security issue when the outbound messaging system accesses this class.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Concurrency issues due to caching of mutable objects.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The issue may prevent outgoing messages from being sent properly. The specific security exposure is not further described.
- **Attack vectors:** The outbound messaging system accesses the vulnerable class.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to trigger outbound messages in a way that interacts with the vulnerable caching mechanism.
