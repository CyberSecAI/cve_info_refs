# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

I spy three flaws:

    A data leakage vulnerability was discovered, affecting MediaWiki 1.8
    and later. Public caching headers were incorrectly set on API
    responses containing private data. By means of a CSRF-style attack,
    this can lead to the disclosure of various types of private data
    stored on a wiki. All users are advised to upgrade. Full details can
    be found at:

    <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24565>

Use CVE-2010-2787

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in
    profileinfo.php. The vulnerability is only exposed when the script is
    explicitly enabled in LocalSettings.php, with $wgEnableProfileInfo = true.

Use CVE-2010-2788

    A register_globals arbitrary inclusion vulnerability was discovered in
    the 1.16 beta release series, in MediaWikiParserTest.php. This
    vulnerability does not affect any stable MediaWiki release. It only
    affects wikis which have PHP's register_globals feature enabled,
    despite our strong advice to the contrary. Apache installations with
    AllowOverride enabled may be protected against this vulnerability,
    since there is a .htaccess file with "Deny from all" in the relevant path.

Use CVE-2010-2789

Thank.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is a security and bugfix release of MediaWiki 1.16.0 and
MediaWiki 1.15.5. Download links are given at the end of this email.

A data leakage vulnerability was discovered, affecting MediaWiki 1.8
and later. Public caching headers were incorrectly set on API
responses containing private data. By means of a CSRF-style attack,
this can lead to the disclosure of various types of private data
stored on a wiki. All users are advised to upgrade. Full details can
be found at:

<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24565>

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in
profileinfo.php. The vulnerability is only exposed when the script is
explicitly enabled in LocalSettings.php, with $wgEnableProfileInfo = true.

A register_globals arbitrary inclusion vulnerability was discovered in
the 1.16 beta release series, in MediaWikiParserTest.php. This
vulnerability does not affect any stable MediaWiki release. It only
affects wikis which have PHP's register_globals feature enabled,
despite our strong advice to the contrary. Apache installations with
AllowOverride enabled may be protected against this vulnerability,
since there is a .htaccess file with "Deny from all" in the relevant path.

In both releases, the interface text was updated with new translations
from translatewiki.net.

Upgrade FAQ:
[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:FAQ#Upgrading](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual%3AFAQ#Upgrading)

**********************************************************************

We are proud to announce the first stable release of the 1.16 series.
Selected changes that may be of interest since MediaWiki 1.15 are:

* Watchlists now have RSS/Atom feeds. RSS feeds generally are now
hidden, since Atom is a better protocol and is supported by virtually
all clients.

* It's now possible to block users from sending email via
Special:Emailuser.

* The maintenance script system was overhauled. Most maintenance
scripts now have a useful help page when you run them with --help.

* AdminSettings.php is no longer required in order to run maintenance
scripts. You can just set $wgDBadminuser and $wgDBadminpassword in
your LocalSettings.php instead.

* The preferences system was overhauled. Preferences are stored in a
more compact format. Changes to site default preferences will
automatically affect all users who have not chosen a different preference.

* Support for SQLite was improved. Some broken features were fixed,
and it now has an efficient full-text search.

* The user groups ACL system was improved by allowing rights to be
revoked, instead of just granted.

* A new localisation caching system was introduced, which will make
MediaWiki faster for almost everyone, especially when lots of
extensions are enabled.

By default, this new system makes a lot of database queries. If your
database is particularly slow, or if your system administrator limits
your query count, or if you want to squeeze as much performance as
possible out of Mediawiki, set $wgCacheDirectory to a writable path on
the local filesystem. Make sure you have the DBA extension for PHP
installed, this will improve performance further.
