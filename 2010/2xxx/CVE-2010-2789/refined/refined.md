Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the usage of `register_globals`, a PHP feature, in the `MediaWikiParserTest.php` file within the 1.16 beta release series of MediaWiki. This feature, when enabled, allows external variables to overwrite PHP variables, leading to arbitrary file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Arbitrary File Inclusion: With `register_globals` enabled, an attacker can control PHP variables, leading to the ability to include arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By including a malicious file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct HTTP Request: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to a vulnerable MediaWiki installation. This attack is only possible if the php.ini setting `register_globals` is set to `On` and this configuration is highly discouraged.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the MediaWiki server.
- The server's PHP configuration must have `register_globals` enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the 1.16 beta releases of MediaWiki and does not affect stable releases.
- The risk of exploitation is reduced as MediaWiki strongly advises against enabling `register_globals`.
- Apache installations with `AllowOverride` enabled might be protected due to a `.htaccess` file that denies access to the relevant path.
