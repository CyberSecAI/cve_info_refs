Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2931

**Vulnerable Software:** SigPlus Pro v3.74 ActiveX control

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `LCDWriteString()` method of the SigPlus Pro ActiveX control. It is caused by a buffer overflow in the ActiveX control when handling long strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `LCDWriteString()` method does not properly validate the length of the input string, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Lack of input validation:** The ActiveX control does not validate the size of the input, causing a crash when an overly large string is passed to the vulnerable method

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control of the compromised system.
- **DEP (Data Execution Prevention) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) bypass:** The exploit bypasses DEP and ASLR protections using a JIT spray technique.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted web page.
- **ActiveX Control:** The attack leverages the vulnerable `LCDWriteString()` method of the ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page or inject the malicious code into a legitimate website.
- The victim needs to visit the malicious web page with a vulnerable version of the SigPlus Pro ActiveX control installed.
- The victim needs to have a vulnerable version of Flash Player installed (<= 10.0.42) for the JIT spray technique to work.

**Technical Details:**

- The exploit uses a JavaScript function `rockAndRoll()` to trigger the buffer overflow in `LCDWriteString()`.
- The exploit sends a long string to the vulnerable method with a crafted SEH overwrite.
- The exploit uses a JIT (Just-In-Time) spray technique with a Flash object to place shellcode in executable memory pages. This technique involves spraying many pages so that the guessed retn address will point to the attacker-controlled shellcode and makes the exploit reliable (working 9/10 times).
- The shellcode executes a bind shell on port 4444, allowing the attacker to connect and control the compromised system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to SigPlus Pro v3.74 ActiveX. Later versions are not vulnerable.
- The exploit specifically targets Internet Explorer versions 7 and 8.
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a full proof-of-concept HTML exploit.
