{
  "cveId": "CVE-2010-2495",
  "description": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the L2TP protocol. When transmitting L2TP frames, the kernel derives the outgoing interface's UDP checksum hardware assist capabilities from the tunnel destination device (dst dev). If the tunnel's dst dev is NULL, especially due to routing protocol changes, a NULL pointer dereference occurs, leading to a system crash.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The kernel does not properly check for a NULL destination device (dst dev) pointer when determining UDP checksum hardware assist capabilities for L2TP frames.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A system crash leading to denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Malicious routing changes that result in a NULL dst dev pointer"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to manipulate routing configurations. This could be local access or an attacker able to manipulate network traffic via routing protocols."
  },
    "additionalDetails": {
    "introducedIn": "ffcebb16 (v2.6.29-rc1~581)",
    "fixedIn": "3feec909 (v2.6.34-rc2)",
        "affectedVersions": [
            "2.6.29-rc1 through 2.6.34-rc1"
        ],
        "notes": "The vulnerability was present in the Linux kernel's L2TP implementation and was resolved by adding checks for NULL dst or dev pointers. The issue could be triggered by routing changes causing a NULL dst dev when transmitting L2TP frames."
