# Ruby 1.9.1-p429 is released

Posted by Yugui on 2 Jul 2010

Ruby 1.9.1-p429 has just been released. This is a patchlevel release for
Ruby 1.9.1. This fixes many bugs and includes the fix for a security
vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute an arbitrary code.

## Vulnerability

### Description

A security vulnerability that causes buffer overflow when you assign a
danger value to `ARGF.inplace_mode` on Windows. It possibly allows an
attacker to execute an arbitrary code.

The affected versions are:

* Ruby 1.9.1 patchlevel 378 and all prior versions;
* Ruby 1.9.2 preview 3 and all prior versions;
* Development versions of Ruby 1.9 (1.9.3dev).

I recommend you to upgrade your ruby 1.9 to 1.9.1-p429 or 1.9.2-rc1.

The vulnerability does not directly affect to Ruby 1.8 series.

### Credit

The vulnerability was found and reported by Masaya TARUI.

Subject: CVE Request [Microsoft Windows Ruby-v1.9.x] -- Buffer over-run leading
 to ACE

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Ruby upstream has released latest v1.9.1-p429, v1.9.2 RC1 versions, addressing one
   security issue, present on Microsoft Windows operating systems, where version of Ruby
   language is v1.9.x based:
     [1] <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2010/07/02/ruby-1-9-1-p429-is-released/>
     [2] <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2010/07/02/ruby-1-9-2-rc1-is-released/>
     [3] <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_9_2_rc1/ChangeLog>

Quoting from [1]:

<begin quote>

A security vulnerability that causes buffer overflow when you assign
a danger value to ARGF.inplace_mode on Windows. It possibly allows an
attacker to execute an arbitrary code.

The affected versions are:

     * Ruby 1.9.1 patchlevel 378 and all prior versions.
     * Ruby 1.9.2 preview 3 and all prior versions.
     * Development versions of Ruby 1.9 (1.9.3dev).

I recommend you to upgrade your ruby 1.9 to 1.9.1-p429 or 1.9.2-rc1.

The vulnerability does not directly affect to Ruby 1.8 series.

The vulnerability was found and reported by Masaya TARUI.

Though this not affecting the Linux version of Ruby, we will need a CVE identifier
for purpose of properly tracking is.

Steve, could you please allocate one?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
