{
  "CVE-2010-2075": {
    "Description": "The vendor reported that the distributed source code of UnrealIRCd was compromised and altered to include a system() call that could be called with arbitrary user input.",
    "Root cause": "Compromised source code containing a backdoor.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Backdoor inserted into the source code that executes arbitrary commands."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running UnrealIRCd, potentially leading to a complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted command to the IRC server."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to connect to the IRC server.",
	  "Ability to send arbitrary commands."
    ],
	"Additional Information": "The backdoor was introduced by replacing the official source code tarball with a modified one on the official website and ftp server. The malicious code was disguised as a debug/log macro, enabling a system() call with attacker-controlled input."
