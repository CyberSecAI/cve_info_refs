Please also note that all versions of UnrealIRCD from ``3.2beta11'' through 3.2.8 are affected. This includes net-irc/unrealircd-3.2.7 in Portage now. When the server runs with the allow::options::noident flag, anyone with an overlong username can SEGFAULT the IRCD by having an overlong IRC username. See <http://forums.unrealircd.com/viewtopic.php?t=6204> for the UnrealIRCD project's security announcement.

UnrealIRCD's buildscripts can't handle that: ``./configure: line 12962: no/bin/curl-config: No such file or directory ./configure: line 12963: no/bin/curl-config: No such file or directory'' This problem effects almost every configurable part of UnrealIRCD. For all other features where there is an --enable-feature, passing configure --disable-feature acts the same as passing --disable-feature. My ebuild doesn't use --disable-* (reverting back to the style of unrealircd-3.2.7). It also fixes some of the other problems I think exist.  sed was removed from RDEPEND because it's not a runtime dependency -- it should only be in DEPEND.  UnrealIRCD runs fine for me with >=net-dns/c-ares-1.5.3. I don't think there are changes in c-ares's API that would require stabilizing c-ares-1.6.0 just for unrealircd. See <http://cool.haxx.se/cvs.cgi/curl/ares/RELEASE-NOTES?rev=1.24&only_with_tag=cares-1_6_0&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup>  I upgraded the ebuild to EAPI="2" so that it can depend on useflag for "net-misc/curl[ares,-ipv6]". However, I'm not sure if curl needs the ares useflag set for unrealircd to run - it seems to compile fine on my machine though I don't use the remote includes feature. I also set some defaults in IUSE to match the defaults of UnrealIRCD's ./Config script. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Nathan Phillip Brink (binki) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-04-16 02:20:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=260806#c9)) > Created an attachment (id=188507) [edit]  I'm sorry for the mistakes in my previous comment. > When the user builds without USE="curl", --disable-curl is passed to I should have said ``with USE="-curl"''  > ./configure.

Aaaaand here's the diff. Nature of the backdoor should be obvious upon inspection.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: [irc-security] UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 backdoored on official ftp
and site

Hello folks,

I'd like to let you know that there's been a compromise of the
unrealircd website and ftp and the 3.2.8.1 tarball release had been
replaced by a backdoored copy.

I'm attaching Syzops original security advisory from
<http://www.unrealircd.com/txt/unrealsecadvisory.20100612.txt>

Yours,
satmd
UnrealIRCd support staff

Hi all,

This is very embarrassing...

We found out that the Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz file on our mirrors has been
replaced quite a while ago with a version with a backdoor (trojan) in
it. This backdoor allows a person to execute ANY command with the
privileges of the user running the ircd. The backdoor can be executed
regardless of any user
restrictions (so even if you have passworded server or hub that doesn't
allow
any users in).

It appears the replacement of the .tar.gz occurred in November 2009 (at
least on some mirrors). It seems nobody noticed it until now.

Obviously, this is a very serious issue, and we're taking precautions
so this will never happen again, and if it somehow does that it will be
noticed quickly.
We will also re-implement PGP/GPG signing of releases. Even though in
practice
(very) few people verify files, it will still be useful for those
people who do.

Safe versions
==============

The Windows (SSL and non-ssl) versions are NOT affected.

CVS is also not affected.

3.2.8 and any earlier versions are not affected.

Any Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz downloaded BEFORE November 10 2009 should be
safe, but you should really double-check, see next.

How to check if you're running the backdoored version
======================================================
Two ways:

One is to check if the Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz you have is good or bad by
running 'md5sum Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz' on it.
Backdoored version (BAD) is: 752e46f2d873c1679fa99de3f52a274d
Official version (GOOD) is: 7b741e94e867c0a7370553fd01506c66

The other way is to run this command in your Unreal3.2 directory:
grep DEBUG3_DOLOG_SYSTEM include/struct.h
If it outputs two lines, then you're running the backdoored/trojanized
version.
If it outputs nothing, then you're safe and there's nothing to do.

What to do if you're running the backdoored version
====================================================
Obviously, you only need to do this if you checked you are indeed
running the
backdoored version, as mentioned above. Otherwise there's no point in
continuing, as the version on our website is (now back) the good one
from April 13 2009 and nothing 'new'.

Solution:
* Re-download from <http://www.unrealircd.com/>
* Verify MD5 (or SHA1) checksums, see next section (!)
* Recompile and restart UnrealIRCd

The backdoor is in the core, it is not possible to 'clean' UnrealIRCd
without
a restart or through a module.

How to verify that the release is the official version
=======================================================
You can check by running 'md5sum Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz', it should
output: 7b741e94e867c0a7370553fd01506c66  Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz

For reference, here are the md5sums for ALL proper files:
7b741e94e867c0a7370553fd01506c66  Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz
5a6941385cd04f19d9f4241e5c912d18  Unreal3.2.8.1.exe
a54eafa6861b6219f4f28451450cdbd3  Unreal3.2.8.1-SSL.exe

These are the EXACT same MD5sums as mentioned on April 13 2009 in the
initial 3.2.8.1 announcement to the unreal-notify and unreal-users
mailing list.
<<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=49E341E0.3000702%40vulnscan.org&forum_name=unreal-notify>>

Finally
========
Again, I would like to apologize about this security breach.
We simply did not notice, but should have.
We did not check the files on all mirrors regularly, but should have.
We did not sign releases through PGP/GPG, but should have done so.

This advisory (and updates to it, if any) is posted to:
<http://www.unrealircd.com/txt/unrealsecadvisory.20100612.txt>

# UnrealIRCd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201006-21**

Multiple vulnerabilities in UnrealIRCd might allow remote attackers to
compromise the "unrealircd" account, or cause a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/unrealircd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.2.8.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.2.8.1-r1** |

### Background

UnrealIRCd is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) daemon.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in UnrealIRCd:

* The vendor reported a buffer overflow in the user authorization
  code (CVE-2009-4893).
* The vendor reported that the distributed source code of UnrealIRCd
  was compromised and altered to include a system() call that could be
  called with arbitrary user input (CVE-2010-2075).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause the
execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running
UnrealIRCd, or a Denial of Service condition. NOTE: By default
UnrealIRCd on Gentoo is run with the privileges of the "unrealircd"
user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All UnrealIRCd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/unrealircd-3.2.8.1-r1"
```
