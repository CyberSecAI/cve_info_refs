Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2627

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper handling of backslash characters (`\`) in URLs provided by game servers within the Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 2142 game clients. Specifically, when the client downloads files from URLs specified by the server for elements like sponsor logos, community logos, demos, and custom maps, it does not sanitize the filename. This allows directory traversal attacks.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the failure to prevent directory traversal sequences like `..\` within filenames retrieved from URLs. This allows a malicious server to manipulate the save path of downloaded files.
    *   **Missing Input Validation:** The game client fails to validate and sanitize filenames obtained from URLs, leading to arbitrary file write vulnerability.
    *   **Automatic URL Loading:** The client automatically loads URLs for logos and other resources, and this feature cannot be disabled.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Write:** A malicious server can force the game client to download an arbitrary file to a specific location on the client's system via directory traversal
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** By writing an executable to a location such as the Startup folder of Windows, the attacker achieves remote code execution. The executable will be launched the next time the client logs in or restarts.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Game Server:** The attack is initiated from a compromised or maliciously controlled Battlefield 2 or Battlefield 2142 server.
    *   **Server-Supplied URLs:** The server provides specially crafted URLs containing directory traversal sequences in the filename part.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs control over a Battlefield 2 or Battlefield 2142 game server.
    *   The attacker must be able to set the URL fields for logos and other downloadable content to malicious URLs.
    *   The attack exploits the fact that clients automatically download resources from these URLs upon joining a server or even just selecting the server from the list.

**Technical Details:**

*   The client downloads files to a `LogoCache` or `HttpCache` folder within the user's Documents folder.
*   The vulnerability affects the way the game client saves files downloaded from URLs specified by the server.
*   The exploit utilizes directory traversal sequences such as `..\` within the filename portion of the URL.

**Example Exploit:**
    *   The provided example shows how a server can provide a URL containing directory traversal sequences in the filename: `http://SERVER/..\..\..\..\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\owned.exe`
    *   When the client connects, the file `owned.exe` is downloaded to the `Startup` folder of the Windows user account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is client-side.
*   There is no fix provided according to the content.
