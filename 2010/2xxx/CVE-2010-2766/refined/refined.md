Response:
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code used to normalize a document contained a logical flaw. A static count of the document's child nodes was used in the traversal, so a page could be constructed that would remove DOM nodes during this normalization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code does not account for a varying number of child nodes during normalization and does not validate the child index is within bounds, leading to out-of-bounds access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird or SeaMonkey.",
  "Attack vectors": "Visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious web page or file that exploits the vulnerability."
