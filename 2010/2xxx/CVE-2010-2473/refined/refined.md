{
  "cveId": "CVE-2010-2473",
  "description": "Drupal 6.x before 6.16 and 5.x before version 5.22 does not properly block users under certain circumstances. A user with an open session that was blocked could maintain their session on the Drupal site despite being blocked.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from Drupal's failure to properly invalidate user sessions upon blocking a user. An existing session for a blocked user is not terminated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper session management",
      "Insufficient access control enforcement"
    ],
    "impact": "A blocked user can maintain an active session on the Drupal site, effectively bypassing the block and potentially performing actions they should not be authorized to.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network access"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to have an established session on the vulnerable Drupal site before being blocked by an administrator."
