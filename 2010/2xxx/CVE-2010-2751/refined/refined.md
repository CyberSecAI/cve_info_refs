The content is related to CVE-2010-2751.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of redirects when using `location.href` and `location.reload()` in combination with `history.back()` and `history.forward()`. When a page with an automatic redirect to an HTTPS page is loaded, then the same address is loaded again with the redirection disabled, and then reloaded with the redirection enabled, the browser's history mechanism fails to properly update the URL in the address bar, resulting in a spoofed URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The browser's location bar displays the URL of the original HTTP page instead of the final HTTPS URL after the redirect.
- The security indicators (SSL/TLS badging) in the address bar are incorrectly associated with the original HTTP resource, making it appear secure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a user into believing they are on a secure HTTPS site when they are actually viewing an HTTP page. This could be exploited to phish users for credentials or conduct other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack requires a server that can redirect an HTTP request to an HTTPS resource.
- The attacker crafts a specific sequence of actions involving `location.href`, `location.reload()`, `history.back()`, and `history.forward()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs control over a server capable of performing redirects.
- The attacker needs to be able to persuade the user to visit the initial HTTP URL and perform the required actions.
