| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=541279#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-25 13:19:30 UTC  ``` Moritz Naumann reported multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws, present in the way Cacti web interface used to process HTML form content. If a remote attacker could trick a local user who is logged into Cacti into visiting a specially-crafted HTML page, the attacker could retrieve and potentially modify confidential Cacti data.

Hi!

Cacti 0.8.7g was released some days ago:
  <http://cacti.net/release_notes_0_8_7g.php>

Release notes mention couple of security issue previously fixed in
(withdrawn) 0.8.7f, but adds new protections against couple of XSS
issues.

"XSS 4" from CVE-2009-4032 was not fixed previously:
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=541279#c17>

Fixed in include/top_graph_header.php change in:
  <http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc?view=rev&revision=6025>

Search pattern in log file viewer was not filtered for bad characters,
or escaped before echoing pattern back to page:
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=459105>

Possible victims are administrative users with access to log viewer
page.  Fixed in r6025, which adds escaping to other search patterns
too, but others were filtered previously.

Multiple persistent XSS via various item names or descriptions.
Attacker needs to have certain administrative privileges, so this is
fairly lame issue.
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=459229>

Originally discovered for template names, where template XML import
provides additional vector (trusted admin tricked to import untrusted
template vs. untrusted admin).  HTML escaping added on various places
in r6037, r6038, r6041 and r6042.
