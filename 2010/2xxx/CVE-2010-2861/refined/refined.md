Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2861

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a classic directory traversal, also known as arbitrary file retrieval. A server-side script is tricked into providing the contents of a file it shouldn't by using special strings like `../` to move up directory levels.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the attacker to access files and directories outside the intended webroot.
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows attackers to read sensitive configuration files, such as `neo-security.xml` (containing database credentials) and `password.properties` (containing the ColdFusion admin password).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Source Code Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain the source code of the target website, which could expose other vulnerabilities.
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers can gain access to database credentials and the ColdFusion administrator password.
- **Full System Compromise:** If the attacker gains access to the CF admin console by cracking or bypassing the password protection, they can upload a malicious CFM script that allows them to execute remote commands with SYSTEM privileges, potentially leading to complete OS compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  HTTP requests with manipulated file paths containing `../` sequences.
-  Exploitation can be done remotely over HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or knowledge of credentials to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.
- Access to the ColdFusion admin console is not required for initial access, but it is required to gain full control of the system.
- The attacker needs network access to the ColdFusion server (can be internet facing).

**Additional Technical Details and Nuances:**
- The `password.properties` file contains the ColdFusion admin password, which may be stored either in clear text or hashed using SHA1 (ColdFusion versions MX7, 8 and 9).
- The attacker can sometimes bypass the need to crack the SHA1 hash to login to the CF admin console by injecting a modified hash back into the login form.
- Once inside the CF admin console, the attacker can schedule a task to upload a CFM backdoor that enables arbitrary command execution, gaining SYSTEM privileges.
- Affected ColdFusion versions include 8.0, 8.0.1, 9.0, 9.0.1 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh and UNIX.
- Adobe provided a patch, but restrictions to the affected file paths can also mitigate the vulnerability.
