Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2010-2795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is within the phpCAS library, a client library for PHP used to interact with Central Authentication Service (CAS) servers. The specific nature of the vulnerability within phpCAS is not detailed within the provided content, but it is referenced as one of several vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The content indicates "Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpCAS". CVE-2010-2795 is one of those vulnerabilities. The Debian Security Advisory also references CVE-2010-2796, CVE-2010-3690, CVE-2010-3691 and CVE-2010-3692, indicating a series of related vulnerabilities within phpCAS. The exact nature of the weaknesses is not described further in this content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The content categorizes the problem type as "remote". This suggests the vulnerability could be exploited over a network. The impact of the specific vulnerabilities isn't detailed beyond the risk of remote exploitation, but given that phpCAS is used for authentication, it's likely that a successful exploit could allow for bypassing or compromising the authentication process.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a network based, remote exploitation of vulnerabilities within the phpCAS library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
Attackers need to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable system running phpCAS. No specific position or other capabilities are mentioned.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content from Debian indicates that the Moodle course management system includes a copy of phpCAS. Therefore, Moodle installations were also vulnerable.
The advisory indicates the versions in the oldstable (lenny) distribution was vulnerable and needed to be upgraded. The advisory also notes that the stable (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions already contain a fixed version of phpCAS. This suggests that the issue was addressed in later versions of phpCAS, and these were included in the noted distributions.
The Jasig wiki information shows that phpCAS is an official client and also indicates a client security recommendations document exists, however that document is not included in the content provided.

**Summary of extracted information:**
- **Root cause:**  Vulnerabilities in the phpCAS library.
- **Weaknesses:** Several unspecified vulnerabilities within phpCAS
- **Impact:** Remote exploitation, potentially leading to compromised authentication.
- **Attack vector:** Network-based attacks targeting phpCAS.
- **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send network requests to vulnerable systems.
