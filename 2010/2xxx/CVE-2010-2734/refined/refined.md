Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2010-2734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation of the HTTP stream in the UAG Mobile Portal. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): A non-persistent XSS vulnerability exists in the Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) mobile portal. This allows specially crafted script code to run under the guise of the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the targeted user's session.
- This could lead to:
  - Spoofing content displayed to the user.
  - Disclosure of sensitive information.
  - Taking any action that the user could perform on the affected website on behalf of the targeted user, which could lead to elevation of privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing script code.
- The attacker convinces a user to click this crafted URL through various methods:
  - Email messages.
  - Instant messenger messages.
  - Embedding the link on a website they control.
  - Compromised websites or websites that accept user-generated content.
- Once the user clicks the link, the malicious script is executed within the user's browser in the context of the UAG server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with injected script code.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince users to click the crafted link via social engineering or other means.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is triggered when the user loads the page with the malicious URL.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is non-persistent, meaning the injected script is not permanently stored on the server.
- The UAG mobile portal is not enabled by default.
- The vulnerability affects UAG servers and clients that access the UAG Web Monitor.
- The update modifies the way that the UAG mobile portal accepts input.
