# Breaking the “encryption algorithm” for Microsoft Dynamics GP – Dexterity Encryption

FULL DISCLOSURE – I HAVE UPDATED THE ORIGINAL POST AND HAVE ADDED COMMENTS IN ITALIC AND RETRACTED OTHERS WITH A STRIKETHROUGH

I use the term “encryption” loosely in this article. As you read on, you’ll realize why…

I’ve been doing some work on a plugin for [Microsoft Dynamics GP](http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/en/us/products/gp-overview.aspx), which is an accounting system aimed at Medium sized to Large businesses. To give you an idea of what type of application this is: There are companies that pay somewhere around $10,000-$15,000 to consultants or VARS (Value Added Resellers) to implement a Microsoft Dynamics GP solution for their business. Many of the VARs have their own plugins and solutions for Microsoft Dynamics GP, usually written in .NET or [Dexterity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexterity_programming_language). The process of installing and maintaining GP is an industry all it’s own and it’s not cheap for a company to maintain this accounting system.

I’ve been searching for the “encryption algorithm” or at least some way other way to “encrypt” data in GP in some other way than within Dexterity code. I was really hoping that there would be some .NET library that would do this for me, but I was never able to find anything that would help me do this. So, I became interested in what type of “encryption” this is. Somewhere (I can’t remember where) I found something that indicated that the it’s a symmetric key encryption algorithm. The message boards were not much help either. Anywhere I went, I basically saw this same type of statement, [“the encryption algorithm is a closely guarded secret”.](http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/33042377/odbc-dsn-dynamics-gp-syst.aspx)

Today, while doing some testing, I noticed something with data that we were saving to a field which utilizes the GP “encryption”. The plugin I was testing puts data in an encrypted field (not that it needs to because it’s not sensitive in nature), and I was testing with the same values each time. As I would expect, I saw the same data stored in the field in the database for each row in the table. However, I noticed that one of the entries was different, by 2 characters. That seemed very odd to me. After looking at it some more and conducting some more tests, it looks like I simply miskeyed my test data, but it prompted me to take another look at this.

After trying a couple different combinations of test data, it became very obvious that changing only one character in the test data appeared to only alter 2 characters of the encrypted data. So I ran through a battery of tests, and came up with this:

‘1’=’DF’, ‘2’=’DC’, ‘3’=’DD’, ‘4’=’DA’, ‘5’=’DB’, ‘6’=’D8′, ‘7’=’D9′, ‘8’=’D6′,

‘9’=’D7′, ‘A’=’AF’, ‘B’=’AC’, ‘C’=’AD’, ‘D’=’AA’, ‘E’=’AB’, ‘F’=’A8’, ‘G’=’A9’,

‘H’=’A6’, ‘I’=’A7’, ‘J’=’A4’, ‘K’=’A5’, ‘L’=’A2’, ‘M’=’A3’, ‘N’=’A0’, ‘O’=’A1’,

‘P’=’BE’, ‘Q’=’BF’, ‘R’=’BC’, ‘S’=’BD’, ‘T’=’BA’, ‘U’=’BB’, ‘V’=’B8’, ‘W’=’B9’,

‘X’=’B6’, ‘Y’=’B7’, ‘Z’=’B4’, ‘a’=’8F’, ‘b’=’8C’, ‘c’=’8D’, ‘d’=’8A’, ‘e’=’8B’,

‘f’=’88’, ‘g’=’89’, ‘h’=’86’, ‘i’=’87’, ‘j’=’84’, ‘k’=’85’, ‘l’=’82’, ‘m’=’83’,

‘n’=’80’, ‘o’=’81’, ‘p’=’9E’, ‘q’=’9F’, ‘r’=’9C’, ‘s’=’9D’, ‘t’=’9A’, ‘u’=’9B’,

‘v’=’98’, ‘w’=’99’, ‘x’=’96’, ‘y’=’97’, ‘z’=’94’, ‘!’=’CF’, ‘@’=’AE’, ‘#’=’CD’,

‘$’=’CA’, ‘%’=’CB’, ‘^’=’B0’, ‘&’=’C8’, ‘\*’=’C4’, ‘(‘=’C6’, ‘)’=’C7’, ‘ ‘=’CE’,

”=’20’, ”=’00’,’-‘=’C3’, ‘\_’=’B1’, ‘=’=’D3’, ‘+’=’C5’, ‘[‘=’B5’, ‘]’=’B3’,

‘{‘=’95’, ‘}’=’93’, ”=’B2′, ‘|’=’92’, ‘;’=’D5’, ‘:’=’D4′, ””=’C9’, ‘”‘=’CC’,

‘=’=’C2’, ‘<‘=’D2’, ‘.’=’C0’, ‘>’=’D0’, ‘/’=’C1’, ‘?’=’D1’, ‘`’=’8E’, ‘~’=’90’

Yep, it’s basically your run-of-the-mill Substitution cipher. The worst part, there’s evidence all over the place that this was a VERY weak encryption algorithm for awhile, but nobody seemed to pay any attention to it when people were asking how they could reset passwords of users in the database ([Post 1](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/gpmohammad/comments/33220.aspx) – [Post 2](http://www.microsoftdynamicsforums.com/forums/forum_posts.asp?TID=1647))

I did some more searching, because there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW THIS… I found a good write up on the MSDN blogs that explains pretty well how the GP encryption was used ([here](http://blogs.msdn.com/developingfordynamicsgp/archive/2008/10/02/why-does-microsoft-dynamics-gp-encrypt-passwords.aspx)).

The article is evidence to support a theory that I have, which is after GP moved to SQL server authentication, the encryption method didn’t seem to be needed any longer so they never replaced. I don’t know if the word was released to developers and integrators that the “encryption algorithm” wasn’t ideal for storage of sensitive information, but I don’t know how many plugins or customizations use it either.

EXCEPT…. Microsoft still uses it for their GP system password, which is the password needed to get to the Security Roles/Tasks and all the User Security related forms while in GP. What’s even worse, if you create a new user, you have to give the user explicit rights to the company or companies you want the user to access, but you DON’T HAVE TO GIVE ACCESS TO THE DYNAMICS DATABASE. What that means is if you create a base user in GP, that user can log into the SQL server and run select AND INSERT statements on tables containing the “encrypted” GP System password and Security Roles… Not good… *I must correct this and clarify. By default, GP gives the user access to the DYNAMICS database but the user CANNOT login to the SQL server using SQL Enterprise Manager. Here’s what happened: I reset the LESSONUSER’s passwords with SQL Enterprise Manager and afterward I was able to login to SQL Enterprise Manager with the LESSONUSER’s credentials. Some flag most have been updated when I reset the password – I need to investigate this further (this was all done in a Test environment). This was a BIG oversight on my part and I apologize for this. I really should have tested this out more before posting that statement. (Thank you Mark and others that pointed this out to me).*

I created a function that you can use to decrypt GP “encrypted” data. You can find it [here](http://www.christopherkois.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fn_decrypt_value.txt) *(link is working again)*. If you create the function on the SQL server, you can then retrieve the Master password by running this query:

```
select dbo.[fn_Decrypt_Value] (PASSWORD, 16) from DYNAMICS.dbo.SY02400
```

*Another point I need to clarify, as Mark pointed out, this master password is just a secondary password that is OPTIONAL.* *THIS PASSWORD DOES NOT GIVE YOU ACCESS TO GP.* *If you have this password set, the user attempting to access the Security Roles/User Forms will need to enter it. This is not a very secure way to store this password, but it is not the primary form of authentication to GP.*

I did ALOT of searching to see if anyone had reported this in the past, but I found no indication of this ever being found. I don’t know if this is a “REAL” discovery, but I would think it’s worth knowing. I hope you found this informative!

*This was originally meant to be a disclosure that the Microsoft Dynamics GP Dexterity Encryption algorithm was weak and has been broken. The retracted statement was an oversight on my part and I’m sorry for this.*

   Chris,

   You didn’t do that much research. You’ve confused the SYSTEM password with the SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR. The SYSTEM password is an OPTIONAL component of security. If users don’t have permission to a resource the SYSTEM password won’t get them there. It was designed as a secondary defense, not a primary one.

   Secondly, you’ve confused access to GP companies with access to SQL tables. Security in GP provides access to company databases via the interface. That’s why you don’t have to grant access to the Dynamics databases, it’s shared among companies. None of this grants SQL level access to the tables.Your statement that a base GP user has direct access to SQL tables is simply false. It’s flat out wrong. Even a basic GP user could have told you that. You could have used the GP demo site to test that without installing even installing anything. I expect to see that statement publicly corrected.

   Your research examples are a mixture of the SYSTEM password and user login passwords. They are not the same thing and they don’t use the same encryption. A number of people including myself have publicly shown how to reset the system password. It’s not a big secret.

   There are probably a dozen well know Dynamics GP blogs, forums and newsgroups that you could have asked this question on before publicly making incorrect statements. Next time, drop me an email, I’ll help you out.

   I saw and responded to your article on Slashdot as well, but I’ll expand on here, because I think you’re misunderstanding the overall design of Dynamics GP.

   1. You cannot create a user within Dynamics GP or grant company access unless you are logged in as ‘sa’ or ‘DYNSA’. Anyone else with access to the user-creation window will see the ‘Save” button greyed out. When users are set up within the system, they always have access to DYNAMICS (they need it for the system to function)

   2. You can set up a SQL login for a user, and grant that user access to company databases and give that user the DYNGRP role. If you have security access to the SQL server, then you can do this easily enough. If you work for me and you do such a thing, you will be fired. End of story.

   3. Users set up within GP are given access to the Dynamics databases and are granted the DYNGRP role, so yes, they technically have access to the whole system. It doesn’t do them much good outside GP, though, because their password is encrypted. The encryption used is a very strong encryption method. Microsoft does not release information on the key used, as there are other tools for customizations, reports, etc, that help deal with this.

   4. Security within Dynamics GP is much more granular than is available within SQL server, this is why nothing is encrypted and why the system is setup the way it is. You’re following a pink elephant trying to work out a decryption mechanism for something as benign as the System Password. I’ve seen many MANY secure GP isntallations where everyone and their dog knows the system password (hell, the vast majority still use the default password of ‘ACCESS’). The systems are secure, nonetheless, because the proper security roles and tasks have been put in place by those who implemented it.

   I’m very curious to hear what kind of plug-ins you are trying to develop for Dynamics GP, what the business use for those are, and your experience with Dynamics. From the sound of your article, you may be wise to do some research in the system and the recommended tools available (ie eConnect) for integrating data into the system, as you could very easily hose it. Accounting systems are not something you want to be messing around with if you don’t understand how they work.

   Thank you for the comments. I was wrong with regards to the user having direct access to the SQL Server using SQL Enterprise Manager. I apologize for this oversight. I thank you for correcting me.

   Despite that retraction, this still doesn’t change the fact that the Microsoft Dynamics GP Dexterity Encryption is VERY weak and should not be used to keep any sensitive information a secret.

   I submitted a correction to Slashdot in hopes that they will remove the misleading statements and the false statement that was keyed in on when the article was submitted.

   I am hoping they will update the post.

    Oh my, oh my, what have you gotten yourself into… I am not here to rant, but rather to provide some council as you clearly have bargained for more than you could handle. Even my 15-year old has grasped the concept of “read before you post”. C’mon, I answer close to 50 questions a day on 4 forums, 2 public, 2 private and run one of the most widely read blogs on the subject of Microsoft Dynamics GP. You could have simply dropped me an email (like the many I receive a day asking for a free consultation) on how the passwords in GP work…but no! I guess you had to discover it all by yourself AND make it public. I guess I don’t blame you, as this is just sometimes human nature. But judgement… now, that’s a whole different ballgame.

    I have posted 7 facts you should at least try to read… again, try to read… they will help you in uncovering some more things about GP.

    First off, thank you everyone who has posted comments and contacted me about this post. I never intended to post any false information and I’m glad any false or misleading statements have been pointed out and subsequently corrected.

    I think there’s a BIG misunderstanding here regarding encryption of GP user passwords. I NEVER stated that I broke the encryption used for passwords of GP users. In fact, I stated that I didn’t know how much the built-in Dexterity encryption was used anymore and that I found it used in only one place, the system password. I should have clarified what the system password did at the time of first post, which is to provide secondary authorization and does NOT allow you to login to GP (this was an oversight on my part and I have since I apologized, corrected my post, and contacted anyone who keyed in on those statements as an issue when they picked up this article and posted it to their own site). The false statement regarding the GP user having the ability to login directly to the SQL server has been retracted (I’m very sorry about this and I should have done more testing prior to disclosure). Slashdot has since updated their post.

    The ORIGINAL title of the article still stands, the built-in Dexterity encryption has been broken. If anyone is using this encryption to store sensitive information, they should re-evaluate their solution. As I originally stated, I don’t know if this is a “REAL” discovery (it sounds like many in the GP community knew it was weak already, but have not directed me to evidence that suggests it had been completely broken in the past). If you have a link to an article that shows it was broken in the past, I will link it into my post and claim that I really didn’t find anything. However, I haven’t found such an article.

scribblej writes *"Many large companies use Microsoft's Dynamics GP product for accounting, and many of these companies use it to store credit card numbers for billing customers. Turns out these numbers (and anything else in GP) are [encrypted only by means of a simple substitution cipher](http://www.christopherkois.com/?p=448). This includes the master system password, which can be easily selected and decrypted from the GP database by any user. Quoting: '[Y]ou DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ACCESS TO THE DYNAMICS DATABASE. What that means is if you create a base user in GP, that user can log into the SQL server and run a select statement on the table containing the "encrypted" GP System password. Not good.'"*
**Update: 05/22 02:57 GMT** by  **[T](http://www.monkey.org/~timothy/)** : The original linked post has been revised in a few places; significantly, the following has been added as a correction: "By default, GP gives the user access to the DYNAMICS database but the user CANNOT login to the SQL server using SQL Enterprise Manager."

  The weakness of encryption is justified by the non-importance of the asset it protects.

    Many large companies use Microsoft's Dynamics GP product for accounting, and many of these companies use it to store credit card numbers for billing customers.

    Sorry, if you're actually going to say that a lot of consumer credit cards aren't valuable or important, you're going to have to provide just a teensy bit more justification.

          As of 1.1 (the only document I have handy), the requirement is "Strong cryptography, such as Triple-DES 128-bit or AES 256-bit". I'm sure it only got more stringent after that.

        Whoever coded the "encryption" routine really dropped the ball. SQL Server supports AES encryption on individual fields. The first result of a Google search for "sql server field encryption" points to an MSDN article with code examples of how to use AES-256 encryption.

        How do these things keep happening? There have to be mistakes on so many levels. Whoever developed the spec obviously was clueless. The person who coded the spec was probably clueless, and/or didn't have the authority to do things the right way. The tools to make these applications secure are available. You'd think that a Microsoft coder using a Microsoft database could use the Microsoft solution properly.

        The more I deal with corporate America and the people who find themselves in charge of projects, the more I believe that competence really is a Bell curve with the center of the curve being INCOMPETENT, the far left is DISABLED. How do these people sleep at night? The only thing that I can figure is that they really are ignorant. If I do something half assed, it bugs me. It keeps me up at night. So either these people just don't give a rats ass and are working in a culture that lacks accountability, or they are completely ignorant and are working in a culture that lacks accountability. A friend of mine once told me, "Most people don't do the right thing because it is the right thing. They do the right thing because they fear the consequences of getting caught doing the wrong thing." Every where I look in society, there are fewer and fewer consequences.

    I have the displeasure of working with Great Plains regularly, and this isn't surprising at all.

    A couple of points for the panic stricken:

    1. Great Plains uses SQL logins and it hashes the passwords of users created from within GP. Since 9.0, it salts this hash using the sql server name. A GP user other than sa can NOT login to SQL Enterprise Manager with their GP credentials. That encryption has NOT been broken (yet). (That WOULD be a real problem.)

    2. The ability to decrypt the System password is useless if you can't query the system password from the database. If your users have the ability to query any table in the database directly, then you have a bigger problem than weak encryption.

    3. GP overlays role and task based security on top of the SQL login mechanism. Having the decrypted System Password is less useful if your application user doesn't have the ability to reach the User Setup or Security Options menus. These menus should be turned off for everyone not in the GP PowerUser role.

    Is this great for GP? No. Neither is it the harbinger of the apocalypse.

      Not that long ago, competent security was a criminal offense to export. It still is, unless the code is Open Source (and we all know how Microsoft loves Open Source). The practical difference between a Caesar cipher and DES is that the Caesar cipher is faster so more transactions can be performed. You could do more leaving things in plain-text, but regulations usually require encryption of some sort for this kind of data. However, those same regulations don't usually stipulate any particular strength of encryption, so Caesar becomes ideal. The high throughput will sell better and the absence of security means it evades export controls. You end up with the largest possible market.

      If there was a recognized, official (or even semi-official) standard API and ABI for cryptography libraries, ITAR would be less of an issue. You could swap out any crypto library in any product and swap in an alternative. You could then use any crypto library (and therefore any crypto algorithm) you liked.

      If standards better-mandated what level of security was required, weak algorithms would never be used. No corporation would dare risk the penalties and so no vendor would dare supply soft crypto.

      The market's preference for high throughput is perfectly reasonable, but it is often unwilling to invest in security - which is why there are so many issues of this kind. If corporations were more willing to invest in securing their systems, say by using hardware crypto engines to get the high throughput they needed, they would be able to use essentially bullet-proof algorithms without harming the amount of data they could manage.

        Caesar, and substitution-based ciphers in general, are so easy to break that they're given as puzzles in the daily newspapers (some aphorism is encrypted with a substitution cipher; you need to figure out what it is). Basically, you know the frequencies with which various letters, pairs of letters, etc. appear in English text; so you can compute the frequencies with which the characters in the ciphertext appear and determine a correspondence that way.

        Actually, RC4 is not that much slower than Casear, mainly because is implemented sort of like Caesar with extra steps to modify the substitution table at runtime. OpenSSL can do RC4 on modern hardware faster than 300 MB/s. Even though it is as a "combiner" stream cipher and as such tricky to actually use securely, it would be much better than the probably ad-hoc implemented Caesar.

Anyone repeating that is probably on the payroll of one of those firms or so dumb that they should be bitchslapped into next week for opening their mouth.

      Well, that's what I mean. pserver is insecure and never pretends to be anything more than it is--a barebones security mechanism that won't thwart anyone with a genuine interest in stealing passwords. All it would do is keep someone from \*accidentally\* seeing somebody else's password if they were monitoring network traffic. That's about it.

      That Microsoft is using basically the same thing to secure a corporate accounting system that holds genuinely sensitive data is both terrifying and laughable.

  I don't know if this is any news at all. Most ERP systems do not have the data in the database encrypted at all. You should never give any direct access to your ERP database to anybody. If absolutely necessary, just create a view in another DB schema and give a read access to it only to selected users (so they could access for example the inventory information useing excel/access).

    *You should never give any direct access to your ERP database to anybody*

    That's slight overkill. I would encourage you to create proper database users, and grant them select/update/insert/delete rights only as appropriate. If you need per-column permissions, create views that hide those columns, and if they need read/write access, provide instead-of triggers on those views to support their needs.

    The main reasons I would encourage you not to let users have direct access:

    1) Users don't know what they're seeing, they don't know which lookup tables to join to, or they don't understand how the data's organized. They'll write their own reports, come to the wrong conclusions, convince management of their erroneous beliefs, and you'll have to clean up the mess. "I got my data from the database" shouldn't be good enough.

    2) Most ERP products (really, most database-backed products) are not built to keep themselves truly logically consistent without the help of some outside application layer. There are lots of reasons for that: developers are taught that databases are just for storage, they don't want to learn procedural SQL, they're trying to be database-agnostic the only way they know how, ... Giving users write access means they can easily get all the data out of synch (I don't just mean foreign keys here, thank you) by performing only half of a complex operation the application layer would have guaranteed fully done.

    Yes but this is GP we are talking about there really is no "Application Server" the clients all connect to the database! The users running the client therefore must have access to connect to the database and do DML queries on many objects. Any users that actually need to run the application and not some limited web front end you have built or something are SQL users. The only real workaround is to only allow database connections from selct hosts and have one of those hosts be a terminal server. The best part is the GP application has lots bugs when running under terminal services!

  Sorry... I didn't expect /. to pick this up, and didn't really warn Chris Kois that I'd submitted it. My fault.

  Below is the original article:

  I use the term "encryption" loosely in this article. As you read on, you'll realize why...

  I've been doing some work on a plugin for Microsoft Dynamics GP, which is an accounting system aimed at Medium sized to Large businesses. To give you an idea of what type of application this is: There are companies that pay somewhere around $10,000-$15,000 to consultants or VARS (Value Added Resellers) to implement a Microsoft Dynamics GP solution for their business. Many of the VARs have their own plugins and solutions for Microsoft Dynamics GP, usually written in .NET or Dexterity. The process of installing and maintaining GP is an industry all it's own and it's not cheap for a company to maintain this accounting system.

  I've been searching for the "encryption algorithm" or at least some way other way to "encrypt" data in GP in some other way than within Dexterity code. I was really hoping that there would be some .NET library that would do this for me, but I was never able to find anything that would help me do this. So, I became interested in what type of "encryption" this is. Somewhere (I can't remember where) I found something that indicated that the it's a symmetric key encryption algorithm. The message boards were not much help either. Anywhere I went, I basically saw this same type of statement, "the encryption algorithm is a closely guarded secret".

  Today, while doing some testing, I noticed something with data that we were saving to a field which utilizes the GP "encryption". The plugin I was testing puts data in an encrypted field (not that it needs to because it's not sensitive in nature), and I was testing with the same values each time. As I would expect, I saw the same data stored in the field in the database for each row in the table. However, I noticed that one of the entries was different, by 2 characters. That seemed very odd to me. After looking at it some more and conducting some more tests, it looks like I simply miskeyed my test data, but it prompted me to take another look at this.

  After trying a couple different combinations of test data, it became very obvious that changing only one character in the test data appeared to only alter 2 characters of the encrypted data. So I ran through a battery of tests, and came up with this:

  Yep, it's basically your run-of-the-mill Substitution cipher. The worst part, there's evidence all over the place that this was a VERY weak encryption algorithm for awhile, but nobody seemed to pay any attention to it when people were asking how they could reset passwords of users in the database (Post 1 - Post 2)

  I did some more searching, because there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW THIS... I found a good write up on the MSDN blogs that explains pretty well how the GP encryption was used (here).

  The article is evidence to support a theory that I have, which is after GP moved to SQL server authentication, the encryption method didn't seem to be needed any longer so they never replaced. I don't know if the word was released to developers and integrators that the "encryption algorithm" wasn't ideal for storage of sensitive information, but I don't know how many plugins or customizations use it either.

  EXCEPT.... Microsoft still uses it for their GP system password, which is the password needed to get to the Security Roles/Tasks and all the User Security related forms while in GP. What's even worse, if you create a new user, you have to give the user explicit rights to the company or companies you want the user to access, but you DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ACCESS TO THE DYNAMICS DATABASE.

    I'm a Microsoft MVP for Dynamics GP and this line "What that means is if you create a base user in GP, that user can log into the SQL server and run a select statement on the table containing the "encrypted" GP System password... " is completely false. GP users can't log in to SQL using their GP passwords. The article doesn't state a version being used. On some older versions it was possible to chose to allow a user to access SQL with their GP login. This is not possible on any of the supported versions of Dynamics GP.
    Additionally, the System password referred to has always been a second line of defense. Security has to be given to a particular window in the application before GP even asks for the System password. Relying on the System password alone for security has never been a best practice.
    There are a number of other areas where the writer confuses different types of passwords and security in Dynamics GP making it clear that he's never actually used the application to understand how differnt passwords and settings interact to provide security.

In doing so, they destroyed the audit trail at the database level. All DB updates are made by one user making it a massive challenge to determine who made a change to financial data. Many of the AX and SL companies we work with get dinged for this in each audit."

    You are more correct than you expected. The encoding algorithm is not a Caesar Cipher algorithm. Going by the code table in the article, **Microsoft simply XORs the incoming data with 0xEE.** To undo the cipher, XOR again with 0xEE.

    Using XOR makes for really easy coding. Instead of having an encryption and decryption function, now only one function will do both.

      Actually, XOR is frequently used for encryption, and very strong ciphers can be built by XORing the plaintext with carefully chosen bits. These are known as "stream ciphers," and the idea is to use a random number generator; the secret key is the seed you give the generator. As you note, the encryption and decryption functions are the same, which is one of the advantages (another, more important advantage is that you can create provably secure stream ciphers based on standard assumptions, such as the diff
