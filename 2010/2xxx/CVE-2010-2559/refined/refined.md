  "CVE-2010-2559": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer's improper handling of objects that have not been correctly initialized or have been deleted.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory access",
       "Incorrect object handling",
       "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote code execution with the privileges of the logged-on user. An attacker with admin privileges can take complete control of the system, potentially installing programs, changing data, or creating new accounts.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted Web pages",
      "Compromised or malicious websites",
       "Embedded ActiveX controls in applications or documents"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host or deliver a malicious webpage to a target user via web browsing, email or by embedding in a document."
