  "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2556",
  "source_text": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer's improper handling of objects that have not been correctly initialized or have been deleted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution with the privileges of the logged-on user. An attacker could take complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights, enabling them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attack: an attacker could host a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability.",
        "Compromised websites or websites with user-provided content: these may contain specially crafted content that exploits the vulnerability.",
        "Embedding an ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a specially crafted web page or utilize other attack vectors to entice the victim to view the malicious content. No specific user interaction beyond visiting the attacker controlled content is mentioned"
