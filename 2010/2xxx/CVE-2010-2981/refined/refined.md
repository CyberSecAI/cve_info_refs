  "summary": "This document provides release notes for Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers and Lightweight Access Points, focusing on version 7.0.98.0. It includes information on new features, installation notes, important considerations, and known issues. While it doesn't explicitly describe a vulnerability, it notes several important caveats and bugs that could affect security and functionality.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The document primarily focuses on bug fixes and new features in Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software version 7.0.98.0, rather than a specific vulnerability. However, several issues can be seen as potential security risks, configuration issues, or vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service or other impact.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Upgrading to controller release 6.0.196.0 or 7.0.98.0 can cause client devices to fail to complete DHCP when using the controller's internal DHCP feature (CSCth68708).",
      "RADIUS called-station-id and calling-station-id attributes send MAC addresses with lowercase characters in version 6.0+, which can break authentication if the RADIUS server is not updated.",
      "The default SNMP community strings and SNMP v3 user credentials pose a security risk.",
        "RLDP limitations: The Rogue Location Discovery Protocol (RLDP) feature has multiple limitations, including detection limited to open authentication and same-network rogues.",
     "Internal DHCP server IP addresses are not preserved across reboots, leading to potential IP conflicts.",
      "Cisco 5500 series controllers do not support fragmented pings, which may disrupt some network monitoring tools.",
      "Firewall and ACL configurations need to allow CAPWAP traffic from APs to the controller. (UDP 5246 and 5247)",
    "Web authentication redirects are only supported to HTTP (HTTP over TCP) servers, not HTTPS."
    ],
    "impact": "The listed issues may cause service disruption, authentication failures, and potential security breaches if default credentials are used or not changed. Lack of proper DHCP handling can affect network connectivity. Specific caveats mentioned (like fragmented pings or RLDP limitations) can make network management or rogue detection less effective. There are also potential security and reliability implications with issues like WPlus license migration, MAC address handling and unauthenticated messages sent on port 22",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks exploiting default SNMP credentials.",
        "Network-based attacks using fragmented pings as an attack vector. (Though it's mentioned as non supported, it can cause issues)",
         "Man-in-the-Middle attacks if web authentication is not done over HTTPS.",
         "Denial of service can be caused by using unoptimized configurations or by exploiting some of the mentioned defects"

    ],
      "required_capabilities": [
      "Network access to the affected controller or network.",
      "Ability to perform SNMP requests.",
      "Ability to perform network scans."
