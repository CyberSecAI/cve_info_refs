Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-2953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure way the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable was being set in the `/usr/bin/couchdb` script on Debian/Ubuntu systems. Specifically, the script, due to a Debian patch, was loading libraries from the current working directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Untrusted Search Path:** The primary vulnerability is an untrusted search path. The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` was not explicitly set to only trusted directories, and included the current working directory.
*   **Insecure `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` Configuration:** The `/usr/bin/couchdb` script was setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in a manner that made the current working directory part of the library search path. This is generally discouraged due to the security implications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution. By placing a malicious shared library within a directory and tricking an administrator into executing the `/usr/bin/couchdb` script from that directory, the malicious library would be loaded and executed as part of the CouchDB process, which is equivalent to privilege escalation in many cases.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **Exploitation via `couchdb` Script:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `/usr/bin/couchdb` script is executed directly from a directory controlled by the attacker. The vulnerability is not triggered by the init script (/etc/init.d/couchdb) because the init script changes the current directory before launching CouchDB.
*   **Malicious Shared Library:** An attacker would need to create a malicious shared library and place it in a directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where CouchDB is installed.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write to a directory that can be used to launch the vulnerable script from.
*   **Social Engineering (or similar):** The attacker needs to trick an administrator or another user with sufficient privileges into executing the `/usr/bin/couchdb` script from a directory that the attacker controls.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was introduced by a Debian patch.
*   The issue was present in the `icu-config.patch` in Debian stable, which caused the same issue as `mozjs1.9_ldlibpath.patch` in Ubuntu.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by removing the insecure LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting.
*   The affected versions included CouchDB 0.8.0 on Debian and Ubuntu systems with the vulnerable patches.
