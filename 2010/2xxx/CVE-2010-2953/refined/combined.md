Subject: Hardening the linker (was Re: CVE request: CouchDB insecure library loading (Debian/Ubuntu only))

For those of you that missed it, this was actually reported by Dan off the back
of a blog post by me describing the generic case:

<http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/blog.php?id=87>

I'm well aware that the linker is a tool and that it can be misused (as in
this case) but is anyone aware of a good reason why empty directory
specifications in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH et al are treated as $PWD?  The only
times I've seen empty specifications it's because of bugs such as the one Dan
has reported.

Is there a case to look at harding the dynamic linker to reject empty
specifications; there's not much that one can do where someone has explicitly
set a stupid LD_LIBRARY_PATH?  I appreciate that this might has some unwanted
outcomes (such as breaking compatibility with other POSIX-alike OS) but
sometimes there's a good argument for breaking compatibility if it increases
security (some of the various grsec kernel and GCC compiler hardening changes
would be good examples here).

Date: Wed, 25 Aug 2010 14:52:52 -0400
From: Dan Rosenberg <dan.j.rosenberg@gmail.com>
Subject: [oss-security] CVE request: CouchDB insecure library loading (Debian/Ubuntu only)

I discovered that the /usr/bin/couchdb script on Debian/Ubuntu sets an
insecure LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, such that libraries
from the current directory are loaded.  If a local attacker placed a
maliciously crafted shared library in a directory and an administrator
were tricked into launching CouchDB from this directory, arbitrary
code execution could be achieved.  This vulnerability is only
triggered when the /usr/bin/couchdb script is executed explicitly,
since the init script (/etc/init.d/couchdb) changes the current
directory before launching CouchDB.

The vulnerability was introduced by Debian patch
"mozjs1.9_ldlibpath.patch" on 3/24/2009.

Cheers,
       Moritz

 I fail to find this patch neither in the lenny package nor in the
squeeze package, and there was no changelog entry or upload around the
mentioned time. Are you sure about these fineprints?

 Thanks in advance,
Rhonda

 Alright, after some chat with Moritz and other security people I better
understand the issue, the patch icu-config.patch in the lenny package
also has the problem, it would depend on an already set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable. In the case it isn't set (which is the default) it
has the insecure behavior depending on the current directory.

 A test for existence of the variable should be done and depending on
that either get extended or explicitly set only to the variable. I
though question the need of the patch - /usr/lib is searched by default
anyway? What's the background of that? I didn't find any hint in the
changelog - and that's one of the reasons why a comment in the patch
file would be really helpful. :)

 Thanks!
Rhonda

This patch does not seem to be included in current Debian stable
0.8.0-2 and testing/unstable 0.11.0-2+b1 packages, but can be found in
Ubuntu versions.

Stable Debian contains icu-config.patch instead which seems to
introduce the very same problem and is also used in some Fedora
packages:

Package        : couchdb
Vulnerability  : untrusted search path
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2010-2953
Debian Bug     : 594412

Dan Rosenberg discovered that in couchdb, a distributed,
fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database, an insecure
library search path is used; a local attacker could execute arbitrary
code by first dumping a maliciously crafted shared library in some
directory, and then having an administrator run couchdb from this same
directory.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.0-2+lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your couchdb package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
