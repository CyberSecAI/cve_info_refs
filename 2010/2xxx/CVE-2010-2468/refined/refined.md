The provided content is related to vulnerabilities in Electronic Door Access Control (EDAC) systems, specifically the S2 Security NetBox, but it does not directly mention CVE-2010-2468. Therefore, I will respond with information extracted regarding the vulnerabilities mentioned in the provided text.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from a combination of outdated software, insecure configurations, and poor security practices in the design and deployment of the S2 Security NetBox system. This includes the use of vulnerable HTTP server software, outdated database software, and cleartext protocols for communication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Outdated GoAhead Webserver:** The NetBox uses the GoAhead webserver which is known to have multiple CVEs (CVE-2003-1568, CVE-2002-2431, CVE-2002-2430, CVE-2002-2429, CVE-2002-2428, CVE-2002-1951). These are left unpatched due to lack of vendor response.
*   **Outdated MySQL:** Older versions (2.X) of the NetBox use the very outdated MySQL version 4.0.
*   **Unauthenticated Reset:** The system has an unauthenticated reset vulnerability (VU#571629).
*   **Unauthenticated Access to Backups:** An unauthenticated attacker can download database backups (VU#228737). These backups contain sensitive information, such as administrator credentials and configuration details. Backups are created via a hardcoded CRON job with predictable filenames. The database contains usernames, passwords, and facility diagrams.
*   **Cleartext Protocols:** The system uses FTP and Telnet, which transmit data in cleartext, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping.
*   **Predictable Backup Filenames:** The backup filenames follow a predictable naming convention, making them easily discoverable.
*    **Poor documentation:** Security-oriented documentation is poor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain full control of the NetBox system.
*   **Door Control:** An attacker can open any door controlled by the system.
*   **Access to Sensitive Data:** The attacker gains access to the entire system database, including user credentials, facility information, and IP camera details.
*   **IP Camera Compromise:** The attacker can compromise IP cameras connected to the system, gaining access to live video feeds.
*   **DVR Compromise:** The attacker can compromise DVRs connected to the system, as the backup database contains usernames/passwords for them.
*   **Exposure of PII** The system stores personal information of personnel with access credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is via the network, exploiting vulnerabilities in the NetBox's web interface, database server, or communication protocols.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Several vulnerabilities can be exploited without requiring authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the NetBox system.
*   **Basic Networking Skills:** Exploiting the vulnerabilities requires basic understanding of network protocols.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** Exploiting the webserver requires the ability to craft HTTP requests.
*    **Ability to Reverse Engineer** Exploiting the backup requires ability to uncompress the .dar format.
*   **Ability to Crack Hashes:** Exploiting the admin password requires the ability to crack a MySQL 64bit hash.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content highlights a lack of security awareness and practices in the deployment and maintenance of EDAC systems.
*   The vendor, S2 Security, is criticized for not responding to vulnerability reports in a timely manner and using outdated technology.
*   The content notes that the devices are often managed by building facilities personnel, who may lack adequate IT security expertise.
*   The content suggests isolating EDAC systems on separate VLANs, using MAC authentication, VPNs, and other technical measures.
