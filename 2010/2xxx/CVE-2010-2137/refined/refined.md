{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in `include` statements.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple File Inclusion (LFI/RFI) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files, leading to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) or Local File Inclusion (LFI). RFI allows the execution of arbitrary code from a remote server, while LFI allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the `page` GET parameter for RFI and the `_SESSION[userLang]` parameter for LFI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, including the ability to manipulate GET parameters. No authentication is required."
