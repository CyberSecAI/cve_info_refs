Hash: SHA1

This is a security and bugfix release of MediaWiki 1.16.0 and
MediaWiki 1.15.5. Download links are given at the end of this email.

A data leakage vulnerability was discovered, affecting MediaWiki 1.8
and later. Public caching headers were incorrectly set on API
responses containing private data. By means of a CSRF-style attack,
this can lead to the disclosure of various types of private data
stored on a wiki. All users are advised to upgrade. Full details can
be found at:

<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24565>

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in
profileinfo.php. The vulnerability is only exposed when the script is
explicitly enabled in LocalSettings.php, with $wgEnableProfileInfo = true.

A register_globals arbitrary inclusion vulnerability was discovered in
the 1.16 beta release series, in MediaWikiParserTest.php. This
vulnerability does not affect any stable MediaWiki release. It only
affects wikis which have PHP's register_globals feature enabled,
despite our strong advice to the contrary. Apache installations with
AllowOverride enabled may be protected against this vulnerability,
since there is a .htaccess file with "Deny from all" in the relevant path.

In both releases, the interface text was updated with new translations
from translatewiki.net.

Upgrade FAQ:
[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:FAQ#Upgrading](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual%3AFAQ#Upgrading)

**********************************************************************

We are proud to announce the first stable release of the 1.16 series.
Selected changes that may be of interest since MediaWiki 1.15 are:

* Watchlists now have RSS/Atom feeds. RSS feeds generally are now
hidden, since Atom is a better protocol and is supported by virtually
all clients.

* It's now possible to block users from sending email via
Special:Emailuser.

* The maintenance script system was overhauled. Most maintenance
scripts now have a useful help page when you run them with --help.

* AdminSettings.php is no longer required in order to run maintenance
scripts. You can just set $wgDBadminuser and $wgDBadminpassword in
your LocalSettings.php instead.

* The preferences system was overhauled. Preferences are stored in a
more compact format. Changes to site default preferences will
automatically affect all users who have not chosen a different preference.

* Support for SQLite was improved. Some broken features were fixed,
and it now has an efficient full-text search.

* The user groups ACL system was improved by allowing rights to be
revoked, instead of just granted.

* A new localisation caching system was introduced, which will make
MediaWiki faster for almost everyone, especially when lots of
extensions are enabled.

By default, this new system makes a lot of database queries. If your
database is particularly slow, or if your system administrator limits
your query count, or if you want to squeeze as much performance as
possible out of Mediawiki, set $wgCacheDirectory to a writable path on
the local filesystem. Make sure you have the DBA extension for PHP
installed, this will improve performance further.

I spy three flaws:

    A data leakage vulnerability was discovered, affecting MediaWiki 1.8
    and later. Public caching headers were incorrectly set on API
    responses containing private data. By means of a CSRF-style attack,
    this can lead to the disclosure of various types of private data
    stored on a wiki. All users are advised to upgrade. Full details can
    be found at:

    <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24565>

Use CVE-2010-2787

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in
    profileinfo.php. The vulnerability is only exposed when the script is
    explicitly enabled in LocalSettings.php, with $wgEnableProfileInfo = true.

Use CVE-2010-2788

    A register_globals arbitrary inclusion vulnerability was discovered in
    the 1.16 beta release series, in MediaWikiParserTest.php. This
    vulnerability does not affect any stable MediaWiki release. It only
    affects wikis which have PHP's register_globals feature enabled,
    despite our strong advice to the contrary. Apache installations with
    AllowOverride enabled may be protected against this vulnerability,
    since there is a .htaccess file with "Deny from all" in the relevant path.

Use CVE-2010-2789

Thank.

(In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=620226#c2)) > There are still no details on the nature of these CVEs in neither mitre nor > nvd. The status in mitre is "reserved, under review" and nvd return an error on > these CVEs.  Below is the copy of the email / query I sent to Tim Starling regarding patches clarification (you were Cc-ed): =======================================  Hello Tim,    based on query from Axel below:   "There are still no details on the nature of these CVEs in neither mitre nor    nvd. The status in mitre is "reserved, under review" and nvd return an error    on these CVEs."  searched for patches for the following two mediawiki flaws: [1] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=620224](show_bug.cgi?id=620224 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2787 MediaWiki (< v1.15.5, v1.16.0): Private data leakage via public caching headers") [2] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=620225](show_bug.cgi?id=620225 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2788 MediaWiki (< v1.15.5, v1.16.0): XSS in profileinfo.php")  in the Mediawiki upstream SVN repository: [3] <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download_from_SVN>  and based on the log found the following: 1), the upstream patch for [CVE-2010-2787](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2787) seems to be the following:     [4] <http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki?view=revision&revision=69776> 2), and upstream patches for [CVE-2010-2788](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2788) seem to be the following two:     [5] <http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki?view=revision&revision=69952> and     [6] <http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki?view=revision&revision=69984>  But prior providing this information to Axel, so he could build the Fedora mediawiki updates, wanted to check with you.  Tim, could you please confirm, the [4], [5], and [6] are the correct upstream Mediawiki patches for [CVE-2010-2787](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2787) and [CVE-2010-2788](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2788) flaws, so Axel could build the updates?

# Description

The API (api.php) in previous versions of MediaWiki sends private cache headers by default for almost all API operations, but allows public cache headers to be sent if they are requested via URL or POST data parameters. We have discovered that this policy allows leakage of private data, if an attacker can access the wiki through the same caching HTTP proxy as the victim user.

A user's browser can be tricked into requesting private data with public caching headers, via a CSRF-style attack on an external web page. The attacker would cause the victim's browser to request private data with public caching headers, then the attacker would download the same data from the intermediate HTTP proxy, bypassing access controls.

The kinds of things that may be leaked by this bug are:

* Article titles and contents (if these are restricted)
* The contents of deleted articles
* User email addresses
* User watchlists

The following types of data are not affected and cannot be leaked by this bug:

* User passwords
* Session IDs
* The contents of uploaded files

The main mitigating factor is the need for an HTTP proxy to be shared between the victim and the attacker. However, we believe that some hosting providers use caching HTTP proxies to improve performance, without informing their users that they are doing so. Thus we advise all MediaWiki users to upgrade, unless they control both the server and the network path to the wiki's users, and are convinced that there are no HTTP proxies on that network path.

Our fix will be included in MediaWiki 1.15.5 and 1.16.0. The following versions are affected:

* All versions from MediaWiki 1.8 to 1.14. Note that in MediaWiki 1.8, the API was disabled by default, this would mitigate the attack.
* MediaWiki 1.15.0 to 1.15.4.
* All beta versions in the MediaWiki 1.16 series.

Our fix is comprehensive: it disables public caching for all API modules except those which explicitly declare their data to be public. On private wikis, all responses will be marked private.

**Version**: 1.15.x

**Severity**: major
