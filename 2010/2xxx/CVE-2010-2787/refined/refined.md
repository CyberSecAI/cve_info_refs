Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The MediaWiki API incorrectly sets public caching headers on responses containing private data. This allows for the possibility of intermediary HTTP proxies caching this data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect public caching headers on API responses containing private data.
- Vulnerability to CSRF-style attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of various types of private data stored on a wiki, including:
    - Restricted article titles and content
    - Contents of deleted articles
    - User email addresses
    - User watchlists
- Bypassing of access controls via intermediary HTTP proxies.
- Data leakage to unauthorized parties.

**Attack vectors:**
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) style attacks on external web pages.
- Tricking a user's browser into requesting private data with public caching headers.
- Exploiting shared HTTP proxies between victim and attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to cause a victim's browser to make an API request with public caching headers.
- Shared access to an intermediate HTTP proxy with the victim user.
- Knowledge of the MediaWiki API to make specific requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects MediaWiki versions 1.8 through 1.15.4 and all beta versions in the 1.16 series.
- MediaWiki 1.8 has a mitigating factor as the API was disabled by default.
- The fix disables public caching for all API modules except those which explicitly declare their data to be public, marking all responses as private on private wikis.
- The information provided details a more comprehensive explanation of the vulnerability than is available in the initial CVE description.
