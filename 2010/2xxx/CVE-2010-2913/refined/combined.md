### DO NOT get this! DO NOT!!!

> We have two accounts and have been with CITI for over 12 years. Every month, we go online and pay both accounts through our separate payment account. Then tried to use this app. Could not link, so we called technical support. Finally got one account activated before leaving on trip. The following day, before departure, we tried to pay both accounts. By setting up the mobile app, both accounts became unlinked, as well as the payment information. After well over an hour online with a rep that could only read from a script (she did not listen to our problem), she said that the account was pending and to try back in 24-48 hrs and enter in the information again. How is that pending as we are redoing the process? So we leave and the day after we get home, we go through the process again. After even more hours on the phone with tech support, then customer service (I was steamed), only to be switched back the tech support (who tried to help but was unsuccessful), we were told that a ticket would be written and we could expect an email to resolve the issue. Every time we were talking with tech support, they could only walk us through the same steps. As a work around, we have had to establish two separate accounts AND now have them sending us two separate paper statements so that they could get paid. Waiting to see the email to see if this is resolved, otherwise, we are canceling our accounts.

### Fixed Now

> They fixed it, updating to five stars.
>
> ---
> I've used this app for years and it's done me well but I got a new phone (iPhone SE) a couple weeks and the app is a pain now to use to the point of being totally useless. It no longer offers me the option for a Thumbprint sign in. And if I try to sign in manually via my saved password I get stuck in a loop because it won't fill in both the password and user login. At this point in order to access my account I've just memorized my complicated password. I input both that and my user manually (in the correct order or each time you fill in one the other will get deleted). I've tried restarting and making sure my app is up to date. I've compared the app on my new and old phone and on my old phone there is definitely the Thumbprint option both on the sign in page and under options in the security section. The app on my new phone doesn't show these options. And please, don't even think about using the stupid quick view or snap shot or whatever it's called, it will create even more trouble for you when you try to sign in. I'll update my review when the issue is fixed. When the app was working before it was my favorite cc app.

### Almost there

> I love the app and how simple it is to navigate the features, including the free updates on your credit score. You can also live chat with someone during regular working hours, itâs great! My only reason for giving it a 4 out of 5 would be customer service and miscommunication. I had a fraud alert early August. They notified me quickly to go over the charges and so forth. They closed my account immediately and communicated that a replacement would be on its way. Not stating as to when it would arrive, but soon. Itâs already been more than two weeks and this shopaholic is experiencing credit withdrawals. I am very much accustomed to a certain company that will fed ex your replacement within two days! I called and asked about the shipment , one month USPS. Iâm over here like.... âYou guys obviously donât want me to spend?â Whatâs a girl gotta do to get this envelope?! Losing my patience and most definitely contemplating a switch. This con so far is outweighing the pros. On another note, they need to reconsider the quality of their Costco Citi Visa. The sides fringe after use. It looks like they plastered a sticker on their that might easily peel off.
