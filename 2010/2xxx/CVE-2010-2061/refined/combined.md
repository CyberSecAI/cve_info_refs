### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Package: rpcbind
Version: 0.2.0-4
Severity: serious

Hi!

The rpcbind daemon, which runs as root, uses /tmp/portmap.xdr and
/tmp/rpcbind.xdr for doing warm starts as what seems to be a way to
preserve state between invokations. It parses (through libtirpc) and
removes them on start. It creates them before exiting.

So first off, *any* user can craft those two files before the daemon
has started for the first time, which the daemon will parse. This might
be ok, depending on the checks done on parse, I'd still be very wary of
letting a user be able to craft such files at will.

The second problem is that those files get created by the daemon on
shutdown, and they *do* follow symlinks. So a user can drop two symlinks
there while the daemon is running and overwrite any file on the file
system on shutdown.

The fix would consist of passing to configure something like
“--with-statedir=/var/cache/rpcbind”, and make sure the daemon creates
such directory if missing on exit in src/warmstart.c:write_struct(),
which it does not seem to be doing currently.

In addition it would be wise to notify upstream to change the default
statedir to something else than /tmp.

thanks,
guillem

It seems to be doing no checks whatsoever. A simple test I performed at
the time of filing this report, but didn't seem to have any obvious
consequence, shows this which I noticed later on:

,---
gaara:~# /etc/init.d/rpcbind start
Starting rpcbind daemon....
gaara:~# ps axuOp|egrep '(^USER|[r]pcbind)'
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND

`---

The first start is a normal clean invokation, the second one is using
the crafted file. See how it has allocated almost 4 GiB. Disregard though,
me running all this as root, a user would be able to craft those files as
long as they were not already in /tmp.

thanks,
guillem

I'm adding here part of the initial mail that I trimmed when replying
to myself:

The second problem is that those files get created by the daemon on
shutdown, and they *do* follow symlinks. So a user can drop two
symlinks
there while the daemon is running and overwrite any file on the file
system on shutdown.

The fix would consist of passing to configure something like
“--with-statedir=/var/cache/rpcbind”, and make sure the daemon creates
such directory if missing on exit in src/warmstart.c:write_struct(),
which it does not seem to be doing currently.

In addition it would be wise to notify upstream to change the default
statedir to something else than /tmp.

/var/run might not be preserved across reboots, but regardless of that I
think /var/cache is a better fit, it's internal state, but it's used
to speed up start up time, and can be removed w/o ill effects.

Agree changing the upstream default is a good idea.

Generally, that kind of directory is created as part of installation
(like, by rpm --install) rather than by the daemon itself.

No, it's not intended to speed start up.

The cache files aren't really supposed to be retained over a reboot.
After a system restart, all of the RPC services will restart and
register themselves again.  If just rpcbind restarts, all that
registration state is lost, so that's the point of saving it in a file.

I don't have a preference wrt /var/run or /var/cache.

At least for /var/run I think it's common for systems to mount it
as tmpfs, so the directories might not be there on boot. But those can
always be created by the init script (or equivalent), it might be a
problem if run from inetd though.

Ah, yeah that makes more sense! More so given the configure option, I
should have written "AFAIS" or something like that. :)

> I don't have a preference wrt /var/run or /var/cache.

So given that this is actually run time state, /var/run seems more
appropriate, indeed.

Would /var/run (or a subdirectory of it) be a better choice than /tmp ?

Hi Steve, vendors,

  Guillem Jover pointed out:
  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583435#5>

a deficiency in the way rpcbind gathered / saved registrations from / to
dumped file(s). A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic
link attacks, leading to un-authorized disclosure of sensitive information
and / or to important system files data integrity corruption.

References:

Could you allocate CVE id for this?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=599697#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 19:00:42 UTC  ``` Guillem Jover pointed out:   [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583435#5>  a deficiency in the way rpcbind gathered / saved registrations from / to dumped file(s). A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, leading to un-authorized disclosure of sensitive information and / or to important system files data integrity corruption.  CVE Request:   [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/06/03/4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=599697#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 19:13:06 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the rpcbind package, as shipped with Fedora release of 11, 12, and 13.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=599697#c5)  Steve Dickson    2010-06-03 23:44:37 UTC  ``` So what is the answer here... do we need to add some type encryption or simply change where the file lives...   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=599697#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-09 04:02:52 UTC  ``` The name [CVE-2010-2061](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2061) has been assigned for the "any user can craft those two files before the daemon has started for the first time, which the daemon will parse".  The name [CVE-2010-2064](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2064) has been assigned to the "symlinks are followed on creation of those files".  As noted: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/06/08/3>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=599697#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-24 13:17:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=599697#c1)) > This issue affects the versions of the rpcbind package, as shipped > with Fedora release of 11, 12, and 13.  This issue did not affect those Fedora versions, it's quite possible Fedora was never affected, or was only affected for a short time long ago.  Looking at the Fedora rpcbind.spec, it contains:    RPCBDIR=/var/lib/rpcbind    [ ... ]       --with-statedir="$RPCBDIR" \  This changes location of those two files form default /tmp to safe /var/lib/rpcbind (directory is not group writeable).  I checked (strings on rpcbind) current and older (from F-8) builds and they use files form /var/lib/rpcbind.  Here is the patch that added support for specifying state dir location via configure, and it also add --with-statedir to .spec file:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=rpcbind.git;a=commitdiff;h=5af042e80a1b86c0ca2b746a520f3a5b34be2d1d>   ``` |  |
