Vincent Danen      2010-08-09 17:44:43 EDT

An out-of-range flaw was found in znc where if it received a "PING" from a
client without an argument, std::string would throw a std::out_of_range
exception which killed znc.  This is fixed in subversion [[1]](#1).

Some unsafe substr() calls were fixed as well.  These are of lesser impact
because a valid login is required in order to cause a std::out_of_range
exception.  This is also fixed in subversion [[2]](#2).
