Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2694:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `pid` parameter of the `com_redshop` component in Joomla!.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `pid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to:
    - Retrieve sensitive information (e.g., user credentials, product data)
    - Modify or delete data
    - Potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server, depending on the database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page.
- The attacker manipulates the `pid` parameter within the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application. No special privileges are needed.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable URL pattern.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is: `http://127.0.0.1/[path]/index.php?option=com_redshop&view=product&pid=[SQLi]`
- The `[SQLi]` part should be replaced with malicious SQL code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable software is the `redSHOP` component for Joomla!, version 1.0 and possibly lower versions.
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerability allows for arbitrary SQL injection and is remotely exploitable via web requests.
