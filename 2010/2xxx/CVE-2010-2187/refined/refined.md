      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Adobe Flash Player.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted SWF file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted SWF file.",
