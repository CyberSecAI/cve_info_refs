Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-2478:

*   **Vulnerability:** Kernel buffer overflow in the Linux kernel's `ethtool` interface, specifically within the `ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL` command.
*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow when calculating the buffer size needed for the `ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL` command. On a 32-bit machine, if `info.rule_cnt` is greater than or equal to `0x40000000`, it leads to an integer overflow. This results in a buffer that is smaller than required.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using the unprivileged `ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL` ioctl call with a large `info.rule_cnt` value.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (crashing the system). Privilege escalation may be possible, though not explicitly stated.
*   **Affected Versions:** Introduced in v2.6.27-rc1 via commit `0853ad66` and affects kernels with the Neptune Ethernet (niu) driver.
*   **Fixed Versions:** 2.6.35, 2.6.34.2, 2.6.33.7 and 2.6.32.17
