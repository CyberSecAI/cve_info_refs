Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2066:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `MOVE_EXT` ioctl for the ext4 filesystem in the Linux kernel. This ioctl allows moving file extents (data blocks) from one file to another. The root cause is that the kernel does not correctly check permissions on the *donor* file before performing this move.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The core weakness is the lack of proper permission checks on the donor file when using the `MOVE_EXT` ioctl. Specifically, it doesn't verify if the user has write access to the donor file.
*   **Bypass of append-only restriction:** The vulnerability allows a local attacker to bypass the append-only file permission, which is designed to prevent modifications to a file except appending new data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Loss/Corruption:** A local attacker can overwrite the contents of an append-only file by using `MOVE_EXT` ioctl, leading to potential data loss or corruption.
*  **Integrity Violation:** Overwriting an append-only file violates the integrity of data that is meant to be immutable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the system where the vulnerable kernel and filesystem are running.
*   **ioctl Call:** The attacker would need to craft an ioctl call using `EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT` with a file as the source (donor) and a target file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to make ioctl calls:** The attacker needs the ability to make ioctl system calls.
*   **Knowledge of ext4 ioctl:** The attacker must be aware of the `EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT` ioctl and how to use it.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Reported by Dan Rosenberg:** The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Dan Rosenberg.
*   **Upstream Fix:** The fix was committed to the upstream Linux kernel repository
*   **Affected Filesystems:** The vulnerability specifically affects ext4 filesystems.
*   **Not in RHEL 3,4,MRG:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and MRG were not affected as they did not have ext4 support.
*   **Fixed in various Linux distros:** Patches were released for various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, SUSE, and Red Hat.
*   **VMWare impact:** The VMSA-2011-0003 advisory indicated that VMware ESX had a fix for this issue in the service console kernel.

In summary, CVE-2010-2066 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem that allows an attacker to overwrite the contents of append-only files through the MOVE_EXT ioctl due to missing permission checks.
