Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure default file permissions assigned to the `prewikka.conf` configuration file during the installation of Prewikka. This file contains the SQL database password used by Prewikka.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The `prewikka.conf` file was created with world-readable permissions, allowing any local user to read its contents.
*   **Cleartext Password Storage:** The SQL database password was stored in plaintext within the configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
*   **Obtain Database Credentials:** Gain access to the SQL database password used by Prewikka,
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Potentially gain unauthorized access to the Prewikka database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have a user account on the affected system to access the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where Prewikka is installed.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker requires the ability to read files on the local filesystem, specifically the vulnerable `prewikka.conf` file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions of Prewikka prior to 0.9.14-r2
*   The fix involved changing the file permissions of `prewikka.conf` to be readable only by the web server user group.
*   The Gentoo bug tracker entry ([https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=270056](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=270056)) provides a detailed timeline of the bug report and fix.
