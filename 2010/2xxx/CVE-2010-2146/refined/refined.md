Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `banned.php` file of the Visitor Logger application. Specifically, the `VL_include_path` parameter is directly used in an `include()` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability. The application uses a user-controlled parameter, `VL_include_path`, to include files. Because of this, an attacker can include a remote file by manipulating the `VL_include_path` parameter in a request to `banned.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. The included file could contain PHP code designed to compromise the server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the permissions of the webserver process, successful exploitation can lead to full control of the server, potentially allowing an attacker to access sensitive data or use it as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `banned.php` script.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The `VL_include_path` parameter in the query string is used to inject the malicious file location. For example, an attacker could use a URL like: `http://[target].com/[logger_path]/banned.php?VL_include_path=[SHELLCODE]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious file that they can include via the `VL_include_path` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit example suggests using a "c99-shellcode". This implies the attacker is expected to include a PHP file that contains malicious code, not necessarily shellcode.
*   The vulnerable code is located within the `banned.php` file, specifically at lines three and four.
*   The application vendor is `graviton-mediatech.com`.
*   The vulnerable application is called "Visitor Logger" and can be found at the specified download URL.

**Summary:**

The identified vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion in the `banned.php` script of the Visitor Logger application. An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code through the `VL_include_path` parameter, potentially leading to full system compromise.
