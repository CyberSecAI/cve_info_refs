Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2366:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a specific method used by Access Analyzer CGI to embed tags into web pages, which allows for cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input when embedding tags, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary scripts into web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted web request or by injecting malicious code into the tag embedding process.
- Network-based attacks are possible since the application can be accessed over the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the tag embedding process.
- No authentication is needed for exploitation.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into viewing the malicious webpage.

**Affected Products:**
- futomi Co.,Ltd. Access Analyzer CGI Professional Version
- futomi Co.,Ltd. Access Analyzer CGI Standard Version 4.0.2 and earlier

**Additional details from JVN:**
- JPCERT/CC assessment indicates:
    - High Access Required (attack over the internet)
    - High Authentication (no authentication required)
    - Medium User Interaction Required (user needs to click on a link)
    - High Exploit Complexity (user must be tricked into taking action)

This information provides more detail than the basic CVE description, particularly about the specifics of the attack vector and the required user interaction.
