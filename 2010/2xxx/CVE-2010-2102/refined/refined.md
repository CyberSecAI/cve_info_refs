  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Webby WebServer due to insufficient bounds checking when handling HTTP GET requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow",
    "SEH overwrite"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the server. The SEH overwrite could potentially allow an attacker to gain control of the program execution flow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request with an overly long URI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed."
