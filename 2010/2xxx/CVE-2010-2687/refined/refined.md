Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `printdetail.asp` script of the "Boat Classifieds" application. Specifically, the `Id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `Id` parameter before using it in an SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Access to sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., user information, classified listings, etc.).
    - Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of data in the database.
    - Potential takeover of the application or underlying server, depending on database privileges.
    - Denial of service, by crashing the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `printdetail.asp` script.
- An attacker can inject SQL code via the `Id` parameter in the URL.
- Example of attack: `http://localhost/[path]/printdetail.asp?Id=661 and 1=1` and `http://localhost/[path]/printdetail.asp?Id=661 and 1=2`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application server.
- No prior authentication seems necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit-db entry shows examples of basic SQL injection tests.
- The vulnerable application is named "Boat Classifieds," available from the specified URL.
- The application is built with ASP.
