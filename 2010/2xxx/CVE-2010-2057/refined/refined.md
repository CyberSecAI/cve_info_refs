Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue lies in the way Apache MyFaces (and Mojarra) handles encrypted view states. It encrypts the state but **does not include a Message Authentication Code (MAC)**. This absence of a MAC allows for padding oracle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing MAC:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to include a MAC with the encrypted view state.
*   **Padding Oracle Attack:** The lack of a MAC makes the system vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. This type of attack could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the encrypted view state.
*   **Side-channel timing attack:** There was also a secondary issue related to a side-channel timing attack in the StateUtils class, which further exacerbated the padding oracle vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **View State Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to modify the view state. This could potentially lead to unauthorized actions, data modification, or other unintended behavior within the application.
*   **ViewExpiredException:** The system is designed to throw `ViewExpiredException` if a modified view state is detected, but it is a side-effect of failed MAC verification after the fix is implemented, not a symptom of the vulnerability itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could intercept the encrypted view state as it travels between the client and server.
*   **Tampering:** The attacker can then attempt to modify the intercepted encrypted view state.
*   **Padding Oracle:** By repeatedly sending modified view states and observing server responses, the attacker can decrypt and manipulate the view state.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
*   **Understanding of Cryptography:** A successful attack would require an understanding of padding oracle attacks.
*   **Targeted Web Application:** The attacker needs to target a web application using a vulnerable version of Apache MyFaces that is using encrypted view states.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated by adding MAC to the encrypted state, which involves new parameters: `org.apache.myfaces.MAC_ALGORITHM`, `org.apache.myfaces.MAC_SECRET`, and `org.apache.myfaces.MAC_SECRET.CACHE`.
*   The fix uses an Encrypt-then-MAC approach (EtM).
*   The issue was fixed in Apache MyFaces versions 1.1.8, 1.2.9, and 2.0.1.
*   The bug report notes that server-side state saving is not vulnerable to the described attack, because the view state only contains an identifier and no component tree data is exposed.
