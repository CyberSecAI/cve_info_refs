Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The btrfs filesystem in the Linux kernel did not properly check ownership of files before allowing users to set Access Control Lists (ACLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Access Control Check:** The core vulnerability was the absence of an ownership check when setting ACLs.
- **Bypass of File Permissions:** This flaw allowed any user to modify the ACLs of any file, regardless of their ownership or permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete File Permission Bypass:** An attacker could completely circumvent normal file permission restrictions.
- **Unauthorized Access/Modification:** By manipulating ACLs, an attacker could grant themselves or others unauthorized access, modify, or delete files.
- **System Compromise:** Depending on the affected files, this could lead to various forms of privilege escalation and system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** This vulnerability required local access to the system.
- **Command Line Interface:** The attacker would use standard tools for setting ACLs, like `setfacl`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker only needs a valid user account on the affected system.
- **No elevated Privileges initially:** No root or administrative privileges are initially needed.

**Additional Details:**
- This issue was discovered by Shi Weihua, not reported initially as a security issue
- The vulnerability was considered serious and was assigned CVE-2010-2071
- The fix is available in the upstream commit at: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/2f26afba>
