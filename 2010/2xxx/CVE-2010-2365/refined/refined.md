- The attacker can be remote and does not require any special authentication or privilege.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious script and inject it into moobbs2 via input fields, comments, or similar.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the content containing the injected script, e.g. clicking a link, viewing the bulletin board.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is present in moobbs2 version 1.02 and earlier.
- The severity is considered "High" in terms of access and authentication but "Mid" for user interaction needed and "High" for exploit complexity, per JPCERT analysis.
