Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-2542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overrun vulnerability exists in how Git sanitizes the path of a git directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability is a buffer overrun, meaning that a specially crafted input can write data past the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting other memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Git command.
- Denial of Service: If Git is compiled with stack-protecting flags (like on Fedora), the vulnerability is mitigated to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Git Working Copy: An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Git working copy.
- Local Attack: The attacker must have local access to the system to create the malicious working copy.
- Tricking User: The attacker must trick a local user into running any Git command within the malicious working copy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs to be able to create files and directories on the target system.
- Social Engineering (or other method) to induce user to run a git command in the attacker's crafted directory

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Git version 1.5.6 and fixed in 1.7.2.
- The vulnerability affects systems where a user might execute Git commands within a repository controlled by a malicious user, leading to potential code execution or denial of service.
- Red Hat bug tracker indicates the issue is resolved by an upstream fix.
- The issue also affected cgit which bundles a copy of git. A patch was applied to the copy of git within cgit rather than upgrading to a newer version of cgit.
