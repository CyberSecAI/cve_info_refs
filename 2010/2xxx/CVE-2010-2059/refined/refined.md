Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2010-2059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure in the `rpm` package manager to properly clear the SUID/SGID bits of old files during a package upgrade. This means that if an older version of an executable had these bits set, they could remain set even after the package was updated, potentially leading to privilege escalation. Additionally, similar issues exist with the handling of POSIX file capabilities and SELinux contexts during upgrades. These attributes were not cleared when an older version of an executable was replaced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Preservation of Permissions:** During a package upgrade, `rpm` does not remove the SUID/SGID bits from the older version of an executable being replaced.
- **Inadequate Handling of File Capabilities:** POSIX file capabilities associated with older versions are also not cleared on upgrade.
- **Inadequate Handling of SELinux Contexts:** SELinux contexts of older versions are not cleared on upgrade.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retain access to older, potentially vulnerable executables with elevated privileges. This can be achieved by creating a hard link to the older executable before it is replaced during an upgrade or by accessing the old file via /proc/self/fd.
- **Persistence of Vulnerabilities:** Even after updating a vulnerable package, an attacker could still execute the older vulnerable binary with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Hard Links:** The attacker creates a hard link to a setuid or setgid executable before it's replaced during a package upgrade. The attacker can then execute the old binary with elevated privileges via this hard link.
- **File Descriptors:** An attacker can open a vulnerable setuid/setgid executable, then execute it using the /proc/self/fd interface.
- **Filesystem Resurrection**: On some filesystems the attacker can resurrect the file using linkat(2) with AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW, even after the file has been replaced.
- **Package Upgrade:** This vulnerability is specifically triggered during a package upgrade operation performed by `rpm`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system.
- **Basic File System Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of how to create hard links, use /proc/self/fd, and be aware of specific filesystem behavior.
- **Privileged User (to trigger the upgrade):**  The attacker does not need root access initially but will benefit from having root access to trigger a package update.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of `rpm` shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (3, 4, and 5) and Fedora (11, 12, and 13).
- The POSIX file capability issue affects Fedora releases 11-13, but it is noted that the feature is not commonly used by packages in these versions.
- The original report and fix for this issue dates back to 2005 in a previous bug report ([bug #125517](show_bug.cgi?id=125517)). The fix was not fully implemented in the main code and reintroduced with later versions.
- The vulnerability is addressed in RHSA-2010:0678 and RHSA-2010:0679.
- OpenSUSE security advisories also mention this CVE, indicating it affects several of their releases as well.
