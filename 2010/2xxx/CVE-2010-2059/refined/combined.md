At a low level of granularity, it can be overkill to distinguish between
closely-related flaw types.

The factor of concern here is that Red Hat bug 598775 suggests that the
first variant was committed to a changeset, but not the second.  I can't
(quickly) assess whether upstream committed changes for both variants, but
if there's only a commit for the first one (and a public release), then
maybe we consider these bugs as "almost-but-not-quite the same version"
and assign a separate CVE.

We also use time lag between disclosures as a splitter, but these were
more-or-less within a 24-hour period, which we typically treat as "same
day."

This is fuzzy on both vuln type and version... I defer to others who can
shed more insight on the question of whether these versions are different
enough.

The second part about POSIX file capabilities was realized shortly
afterwards while thinking of possible other similar cases, and has been
fixed too now:
<http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commitdiff;h=4d172a194addc49851e558ea390d3045894e3230>

To my knowledge no distro actually uses the file capability support in RPM
though.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.

arbitrary CTCP commands. (CVE-2010-2785)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- lftp
This update of lftp improves the filename handling of downloaded files
to avoid downloading arbitrary content to unexpected locations (like
.login). (CVE-2010-2251)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libpython2\_6-1\_0
This update of python has a copy of libxmlrpc that is vulnerable to
denial of service bugs that can occur while processing malformed XML
input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,

to a corrupted heap memory. This bug can be exploited remotely with a
crafted TIFF file to cause an application crash or probably to execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1411)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libvorbis
This update of libvorbis fixes a memory corruption while parsing OGG
files. This bug was exploitable by remote attackers to cause an
application crash and could probably be exploited to execute arbitrary
code.
CVE-2009-2663: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8: Resource Management Errors (CWE-399)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- lxsession
lxsession-logout did not properly lock the screen before suspending,
hibernating and switching between users which could allow attackers with
physical access to take control of the system to obtain sensitive infor-
mation and / or execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who is
currently logged in (CVE-2010-2532).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- mono-addon-bytefx-data-mysql/bytefx-data-mysql
Mono's ASP.NET implementation did not set the 'EnableViewStateMac'
property by default. Attackers could exploit that to conduct cross-
site-scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2010-1459)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- moodle

MIME type and the style sheet document is malformed,
which allows remote HTTP servers to obtain sensitive
information via a crafted document.
- CVE-2010-1993: Opera 9.52 does not properly handle an IFRAME element
with a mailto: URL in its SRC attribute, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via an HTML document with many IFRAME
elements.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS was prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities which could
allow remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code via
unspecified vectors. (CVE-2010-0438)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- popt
This update fixes the problem where RPM misses to clear the SUID/SGID
bit of old files during package updates. (CVE-2010-2059)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
This update of postgresql was pblished to fix several minor security
vulnerabilities:
- CVE-2010-1975: postgresql does not properly check privileges during
certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.
- CVE-2010-1169: Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures,
which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- python-mako
Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly
escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- vte
VTE was vulnerable to an old title set+query attack which could be used
by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2713).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- w3m
w3m did not handle embedded nul characters in the common name and in
subject alternative names of x509 certificates.
CVE-2010-2074 has been assigned to this issue.
This update also turns on verification of x509 certificates by default
which was not the case before.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- xmlrpc-c
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Maybe obvious and natural conclusion from previous post already, but Panu clarified
yet, similar deficiency holds for dealing with posix file capabilities and SELinux
contexts, i.e. they are not cleared after pkg upgrade. Not sure second CVE is needed
for this, but if one is enough, wanted to explicitly mention this, so it can be
described in the text of the CVE too.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c0)  Matt McCutchen    2010-06-02 02:37:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 418879](attachment.cgi?id=418879 "SRPM for testing this bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=418879&action=edit "SRPM for testing this bug") SRPM for testing this bug  Description of problem: When RPM replaces an executable, it does not clear the setuid and setgid bits of the old file.  Thus, if a user made a hard link to the old executable, he/she will still be able to run it with elevated privileges.  This is bad if it was replaced because it had a vulnerability.  The problem seems to occur only when executables are replaced, not when they are erased.  This is the same bug that was previously noted in dpkg: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=225692>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): rpm-4.8.0-14.fc13.x86_64  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Rebuild the attached SRPM twice, once with -D 'rel 1' and once with -D 'rel 2'. 2. mkdir /tmp/rpm-setuid-test 3. rpm -i rpm-setuid-test-0-1.fc13.$(rpm -E '%{_build_arch}').rpm 4. ln /usr/bin/rpm-setuid-test /tmp/rpm-setuid-test/ 5. rpm -U rpm-setuid-test-0-2.fc13.$(rpm -E '%{_build_arch}').rpm 6. ls -l /tmp/rpm-setuid-test/rpm-setuid-test  Actual results: The old executable is setuid.  Expected results: The old executable is not setuid.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c1)  Panu Matilainen    2010-06-02 05:04:52 UTC  ``` Ah, good catch.

Though the >     file capability support is NOT used in these rpm >     versions yet.      A slight correction/clarification: rpm in Fedora >= 11 comes with file capability packaging support enabled, but to my knowledge this feature is not /used/ by any packages in any distribution (Fedora or otherwise) yet.   Another twist is that the file capability support is a compile-time optional feature, and rpm will only be able to drop capabilities from hardlinks IFF capability support is enabled in rpm itself by --with-cap option to configure. Thus it's recommended that rpm is always built with --with-cap option on distributions with filesystem level support for POSIX file capabilities to enable rpm to drop capabilities potentially set by administrators/package scriptlets.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c17)  Michael Schröder    2010-06-04 09:42:12 UTC  ``` #14: Yes, all suse versions with have rpm >= 4.4.2.3 are vulnerable, too.

You reported the issue with a complete patch in bugzilla, at that point a wrong patch ending up in the rpm.org tree (years after the fact) is hardly your fault either.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c21)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-08 22:49:06 UTC  ``` See [bug #601955](show_bug.cgi?id=601955 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2198 rpm: fails to drop POSIX file capabilities on package upgrade or removal") for [CVE-2010-2198](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2198) (rpm: fails to drop POSIX file capabilities/SELinux context information on package upgrade or removal)  See [bug #601956](show_bug.cgi?id=601956 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2010-2199 rpm: fails to drop POSIX ACLs on package upgrade or removal") for [CVE-2010-2199](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2199) (rpm: fails to drop POSIX ACLs on package upgrade or removal)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c22)  Panu Matilainen    2010-06-09 09:10:25 UTC  ``` Err, this is getting rather mixed up.  The issues at hand are 1) RPM fails to drop SUID/SGID bits on package upgrade (and removal for rpm < 4.4.2.1) 2) RPM fails to drop POSIX file capabilities on package upgrade and removal, which is simply the more fine-grained analogue of case 1). This only affects systems with filesystem-level support for POSIX file capabilities.  IMO there's little point having separate CVE's for the cases but if we must ... at least lets get the descriptions straight. POSIX ACL's and SELinux contexts aren't involved as they dont have additional means to gain extra privileges through execution AFAICT.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c23)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-11 11:41:59 UTC  ``` rpm-4.8.1-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/rpm-4.8.1-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c24)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-11 12:35:17 UTC  ``` rpm-4.8.1-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/rpm-4.8.1-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c25)  Matt McCutchen    2010-06-11 20:11:26 UTC  ``` I realized that hard links are not the only way to retain access to an old executable.

This is because [CVE-2010-2059](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2059) specifically refers to RPM package upgrades, whereas [CVE-2005-4889](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-4889) specifically refers to RPM package removals (because SUSE had addressed the removal aspect previously, but not the upgrade aspect).   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c27)  Matt McCutchen    2010-06-12 02:27:45 UTC  ``` The failure to clear set[ug]id bits on package removal ([CVE-2005-4889](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-4889)) was addressed a long time ago in [bug 125517](show_bug.cgi?id=125517 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2005-4889 rpm: Updates leave hardlinked copies untouched.").

Mm... open() requires read (or write, duh) permission on the file, which no program with SUID/SGID bits enabled should have. Sure the link count test could be removed, it's there only to avoid unnecessary work in the common case. This just raises the question: how far should rpm go babysitting packagers/admins? Disallow creating packages with SUID/SGID on readable/writable files? If an admin changes permissions of an executable to something "vulnerable", is it rpm's job to try and mop it under the carpet?   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c29)  Matt McCutchen    2010-06-14 12:45:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c28)) > (In reply to [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c25)) > > I realized that hard links are not the only way to retain access to an old > > executable.

Clearing the set[ug]id bits is conditioned on the executable being set[ug]id in the first place, which is not the common case, so the unnecessary work there should be minimal.

Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0087: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Web Start, Java
Plug-in component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18,
5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0088: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0
Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0089: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Web Start, Java
Plug-in component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18,
5.0 Update 23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect availability
via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0091: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update
23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via
unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0095: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update
23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0839: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0840: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update
23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous
information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not
commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is related to
improper checks when executing privileged methods in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE), which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
via (1) an untrusted object that extends the trusted class but has not
modified a certain method, or (2) "a similar trust issue with interfaces,"
aka "Trusted Methods Chaining Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."
CVE-2010-0841: Unspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, and
1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow in the Java
Runtime Environment that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a JPEG image that contains subsample dimensions with large values,
related to JPEGImageReader and "stepX".
CVE-2010-0842: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is an uncontrolled array index that
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MIDI file with
a crafted MixerSequencer object, related to the GM\_Song structure.
CVE-2010-0843: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
claims from a reliable researcher that this is related to XNewPtr and
improper handling of an integer parameter when allocating heap memory
in the com.sun.media.sound libraries, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2010-0844: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is for improper parsing of a crafted
MIDI stream when creating a MixerSequencer object, which causes a pointer
to be corrupted and allows a NULL byte to be written to arbitrary memory.
CVE-2010-0846: Unspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25,
and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow
that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, related to an
"invalid assignment" and inconsistent length values in a JPEG image
encoder (JPEGImageEncoderImpl).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request -- rpm -- Fails to remove the SUID/SGID bits on package
 upgrade (RH BZ#598775)

Hi Steve, vendors,

    Matt McCutchen pointed out a deficiency in the way rpm handled rpm package upgrades --
it failed to clear out the SUID/SGID bits of the old file by file replacement when privileged
user performed package upgrade. Under certain circumstances, a local, authenticated user could
use this flaw to escalate their privileges.

Red Hat Bugzilla entry:
   [1] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=598775>

Upstream changeset:
   [2] <http://rpm.org/gitweb?p=rpm.git;a=commit;h=ca2d6b2b484f1501eafdde02e1688409340d2383>

Could you allocate CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c0)  Michael Schröder    2004-06-08 13:57:07 UTC  ``` If a malicious creates a hardlink to a buggy s-bit program the  system is still compromised even after a fixed version has been  installed. The attached fix removes the s-bits from files that  get updated.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c1)  Michael Schröder    2004-06-08 13:57:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 100965](attachment.cgi?id=100965&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=100965&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c2)  Matthew Miller    2005-04-26 16:37:56 UTC  ``` Fedora Core 2 is now maintained by the Fedora Legacy project for security updates only. If this problem is a security issue, please reopen and reassign to the Fedora Legacy product. If it is not a security issue and hasn't been resolved in the current FC3 updates or in the FC4 test release, reopen and change the version to match.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c3)  Michael Schröder    2005-04-26 16:48:43 UTC  ``` Hmm, good question. I leave it to your security group to decide if it's a  security issue or not. For now, I've changed the product to FC3.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c4)  Matthew Miller    2005-04-26 17:59:40 UTC  ``` Hmmm. I can see how that might be an issue. I'm going to clone this into Fedora Legacy as well as leaving in FC3. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c5)  Paul Nasrat    2005-04-26 22:13:47 UTC  ``` Adding security group and flag - will look at thanks.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c7)  Jeff Johnson    2005-11-04 13:38:47 UTC  ``` This patch should probably be done in other ways, but is ok for what the patch does.  Patch added to rpm cvs, should be in rpm-4.4.3-0.35 when built.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c8)  Michael Schröder    2010-06-02 13:00:58 UTC  ``` (Argh, you didn't apply the chunk that removes the bits in the FSM_RENAME case! See [bug #598775](show_bug.cgi?id=598775 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2059 rpm: fails to drop SUID/SGID bits on package upgrade"))   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c9)  Jeff Johnson    2010-06-02 13:31:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 419033](attachment.cgi?id=419033 "cvs diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=419033&action=edit "cvs diff") cvs diff  Patch to FSM_RENAME case was applied on 15 Nov 2005 20:06:53 exactly as stated.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c10)  Michael Schröder    2010-06-02 14:22:33 UTC  ``` Hmm, must have been a different branch. I just see the commit by Paul done Apr 16 13:26:12 2007, which doesn't contain it. rpm-4.4.2.3 also doesn't contain the FSM_RENAME part. Anyway, what's done is done. I don't want to do any finger pointing.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c11)  Jeff Johnson    2010-06-02 14:29:25 UTC  ``` You chose to add the comment here with "you" attached.  And not a different branch, 4.4.2 (on which @rpm.org is based) != 4.4.3.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c12)  Michael Schröder    2010-06-04 09:49:17 UTC  ``` (Turns out that maybe I'm the one to blame. I seem to have dropped the chunk by accident when porting the patch from 4.1.1 to 4.4.2, and Paul took it from out version. Hard to tell after such a long time.)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c13)  Jeff Johnson    2010-06-04 12:54:07 UTC  ``` Yes its been a long time and removing setuid/setgid (and capabilities and acls and ...) is a tedious issue which (if deserving of a CVE firedrill) also means that this rpmbuild issue also needs a CVE (imho its a far more serious issue):      Name: tag with malicious syntax in spec files can be used to remove home directories:               Name: foo;~      can trick rpmbuild into removing home directories and worse.  Then there's %verifyscript that is run multiple times, and the flaw saving/restoring the chroot directory using embedded lua (also from you and incorrect).  So it goes ... *shrug* ... Have fun!   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=125517#c14)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-14 19:52:56 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned the name [CVE-2005-4889](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-4889) to this issue.  Applying the alias here as per [bug #598775 comment #27](show_bug.cgi?id=598775#c27 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2059 rpm: fails to drop SUID/SGID bits on package upgrade").   ``` |  |
