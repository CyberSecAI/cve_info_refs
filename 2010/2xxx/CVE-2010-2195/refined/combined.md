### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

Hi,
the following CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) ids were
published for bozohttpd.

From the original reporter:
| "Bozohttpd is started from inetd with a configuration line
| in /etc/inetd.conf like this:
| www      stream tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/bozohttpd /var/www -X -H -S foobar -c /usr/lib/cgi-bin -U www-data -u
|
| There is a ~user1/public_html and there are other users on the system
| but without a public_html
|
| 1) Go to "<http://localhost/~user1/>"
|     I get the index.html from user1/public_html as expected
| 2) Go to "<http://localhost/~user2/>" (who don't have a public_html dir)
|    I get a
| "403 Forbidden /~user2/: Access to this item has been denied", as expected
|
| 3) Go to "<http://localhost/~user2/>" again (reload the page)
|   I don't get the error above, but just the directory index of ~user2
| (/home/user2).
|
| If I reload the page I get the result of 2) and 3) swapping around. 3)
| Shouldn't happen, as there is no public_html there. And anyone can:
| a) Probe for user names in the system (dir is there or not)
| b) Look at least the name of the files of some user.

The latest upstream version fixes both problems

If you fix the vulnerabilities please also make sure to include the
CVE ids in your changelog entry.

Version: 20090522-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Hi,
the following CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) ids were
published for bozohttpd.

From the original reporter:
| "Bozohttpd is started from inetd with a configuration line
| in /etc/inetd.conf like this:
| www      stream tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/bozohttpd /var/www -X -H -S foobar -c /usr/lib/cgi-bin -U www-data -u
|
| There is a ~user1/public_html and there are other users on the system
| but without a public_html
|
| 1) Go to "<http://localhost/~user1/>"
|     I get the index.html from user1/public_html as expected
| 2) Go to "<http://localhost/~user2/>" (who don't have a public_html dir)
|    I get a
| "403 Forbidden /~user2/: Access to this item has been denied", as expected
|
| 3) Go to "<http://localhost/~user2/>" again (reload the page)
|   I don't get the error above, but just the directory index of ~user2
| (/home/user2).
|
| If I reload the page I get the result of 2) and 3) swapping around. 3)
| Shouldn't happen, as there is no public_html there. And anyone can:
| a) Probe for user names in the system (dir is there or not)
| b) Look at least the name of the files of some user.

The latest upstream version fixes both problems

If you fix the vulnerabilities please also make sure to include the
CVE ids in your changelog entry.
