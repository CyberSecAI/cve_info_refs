- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the way that IIS parses specially crafted URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication to access restricted resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass directory-based basic authentication and access/execute resources that should require authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a specially crafted URL to bypass directory-based basic authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target IIS server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The web service should be using basic authentication.
