# 3.2.7, 3.4.7, 3.6.1, and 3.7.2 Security Advisory

Thursday, Aug 5th, 2010
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* It was possible to (at least partially) determine the membership
  of any group using the Search interface.

* It was possible to use the 'sudo' feature without sending
  a notification to the user being impersonated.

* The 'Reports' and 'Duplicates' pages let you guess the name of
  products you could not see, due to the error message that was
  thrown.

* For installations using PostgreSQL, specifying "bug X" or
  "attachment X" in a comment would deny access to the bug if X was
  larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer size.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Remote Information Disclosure
Affected:    2.19.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: An unprivileged user is normally not allowed to view
             other users' group membership. But boolean charts
             let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly
             disclosing group membership. This security fix
             restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user
             belongs to.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=417048
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2756

Class:       Notification Bypass
Affected:    2.22rc1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: Normally, when a user is impersonated, he receives
             an email informing him that he is being impersonated,
             containing the identity of the impersonator. However,
             it was possible to impersonate a user without this
             notification being sent.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=450013
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2757

Class:       Remote Information Disclosure
Affected:    2.17.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: An error message thrown by the "Reports" and "Duplicates"
             page confirmed the non-existence of products, thus
             allowing users to guess confidential product names.
             (Note that the "Duplicates" page was not vulnerable
             in Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and above though.)
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=577139
             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519835
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2758

Class:       Denial of Service
Affected:    2.23.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1, 3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: If a comment contained the phrases "bug X" or
             "attachment X", where X was an integer larger than the
             maximum 32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would
             throw an error, and any page containing that comment would
             not be viewable. On most Bugzillas, any user can enter
             a comment on any bug, so any user could have used this to
             deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas running on
             databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2759

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=623423#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-11 18:44:09 UTC  ``` Upstream Bugzilla has released 3.4.8 and 3.6.2 to address four security flaws [1]:  Vulnerability Details =====================  Class:       Remote Information Disclosure Versions:    2.19.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,              3.7 to 3.7.2 Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3 Description: An unprivileged user is normally not allowed to view              other users' group membership. But boolean charts              let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly              disclosing group membership. This security fix              restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user              belongs to. References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=417048> CVE Number:  [CVE-2010-2756](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2756)  Class:       Notification Bypass Versions:    2.22rc1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,              3.7 to 3.7.2 Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3 Description: Normally, when a user is impersonated, he receives              an email informing him that he is being impersonated,              containing the identity of the impersonator. However,              it was possible to impersonate a user without this              notification being sent. References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=450013> CVE Number:  [CVE-2010-2757](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2757)  Class:       Remote Information Disclosure Versions:    2.17.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,              3.7 to 3.7.2 Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3 Description: An error message thrown by the "Reports" and "Duplicates"              page confirmed the non-existence of products, thus              allowing users to guess confidential product names.              (Note that the "Duplicates" page was not vulnerable              in Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and above though.) References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=577139>              <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519835> CVE Number:  [CVE-2010-2758](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2758)  Class:       Denial of Service Versions:    2.23.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,              3.7 to 3.7.2 Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3 Description: If a comment contained the phrases "bug X" or              "attachment X", where X was an integer larger than the              maximum 32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would              throw an error, and any page containing that comment would              not be viewable. On most Bugzillas, any user can enter              a comment on any bug, so any user could have used this to              deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas running on              databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected. References:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=583690> CVE Number:  [CVE-2010-2759](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2759)  [1] <http://www.bugzilla.org/security/3.2.7/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=623423#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-11 18:46:15 UTC  ``` Created bugzilla tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 623426](show_bug.cgi?id=623426 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2756 CVE-2010-2757 CVE-2010-2758 CVE-2010-2759 bugzilla: multiple vulnerabilities corrected in 3.4.8/3.6.2 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=623423#c2)  Emmanuel Seyman    2010-08-28 08:16:54 UTC  ``` Errata has been released.   ``` |  |

check\_product() in Product.pm existed before Object.pm. We should now replace it by Object->check().

patch, v1.1
Hmm. For the cases like editflagtypes.cgi, I'd rather have an argument to check() that bypasses the Product->check() and goes straight to Object->check.
So, perhaps something like Bugzilla::Product->check({ name => $name, allow\_inaccessible => 1 });

patch, v2
This is fine, except that in the allow\_inaccessible case, you don't want to throw the product\_access\_denied error, so you probably should "if" or "unless" that.

Bugzilla::Product::check\_product() throws an error if you pass a product name which doesn't exist, letting the user know whether it's a valid product name or not.
This is going to be fixed in Bugzilla 4.2 as part of [bug 519835](/show_bug.cgi?id=519835 "RESOLVED FIXED - Bugzilla::Product::check_product() should be Bugzilla::Product->check()").

patch for 3.2 and 3.4, v1
This looks right.
For newer branches you should just be able to use check().

For 3.6, I think so. But 3.4 has no custom check() method (which is needed to override the error message).

I finally checked in [bug 519835](/show_bug.cgi?id=519835 "RESOLVED FIXED - Bugzilla::Product::check_product() should be Bugzilla::Product->check()") in 4.0, so Bugzilla 3.7.3 doesn't need to be fixed in this bug. duplicates.cgi was already fixed since Bugzilla 3.6rc1 thanks to [bug 514970](/show_bug.cgi?id=514970 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clean up duplicates.cgi and make it use Bug objects").

Bugzilla 3.6 has a custom check() method in Product.pm, which throws the appropriate error. So we can use it here.

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# BMO

From MozillaWiki
(Redirected from [BMO/](/index.php?title=BMO/&redirect=no "BMO/"))

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

This is the main public page for all things related to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org>, aka BMO, Mozilla's customized version of [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org).

BMO is a core piece of infrastructure at Mozilla. It is used to track not only bugs and feature requests but also many other tasks across various teams.

The BMO source is a slightly modified fork of Bugzilla with many custom extensions. It is currently based on Bugzilla 4.2 but with many features backported from 4.4 and master. All the BMO devs are also involved in the Bugzilla project, and we contribute features and fixes upstream where they are generally applicable, that is, not too specific to Mozilla's particular needs.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

# New Users

Getting used to Bugzilla can be a bit daunting. We have a short [introductory video](https://gerv.makes.org/popcorn/1bn6) available that is as gentle as possible. You may also be interested in the [[MDN section about Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Bugzilla)], which contains information more suitable as an introduction to a general audience. Of special interest is the MDN article, [What to do and what not to do in Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/What_to_do_and_what_not_to_do_in_Bugzilla), which contains instructions on getting elevated privileges.

# New Bots

If you have a bot that uses BMO, be sure to add it to the [BMO/Bot Registry](/BMO/Bot_Registry "BMO/Bot Registry")
so we know who to contact about it!

# User Guide

We're putting together a [user guide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide") with helpful information on various aspects of Bugzilla. New and experienced users alike should benefit from it. There's a lot to go through, so please feel free to contribute!

# Road Map

We keep a yearly [road map](/BMO/Road_Map "BMO/Road Map") with our medium-term plans (1-2 years), at a high level. Also see our [current projects](/BMO#Current_Projects "BMO") for some of the big items we are working on in the current quarter.

# Browser Support For BMO

Full Support includes: The current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, and Edge; and the latest Firefox ESR.

Limited Support includes: The previous versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, Edge, and Firefox ESR; and Firefox Nightly.

Internet Explorer is no longer supported, though some features may still work with IE 11.

See [bug 1359310](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1359310) and [bug 1422435](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422435).

## JavaScript and Analytics

JavaScript is required to use bugzilla.mozilla.org.

The `Do Not Track` header sent by your browser is honored.

# Third-Party Applications

Lots and lots of web apps and general tools have been written to interface with BMO. We have started [cataloguing them](/BMO/ThirdPartyApps "BMO/ThirdPartyApps"). If you're looking for different ways to interface with BMO, check it out; similarly, if you are thinking about writing an app, check the catalogue to see if something similar exists that you could use, contribute to, or fork before setting out on your own.

There's one in particular that is particularly important: [Phabricator](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html), Mozilla's new and growing code-review tool.

# More Information about BMO

Our discussion forum is mozilla.tools.bmo [[mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/tools-bmo)] [[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.tools.bmo)] [USENET].

We also have answers to [Frequently Asked Questions](/BMO/FAQ "BMO/FAQ") and a slightly-but-not-too-out-of-date [hardware diagram](http://people.mozilla.org/~justdave/BugzillaPhysicalDiagram-rev110504.png).

If you're building an application or tool that interfaces with BMO, you may be interested in the following:

* [Best practices and etiquette](/BMO/Integration_Best_Practice "BMO/Integration Best Practice") for integrating external apps with BMO
* Info and plans on Bugzilla's [REST API](/Bugzilla%3AREST_API "Bugzilla:REST API"), and the older, deprecated [BzAPI](/Bugzilla%3ABzAPI "Bugzilla:BzAPI").

# Contributing to BMO

If you'd like to help out with BMO specifically (as opposed to the general upstream [Bugzilla project](/Bugzilla "Bugzilla")), you can find us in #bmo on irc.mozilla.org. If you plan on contributing patches, see the documentation in the [README.rst](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/blob/master/README.rst). You can file bugs under the [bugzilla.mozilla.org product](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org). Don't file them under the Bugzilla product unless you are sure it's a bug in the general Bugzilla product. In particular, all administrative changes should be filed under bugzilla.mozilla.org (see below for more).

# Policies and Procedures

## Code Updates

Code updates are normally deployed to bugzilla.mozilla.org late Monday/early Tuesday, US/Pacific time, at no specific time, if changes need to be pushed out. Security fixes or other fatal type errors will always go out as soon as possible.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [BMO/Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

## Administrative Changes

If you need changes to BMO's configuration to support your team, project, etc., please consult this page before filing bugs:

* [General information on requesting Changes to BMO](/BMO/Requesting_Changes "BMO/Requesting Changes")

## BMO Administrative Processes

* [Adding a new product](/BMO/new-product "BMO/new-product")
* [Adding a new "rapid release" version](/BMO/new-version "BMO/new-version")
* [Adding a new BMO security group](/BMO/new-security-group "BMO/new-security-group")
* [Retiring Products and Components](/BMO/RetiringComponents "BMO/RetiringComponents"): moving things to the Graveyard classification.
* [Restoring Disabled Accounts](/BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts "BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts")
* [Merging Accounts](/index.php?title=BMO/MergingAccounts&action=edit&redlink=1 "BMO/MergingAccounts (page does not exist)")
* [Disabling Accounts](/BMO/DisablingAccounts "BMO/DisablingAccounts")

See also [BMO on Mana](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45845955) (requires LDAP).

## BMO Development and Other Processes

* [Overall Development Processes](/BMO/Development_Processes "BMO/Development Processes")

* [Planning a BMO outage](/BMO/OutagePlanning "BMO/OutagePlanning")
* [Reset the development branch to master](/BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch "BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch")
* [Maintaining Perl Dependencies for BMO](/BMO/Perl_Dependencies "BMO/Perl Dependencies")

## Custom Bug Entry Forms

In the past, BMO developers supported writing custom bug entry forms specific for the needs of different projects and groups within Mozilla. In order to focus more on other important features, we will no longer be providing that support going forward. For more information on why this change was made, see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.tools.bmo/tp4dSwUfKSA).

There is a new [custom form framework](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/custom-form-example) being developed by an outside contributor named Sebastin Santy. It is still in the early stages but it eventually will be very useful for users who want to create a customized bug entry form that can be used to submit bugs to BMO.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
