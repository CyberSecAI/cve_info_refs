This seems to crash at least EL3 and EL4 64bit versions, though crashes don't seem related.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c12)  Tom Lane    2010-06-15 13:22:35 UTC  ``` What I've been testing is builds of the older libtiff versions on my F-11 workstation, so there might be some small discrepancies from what you see on "real" EL3/4.  I did not see crashes from this particular test case on the older branches, but that doesn't mean they couldn't happen given other circumstances.  A large fraction of the other open libtiff bugs *do* crash the older builds for me.  My feeling is that the most prudent thing to do is apply as many of the 3.9.2 fixes to the older branches as can be made to fit.  In this particular case I found that the #2207 patch doesn't seem to be needed in EL4 but the #2208 one does.  Didn't look at the EL3 code yet.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-16 09:35:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c12)) > What I've been testing is builds of the older libtiff versions on my F-11 > workstation, so there might be some small discrepancies from what you see on > "real" EL3/4.  I did not see crashes from this particular test case on the > older branches, but that doesn't mean they couldn't happen given other > circumstances.  I did try EL4 libtiff built on F-12 x86_64 and it does not crash on this file, while real EL4 x86_64 dies on divide by zero.  It happens in TIFFVStripSize due to what seems to be a different compiler optimization wrt ycbcrsubsampling[2] array.  On real EL4, values are only stored in registers, while F-12 build uses memory.  TIFFGetField is called, but it does not change ycbcrsubsampling as TIFFFieldSet returns 0.  Hence following code uses whatever ycbcrsubsampling was initialized with, possibly 0 that leads to SIGPIPE in TIFFroundup calls.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-16 12:10:05 UTC  ``` Even stranger on EL3 x86_64:  Starting program: /usr/bin/tiff2rgba [bz583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")-test2.tif /dev/null [bz583081](show_bug.cgi?id=583081 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Assorted libtiff failures on downsampled OJPEG input")-test2.tif: Warning, unknown field with tag 513 (0x201) ignored.

It seems libtiff-subsampling.patch from [bug #603703](show_bug.cgi?id=603703 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - libtiff: TIFFReadEncodedStrip crash") should address this issue.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c16)  Tom Lane    2010-06-16 17:48:25 UTC  ``` Huh, I can't duplicate a crash on this file using RHEL4-U7-RC2_http-AS-x86_64 on a beaker machine.  However, I do see assorted crashes on the test files of other open libtiff bugs.  Your description sounds like this particular problem might be associated with a read of uninitialized memory, so maybe the lack of reproducibility isn't so surprising.  With the 603703 patch and some other patches I've been working on for the other issues, I get no crashes on EL4.  The EL3 case looks really odd though ... what I would expect to get is "Sorry, requested compression method is not configured" followed by exit(1), but it looks like it's trying to plow ahead anyway ...   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c17)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:32 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c18)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c19)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:15:06 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c20)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-24 16:29:52 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

Changing version to '14'.  More information and reason for this action is here: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=583081#c24)  Fedora End Of Life    2012-08-16 22:36:17 UTC  ``` This message is a notice that Fedora 14 is now at end of life. Fedora  has stopped maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 14. It is  Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no  longer maintained.  At this time, all open bugs with a Fedora 'version' of '14' have been closed as WONTFIX.  (Please note: Our normal process is to give advanced warning of this  occurring, but we forgot to do that. A thousand apologies.)  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, feel free to reopen  this bug and simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we were unable to fix it before Fedora 14 reached end of life. If you  would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged to click on  "Clone This Bug" (top right of this page) and open it against that  version of Fedora.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.  The process we are following is described here:  <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ``` |  |
