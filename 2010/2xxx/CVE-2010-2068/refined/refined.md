    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2068",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in mod_proxy_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under specific timeout conditions, the server might send a response intended for a different user. This only affects Windows, Netware, and OS2 operating systems and configurations using proxy worker pools.",
      "root_cause": "Improper timeout handling in mod_proxy_http.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information disclosure due to incorrect response handling under timeout conditions."
      ],
      "impact": "The server might return a response meant for another user, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending requests that trigger the specific timeout conditions in mod_proxy_http."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the server. The attacker needs to target systems running on Windows, Netware, or OS2, and must be able to trigger timeout conditions. The vulnerability is also dependent on the use of proxy worker pools.",
      "additional_details": "The simplest workaround is to globally configure 'SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1'.  This vulnerability is specific to Windows, Netware, and OS2 operating systems."
