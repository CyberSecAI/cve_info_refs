{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A malformed SQL query in the Mumble server's handling of client data could cause a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Mumble server did not properly sanitize or handle specially crafted SQL queries.",
        "Specifically, long usernames used in a 'LIKE' statement caused a crash."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, authenticated user could cause a denial of service by sending a crafted SQL query, leading to the termination of the mumble server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker would need to connect to the server."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must be an authenticated user on the Mumble server."
    ],
      "details": "The vulnerability exists in the way the Mumble server processes SQL queries, specifically using the 'LIKE' statement. An attacker with a long username could send a crafted query which causes the server to crash when processing the 'LIKE' statement in conjunction with the long username via a Qt SQLite database bug. A fix was implemented by sanitizing the input to prevent the server from crashing due to excessively long usernames used in LIKE statements."
