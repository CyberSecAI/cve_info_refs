{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it on a webpage. Specifically, HTML entity encoding is not performed on user-submitted data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including stealing cookies, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious websites.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by submitting a request via the web client with a malicious JavaScript payload in the summary field.",
      "Specifically, the XSS payload <script>alert(0)</script> can be injected.",
       "Directory disclosure is possible by using crafted URLs containing %u0085 or %u00A0.",
       "Configuration and source code disclosure is possible by appending a backslash to the filename of restricted file types (e.g., web.config\)"

    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to submit requests through the web client interface. Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter(s) and basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML encoding is required."
