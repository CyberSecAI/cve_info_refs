Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-2558:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a race condition that can corrupt memory when Internet Explorer accesses an object. Specifically, the issue arises when the browser tries to access an object that may have been modified or corrupted due to the race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition during object access within Internet Explorer. This means multiple threads or processes might attempt to modify or access an object concurrently, leading to unpredictable and potentially exploitable states.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The race condition leads to memory corruption, which can be further leveraged by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This means the attacker can gain full control over the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains complete control of the system.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could then install malware, view, modify or delete data, and create new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage that exploits the race condition in Internet Explorer.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
*  **Embedded ActiveX Control:** Attackers may embed a malicious ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the victim to visit the malicious webpage, typically through a link in an email or instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet and does not need physical access to the target machine.
*   **Crafted Webpage/Content:** The attacker must create a malicious web page or other content (e.g., a malformed ActiveX control) specifically designed to trigger the race condition.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to use social engineering to entice the user to visit the malicious content.
