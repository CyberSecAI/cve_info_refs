    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2872",
      "source": "www.zerodayinitiative.com_45a16fd6_20250125_002732.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the code responsible for parsing Director files. Specifically, when parsing the pami RIFF chunk, the application trusts an offset value and seeks into the file data. If signed values are provided in the data at the given offset, the process can miscalculate a pointer, leading to memory corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of signed offset values leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
          "Trust of user controlled input"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Visiting a malicious web page.",
        "Opening a malicious file."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious Director file or webpage with crafted pami RIFF chunk.",
       "additional_information": "Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-20.html"
