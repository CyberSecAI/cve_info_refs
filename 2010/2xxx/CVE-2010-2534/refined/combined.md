## Description

[![@DorpsGek](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16524860?u=bc99de718bbd1eca702f44f4fba5c55a342458a8&v=4&size=48)](/DorpsGek)[DorpsGek](https://github.com/DorpsGek)opened [on Jun 27, 2010](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/3909#issue-312179854)

***dolly* opened the ticket and wrote:**

> This bug cannot be easily reproduced on real server, because this situation is quite rare. Sometimes it takes days to trigger this on my servers.
>
> When new client is joining server game server just hangs up in infinite loop with 100% cpu usage. 1.0.0 is the last stable version without this bug. This behavior is triggered in NetworkSyncCommandQueue() function when there are some commands on \_local\_command\_queue that should be copied to joining client command queue. When the command is copied pointer reference to next command is not cleared and client command queue has now wrong reference to commands in \_local\_command\_queue which causes infinite for-loop in NetworkSyncCommandQueue() function.
>
> Attached patch should fix the problem.

### CVE-2010-2534 (vulnerable 1.0.1 - fixed 1.0.3)

Short description: Denial of service (server) via infinite loop

[Official CVE-2010-2534 entry at cve.mitre.org.](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2534)

Related bug reports:

* [GitHub Issue #3909](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/3909)

Related commits:

* [ed35d62](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/commit/ed35d62)

Patches: (sometimes more fuzz is needed to apply them)

* [For version 1.0.1 up to including 1.0.2](/security/CVE-2010-2534/1.0.1%20-%201.0.2.patch)

When multiple commands are queued (at the server) for execution in the next
game tick and an client joins the server can get into an infinite loop.

With the default settings triggering this bug is difficult (if not
impossible), however the larger value of the “frame\_freq” setting is easier
it is to trigger the bug.

To trigger this bug in a server there must be enough activity on the server,
that is commands being sent to the server for execution. Furthermore the
joining client that triggers the bug must know the server password if there
is a server password and there must be place for the new client.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> This bug cannot be easily reproduced on real server, because this situation is quite rare. Sometimes it takes days to trigger this on my servers.
>
> When new client is joining server game server just hangs up in infinite loop with 100% cpu usage. 1.0.0 is the last stable version without this bug. This behavior is triggered in NetworkSyncCommandQueue() function when there are some commands on \_local\_command\_queue that should be copied to joining client command queue. When the command is copied pointer reference to next command is not cleared and client command queue has now wrong reference to commands in \_local\_command\_queue which causes infinite for-loop in NetworkSyncCommandQueue() function.
>
> Attached patch should fix the problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request for OpenTTD

Hi folks,

the OpenTTD developers have indentified a security vulnerability in the
OpenTTD program. Would you be so kind as to allocate a CVE id for this
issue?

The issue concerns a denial of service vulnerability, in the form of a
hard to trigger infinite loop. The issue is reported at
<http://bugs.openttd.org/task/3909>

The first vulnerable version is 1.0.1, the upcoming 1.0.3 release will
have the issue fixed.

Once a CVE id is allocated, the issue will be documented at
<http://security.openttd.org/en/CVE-2010-xxxx>

Thanks,

Matthijs
