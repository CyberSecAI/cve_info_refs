Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2484:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `strrchr()` function within PHP 5.2.x. Specifically, there's an "interruption vulnerability" that allows a malicious script author to interrupt the internal PHP function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Interruption vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to interrupt the execution of the internal `strrchr()` function. This implies the function doesn't handle interruptions gracefully.
-   **Information Leak:** Successfully interrupting the function can lead to an information leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information by interrupting `strrchr()`. The details of what information could be leaked are not given in the provided text, but it could be data being processed by the function or from adjacent memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious Script:** An attacker needs to create a malicious PHP script that exploits the interruption vulnerability in `strrchr()`.
-   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the execution of the malicious PHP script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to execute a PHP script on a vulnerable system. This could be achieved through a web server that processes PHP scripts, or any other way of running php code on the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in PHP 5.2.14 by fixing the interruption issue in `strrchr()`.
*   The issue was also addressed as part of a wider fix of similar interruption issues in `strchr()`, `strstr()`, `substr()`, `chunk_split()`, `strtok()`, `addcslashes()`, `str_repeat()`, and `trim()`.
*   Red Hat does not consider this type of vulnerability, which allows for safe\_mode/open\_basedir restriction bypass, as a security concern. However, the information leak aspect may still be a concern.
*   Apple addressed this vulnerability in Security Update 2010-005, stating "Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP 5.3.1", indicating that they treated the vulnerability as important.
*   The vulnerability is related to similar issues such as CVE-2010-1864, where similar interruption of PHP internal functions led to bypasses of security features.
