| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=619324#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-29 09:32:17 UTC  ``` An interruption vulnerability was discovered in strrchr() in PHP 5.2.x.  A malicious script author could interrupt internal PHP function, leading to information leak.  Upstream commit: <http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=300916>  References: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3109> <http://www.php.net/releases/5_2_14.php>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=619324#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-29 09:32:45 UTC  ``` More info on the impact of the interruption vulnerabilities - [bug #617578](show_bug.cgi?id=617578 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2010-1864 php: addcslashes interruption vulnerability (MOPS-2010-006)"), [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=619324#c3).  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 169857](show_bug.cgi?id=169857 "CLOSED WONTFIX - php open_basedir / safe mode bypass") ***   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=619324#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-29 09:33:58 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat does not consider interruption issues allowing safe_mode / open_basedir restriction bypass to be security sensitive.  For more details see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=169857#c1](show_bug.cgi?id=169857#c1 "CLOSED WONTFIX - php open_basedir / safe mode bypass") and <http://www.php.net/security-note.php>   ``` |  |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- samba
A buffer overflow in the sid\_parse() function of samba could
potentially be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2010-3069).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- libgdiplus0
Specially crafted tiff, jpeg and bmp images could cause integer overflows in
ligdiplus0 (CVE-2010-1526).
- libwebkit

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

#### Security Update 2010-005

* **ATS**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1808

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A stack buffer overlow exists in Apple Type Services' handling of embedded fonts. Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1800

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: CFNetwork permits anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue does not affect the Mail application. This issue is addressed by disabling anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6.3. Credit to Aaron Sigel of vtty.com, Jean-Luc Giraud of Citrix, Tomas Bjurman of Sirius IT, and Wan-Teh Chang of Google, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **ClamAV**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0098, CVE-2010-1311

  Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues by updating ClamAV to version 0.96.1. ClamAV is distributed only with Mac OS X Server systems. Further information is available via the ClamAV website at <http://www.clamav.net/>

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1801

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files. Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking. Credit to Rodrigo Rubira Branco from the Check Point Vulnerability Discovery Team (VDT) for reporting this issue.

* **libsecurity**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1802

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position who can obtain a domain name that differs only in the last characters from the name of a legitimate domain may impersonate hosts in that domain

  Description: An issue exists in the handling of certificate host names. For host names containing three or more components, the last characters are not properly compared. In the case of a name containing exactly three components, only the last character is not checked. For example, if an attacker in a privileged network position could obtain a certificate for www.example.con the attacker can impersonate www.example.com. This issue is addressed through improved handling of certificate host names. Credit to Peter Speck for reporting this issue.

* **PHP**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1205

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Loading a maliciously crafted PNG image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

# PHP 5.2.14 Release Announcement

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
availability of PHP 5.2.14. This release focuses on improving the
stability of the PHP 5.2.x branch with over 60 bug fixes, some of which
are security related.

This release marks the end of the active support for PHP
5.2. Following this release the PHP 5.2 series will receive no further
active bug maintenance. Security fixes for PHP 5.2 might be published on a
case by cases basis. All users of PHP 5.2 are encouraged to upgrade to
PHP 5.3.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.2.14:**

* Rewrote var\_export() to use smart\_str rather than output buffering, prevents data disclosure if a fatal error occurs.
* Fixed a possible interruption array leak in strrchr().(CVE-2010-2484)
* Fixed a possible interruption array leak in strchr(), strstr(), substr(), chunk\_split(), strtok(), addcslashes(), str\_repeat(), trim().
* Fixed a possible memory corruption in substr\_replace().
* Fixed SplObjectStorage unserialization problems (CVE-2010-2225).
* Fixed a possible stack exaustion inside fnmatch().
* Fixed a NULL pointer dereference when processing invalid XML-RPC requests (Fixes CVE-2010-0397, bug #51288).
* Fixed handling of session variable serialization on certain prefix characters.
* Fixed a possible arbitrary memory access inside sqlite extension. Reported by Mateusz Kocielski.

**Key enhancements in PHP 5.2.14 include:**

* Upgraded bundled PCRE to version 8.02.
* Updated timezone database to version 2010.5.
* Fixed bug #52238 (Crash when an Exception occured in iterator\_to\_array).
* Fixed bug #52237 (Crash when passing the reference of the property of a non-object).
* Fixed bug #52041 (Memory leak when writing on uninitialized variable returned from function).
* Fixed bug #51822 (Segfault with strange \_\_destruct() for static class variables).
* Fixed bug #51552 (debug\_backtrace() causes segmentation fault and/or memory issues).
* Fixed bug #49267 (Linking fails for iconv on MacOS: "Undefined symbols: \_libiconv").

To prepare for upgrading to PHP 5.3, now that PHP 5.2's support ended, a
migration guide available on [http://php.net/migration53](/migration53), details the changes between
PHP 5.2 and PHP 5.3.
