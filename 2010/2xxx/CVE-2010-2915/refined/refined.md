Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection flaw present in the `welcome.php` script of the AJ HYIP PRIME application. The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input passed through the `id` parameter in the URL.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `id` parameter before using it in SQL queries, leading to a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploitation would allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the application's database, which could include user credentials, financial data, or other sensitive information.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `welcome.php` script by manipulating the `id` parameter. The attacker can send crafted SQL queries within the `id` parameter to extract data.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication or elevated privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the `welcome.php` script of the AJ HYIP PRIME application. The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input sanitization of the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject SQL queries and extract sensitive data from the database.
