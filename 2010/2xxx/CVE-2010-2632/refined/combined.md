How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Oracle Critical Update CVE-2010-2632

Original Release Date: February 18, 2011

Last Revised: February 18, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-040

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

New Critical Patch Updates or Security Alerts
have been issued by Oracle. Specific updates or alerts pertaining to this advisory are described below. Additional information about this issue may be found on the [Oracle Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html) website. The Oracle Advisory covering content outlined in this Avaya Security Advisory may be found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2011-194091.html).
**CVE-2010-2632**
Vulnerability in the Solaris component of Oracle Sun Products Suite (subcomponent: FTP Server). Supported versions that are affected are 8, 9, 10 and 11 Express. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows successful unauthenticated network attacks via FTP. Successful attack of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized Operating System hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS).
Component: Solaris
Subcomponent: FTP Server

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-2632](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2632) to this issue.

## 2. Avaya System Products using a Solaris Operating System:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with a Solaris Operating System.
Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R15, R16/R16.1/R16.2 | Low | Install patch 144053-04. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-2632 | This is a Low as FTP is disabled by default. |

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#include <glob.h>
int glob(const char \*pattern, int flags,
int (\*errfunc)(const char \*epath, int eerrno), glob\_t \*pglob);
Description
This function expands a filename wildcard which is passed as pattern.
GLOB\_LIMIT Limit the amount of memory used by matches to ARG\_MAX.
This option should be set for programs that can be
coerced to a denial of service attack via patterns that
expand to a very large number of matches, such as a long
string of \*/../\*/..
- --- 1. Multiple Vendors libc/glob(3) resource exhaustion ---
As we can read in definition GLOB\_LIMIT:
- --
Limit the amount of memory used by matches to ARG\_MAX. This option should be set for programs that can be coerced to a denial of service attack via patterns that expand to a very large number of mat
ches, such as a long string of \*/../\*/..
- ---
but now is comming question "what will happen when we use \*/.. without matching any results (simple searching)?" GLOB\_LIMIT will be not overflowed. To realize it, we need only use pattern with many
\*/.. and many inodes in current directory. On the end of pattern, we need add some not existed filename (like /cxib\*).
If we don't have many files or directories in attacked direcotry, we need create some dir-structure.
Let's see again:
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/libexec/ftpd/ftpd.c?rev=1.61.2.5&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup
GLOB\_LIMIT
protect us before attacks like
\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*
because glob will find more patches as in GLOB\_LIMIT declared. Anyway, if we use path what do not exists (with \*/.. strings) like
\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*/../\*blablahaha
GLOB\_LIMIT will be never overflowed. Many combinations of paths, will execute this proces a long time. We can also try allocate (GLOB\_LIMIT-1)\*MAXPATHNAMELEN bytes per one process. ~200~300MB
Example:

this request will generate 100% usage of process a long time. ftpd come into glob(3) and will not fast out. Very similar sympthon was described in vulnerability for glibc strfmon(3)

...
Interesting is that the PHP memory\_limit has no control over what will
happens in the level of the libc. Function strfmon(3) can allocate a lot of
data in memory without control by PHP memory\_limit.
For example:
php -r 'money\_format("%.1343741821i",1);'
will allocate ~1049MB real memory.
memory\_limit can be less that 1049M
...
- - http://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2009090044 --
ftpd also dosen't control what will happen in libc.
so it is enough to send

and disconnect to connect again (bypass firewall limits). In php we can also bypass max\_memory\_limit by libc vulns.
Attacking machine in this way, we can call the various side effects.

As we can see, glob3() will call to (\*readdirfunc)() and back to glob2(). glob2() will come again in glob3()... we need try control, how many times glob will call to (\*readdirfunc)() and stat().

To sucessfully attack, we need calculate pattern. I am not going show, how to optimal calulate pattern.
With similar PoC we can try attack ftp.adobe.com, ftp.openbsd.org etc.

[ Multiple Vendors libc/glob(3) GLOB\_BRACE|GLOB\_LIMIT memory exhaustion ]
Author: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
http://netbsd.org/donations/
http://cxib.net/
Date:
- Dis.: 19.01.2011
- Pub.: 02.05.2011
CVE: CVE-2011-0418
Affected Software (verified):
- NetBSD 5.1
- and more
--- 0.Description ---
#include <glob.h>
int glob(const char \*pattern, int flags,
int (\*errfunc)(const char \*epath, int eerrno), glob\_t \*pglob);
Description
This function expands a filename wildcard which is passed as pattern.
GLOB\_LIMIT Limit the amount of memory used by matches to ARG\_MAX. This option should be set for programs that can be coerced to a denial of service attack via patterns that expand to a very large number of matches, such as a long string of \*/../\*/..
--- 1. Multiple Vendors libc/glob(3) GLOB\_BRACE|GLOB\_LIMIT memory exhaustion ---
Analyzing history of GLOB\_LIMIT, we should start since 2001, where it has been added to protect ftp servers before memory exhaustion.
http://www.mail-archive.com/bugtraq@securityfocus.com/msg04960.html
Any 'pattern', should be limited and controlled by GLOB LIMIT. Algorithm used in glob(3) is not optimal, and doesn't support functions like realpath() to eliminate duplicates. It's not easy to predict the greatest possible complexity. Anyway in 2010, netbsd has extended GLOB\_LIMIT for a few new limits like: stats, readdir and malloc
OpenBSD has localized some integer overflow. In glob(3) function, exists some malloc() allowing allocate n<INT\_MAX bytes into memory.
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/gen/glob.c.diff?r1=1.34;r2=1.35;f=h
-globextend()/openbsd--
749: newn = 2 + pglob->gl\_pathc + pglob->gl\_offs;
750: if (pglob->gl\_offs >= INT\_MAX ||
751: pglob->gl\_pathc >= INT\_MAX ||
752: newn >= INT\_MAX ||
753: SIZE\_MAX / sizeof(\*pathv) <= newn ||
754: SIZE\_MAX / sizeof(\*statv) <= newn) {
755: nospace:
756: for (i = pglob->gl\_offs; i < (ssize\_t)(newn - 2); i++) {
757: if (pglob->gl\_pathv && pglob->gl\_pathv[i])
758: free(pglob->gl\_pathv[i]);
759: if ((pglob->gl\_flags & GLOB\_KEEPSTAT) != 0 &&
760: pglob->gl\_pathv && pglob->gl\_pathv[i])
761: free(pglob->gl\_statv[i]);
762: }
763: if (pglob->gl\_pathv) {
764: free(pglob->gl\_pathv);
765: pglob->gl\_pathv = NULL;
766: }
767: if (pglob->gl\_statv) {
768: free(pglob->gl\_statv);
769: pglob->gl\_statv = NULL;
770: }
771: return(GLOB\_NOSPACE);
772: }
-globextend()/openbsd--
however SIZE\_MAX and INT\_MAX doesn't protect us before memory exhaustion. The real problem here is uncontrolled malloc(3) call. globextend() will be executed a lot of times and we should reduce calls to glob0() and globexp1(). Therefore has been created a new limit, limiting 'braces' used in 'pattern'.
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/gen/glob.c.diff?r1=text&tr1=1.27&r2=text&tr2=1.29
If we don't reduce this call
-globextend()/netbsd--
static int
globextend(const Char \*path, glob\_t \*pglob, size\_t \*limit)
{
char \*\*pathv;
size\_t i, newsize, len;
char \*copy;
const Char \*p;
\_DIAGASSERT(path != NULL);
\_DIAGASSERT(pglob != NULL);
newsize = sizeof(\*pathv) \* (2 + pglob->gl\_pathc + pglob->gl\_offs);
pathv = pglob->gl\_pathv ? realloc(pglob->gl\_pathv, newsize) :
malloc(newsize); <==== UNSECURE CALL
...
-globextend()/netbsd--
newsize = sizeof(\*pathv) \* (2 + pglob->gl\_pathc + pglob->gl\_offs);
malloc(3) try allocate (4\*pglob->gl\_pathc) bytes.

Many servers are still vulnerable to the above vulnerability and CVE-2010-4754, CVE-2010-4755, CVE-2010-4756, CVE-2010-2632. Servers like ftp.sun.com ftp.sony.com seems still be affected.
