  "CVE-2010-2253": {
    "Description": "The lwp-download script, which is part of the libwww-perl library, is vulnerable to a filename manipulation issue. When downloading files, lwp-download may use the filename suggested in the Content-Disposition header or the filename portion of the URL specified in the Location header during HTTP redirections. This can be exploited by a malicious server to force the client to save the file with a different name, potentially overwriting hidden or initialization files in the user's directory.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from implicitly trusting filenames suggested by the server in the Content-Disposition header or the Location header during HTTP redirections, without proper sanitization or validation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Unsafe handling of Content-Disposition header",
      "Unsafe handling of filenames from Location header during HTTP redirections",
      "Implicit trust of server-provided filenames"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious attacker can cause the client to save the downloaded file under an unexpected name, potentially overwriting critical files (e.g. .login, .bashrc) in the user's home directory. This can lead to arbitrary code execution upon the user's next login or shell invocation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious server provides a crafted Content-Disposition header with an unexpected file name",
      "A malicious server responds with a 3xx HTTP redirection containing a malicious filename in the Location header"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to control a server that the victim client connects to for downloading a file",
      "Ability to manipulate HTTP responses, including headers, from the server"
    ],
        "Additional Information": {
            "Affected Components": [
               "lwp-download script",
               "libwww-perl library"
            ],
            "Affected Versions": [
                "libwww-perl <= 5.834"
             ],
            "Fixed Versions": [
                "libwww-perl >= 5.835"
            ],
             "Specific Exploit Scenario Details": [
              "The lwp-download script uses the suggested filename from the Content-Disposition header by default.",
              "The lwp-download script automatically uses the filename portion of the URL in the Location header when following HTTP 3xx redirects."
           ],
            "Mitigation": [
              "Users should apply the security update for the libwww-perl package"
           ],
           "Notes": [
              "The vulnerability is in the lwp-download script, which is a sample application shipped with perl-libwww-perl. The libwww-perl library itself is not affected.",
                "A patch is available to correct this issue and require the -s option to honor the Content-Disposition header."
             ]
        }
