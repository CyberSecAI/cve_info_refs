Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the HauntmAx CMS application. Specifically, the `state` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into the `state` parameter of the `index.php` script. This is due to improper handling of user-supplied data, which allows the attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application.
- **Directory Listing:** The provided text also mentions a "Haunted House Directory Listing", which, while not directly related to the SQL injection vulnerability, could present additional information leakage if not properly secured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could lead to:
    - Disclosure of sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., user credentials, application data)
    - Modification or deletion of data in the database
    - Potential for complete control of the database server depending on database configuration and privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `index.php` script, by manipulating the `state` parameter in the URL.
  - Example URL: `http://[site]/index.php?c_action=listings&state=%272` (The `'2` is an example of injected SQL).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Web Security Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques and how to manipulate HTTP requests.
