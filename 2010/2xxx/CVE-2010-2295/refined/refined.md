{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability of a webpage to programmatically focus an iframe during key events, allowing the potential for keystroke injection or theft.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper focus handling during key events",
      "Lack of cross-origin restrictions on focus changes"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially inject keystrokes into a focused iframe from a different domain, enabling them to perform actions on behalf of the user or steal sensitive information like passwords. This can be achieved by manipulating focus during keypress events to direct user input to a malicious location without the user's awareness.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious webpage loads a legitimate site in an iframe.",
        "The malicious page manipulates focus using JavaScript's focus() method during a keypress event to direct input to the iframe.",
        "Alternatively, an iframe can attempt to focus the top window, which could lead to unexpected focus changes.",
        "HTML5 'autofocus' attribute to achieve keystroke stealing without any script, in combination with iframe"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control a website visited by the victim and load another site in an iframe."
