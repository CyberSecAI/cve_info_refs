New CAS documentation site

CAS documentation has moved over to [apereo.github.io/cas](http://apereo.github.io/cas), starting with CAS version 4.x. The wiki will no longer be maintained. For the most recent version of the documentation, please refer to the aforementioned link.

As of May 15th, we've reorganized the Jasig CAS Client section of the wiki to make it easier to find particular clients. We've organized the clients into various groups. Those groups are detailed below.  Click on the "+" symbols on the left to view the individual clients.

### Official Clients

Official Clients are generally being actively developed and maintained. On the CAS Users list, you're most likely able to find someone that's used the client and can assist you with deploying it.

* [.Net Cas Client](/wiki/spaces/CASC/pages/103252602/.Net%2BCas%2BClient)
* [CAS Client for Java 3.0](/wiki/spaces/CASC/pages/103252595/CAS%2BClient%2Bfor%2BJava%2B3.0)
* [CAS Client for Java 3.1](/wiki/spaces/CASC/pages/103252596/CAS%2BClient%2Bfor%2BJava%2B3.1)
* [mod\_auth\_cas](/wiki/spaces/CASC/pages/103252587/mod_auth_cas)
* [phpCAS](/wiki/spaces/CASC/pages/103252517/phpCAS)
* [Spring Security (previously Acegi) as CAS Client](/wiki/spaces/CASC/pages/103252521/Spring%2BSecurity%2Bpreviously%2BAcegi%2Bas%2BCAS%2BClient)
* [shiro-cas module](/wiki/spaces/CASC/pages/103252518/shiro-cas%2Bmodule)

### Legacy Clients

Legacy Clients are the original Yale Clients, such as the Java, Apache module, PAM, and PL/SQL module. In many cases, they are no longer actively being developed, but still function quite well (i.e. the PAM module). In other cases, they've been superseded by newer clients (i.e. The Jasig CAS Client for Java and mod\_auth\_cas, the Apache module). You will still find many people on the CAS User Support lists who are familiar with these modules, but many have migrated to the newer code.

### Incubating Clients

Incubating Clients are new clients that are under development, and which may become official clients. They're up-and-coming clients that we're paying attention to, have petitioned the Steering Committee to become official clients, and often have active members on the CAS User Support List.

### Unofficial CAS Clients

This is essentially all of the clients people have let us know about, that may or may not be in active development anymore, and may solve a niche need. You should use these at your own risk. Many are excellent clients, but may no longer be supported any more. Others are purely theoretical examples of of how a client would function.

### CASifying Applications

This section describes some unofficial instructions, many contributed by users, on how to CASify particular applications.

### Attributes of Client Status

| Attribute | Incubating | Official | Legacy | Unofficial | Deprecated\* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active development   * Lead developer/point person * Will receive security updates | (tick) | (tick) | (error) | (question) |  |
| Stable, well tested | (error) | (tick) | (tick) | (question) |  |
| Active community (deployers, etc) | (error) | (tick) | (question) | (question) |  |
| Source hosted at Jasig | (tick) | (tick) | (tick) | (error) |  |
| Superceded |  |  |  |  | (tick) |

* Deprecated may apply to any of the four statuses.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-2795 CVE-2010-2796 CVE-2010-3690 CVE-2010-3691 CVE-2010-3692

Several vulnerabilties have been discovered in phpCAS, a CAS client
library for PHP. The Moodle course management system includes a copy
of phpCAS.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.13-3.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
