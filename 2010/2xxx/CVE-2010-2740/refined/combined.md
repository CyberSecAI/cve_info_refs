# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Willkommen bei der siberas GmbH

## **Research Driven Security Consulting**

Wir sind ein auf Sicherheitsanalysen und Penetrationstests spezialisiertes Beratungsunternehmen, welches Sie herstellerunabhÃ¤ngig und kompetent im Bereich IT-Sicherheit berÃ¤t. Unser Ziel ist es, Schwachstellen in Systemen und Applikationen zu identifizieren und entsprechende MaÃnahmen zu empfehlen, damit Sie Ihr Sicherheitsniveau nachhaltig verbessern kÃ¶nnen.

## Leistungen

### Penetrationstests / RedTeaming

Bei unseren Penetrationstests analysieren wir Applikationen und
Infrastrukturen aus der Sicht eines technisch versierten Angreifers.
Hierbei setzen wir, den individuellen Anforderungen entsprechend,
unterschiedliche Techniken ein, wie beispielsweise auch
Social Engineering oder Physical Hacking.

### Product Security

Unsere Leistungen im Bereich Product Security haben zum Ziel, eingesetzte
Produkte hinsichtlich ihres Sicherheitsniveaus zu analysieren. Hierbei
spielt es keine Rolle, ob es sich um Closed- oder Open Source Produkte
oder gar Hardware Appliances handelt. Wir analysieren diese Produkte im
Sinne unserer Kunden hinsichtlich ihrer Wirkung (z.B. Data Exfiltration
Prevention), versteckter Funktionen (Backdoors, Phone-Home) oder
unbekannter Schwachstellen. Aufgrund unserer Research TÃ¤tigkeiten sind
wir in der Lage, ein HÃ¶chstmaÃ an QuÃ¤litÃ¤t zu bieten.

### Mobile Security

Ob iOS oder Android, wir analysieren Ihre Apps hinsichtlich typischer Fehler, die bei der Entwicklung
hÃ¤ufig gemacht werden und dadurch die Sicherheit Ihrer Systeme und/oder Kundendaten gefÃ¤hrden kÃ¶nnen. Hierzu
zÃ¤hlen beispielsweise die unsichere Speicherung von Daten auf dem EndgerÃ¤t, die unsichere Ãbertragung von Daten
aufgrund schwacher VerschlÃ¼sselung oder auch Admin-Backdoors bzw. hart-codierte PasswÃ¶rter. SelbstverstÃ¤ndlich
gehÃ¶rt die ÃberprÃ¼fung des zugehÃ¶rigen Backends auch zu unserem Leistungsspektrum.

### Sicherheit im Zahlungsverkehr

Im Bereich des Zahlungsverkehrs haben wir uns in den letzten Jahren auf die ÃberprÃ¼fung von FinTS und EBICS Schnittstellen
spezialisiert. FÃ¼r diese beiden Protokolle haben wir eigene Testframeworks entwickelt, wodurch wir in der Lage sind,
hochwertige Sicherheitsanalysen durchzufÃ¼hren. Unsere Erfahrung hat gezeigt, dass diese Schnittstellen nur selten richtig
Ã¼berprÃ¼ft werden, da es keine verbreiteten Werkzeuge dafÃ¼r gibt und dadurch Schwachstellen unentdeckt bleiben.

## Research

Wir suchen laufend nach neuen Möglichkeiten und Herangehensweisen, um Schwachstellen möglichst effizient zu identifizieren und auszunutzen.

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Microsoft issued a security bulletin which contained security advisory MS10-078. This security update resolves vulnerabilities in the Windows OpenType Font (OTF) format driver. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user views content rendered in a specially crafted OpenType font. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2010-2740](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2740) and
[CVE-2010-2741](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2741) to these issues. A description of the vulnerabilities may be found at:

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-078.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products:

Avaya system products include an Operating System with the product when it is delivered. The system products described below are delivered with a Microsoft Operating System. Actions to be taken with these products are also described below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CallPilot | All | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |
| Communication Server 1000 Telephony Manager | All | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-078 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in the OpenType Font (OTF) Format Driver Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2279986)

Published: October 12, 2010

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in the Windows OpenType Font (OTF) format driver. This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. All supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not affected by the vulnerability. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user views content rendered in a specially crafted OpenType font. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way the OpenType Font (OTF) format driver allocates memory and performs integer calculations when processing OpenType fonts. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

#### FAQ for OpenType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2740

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the OpenType Font (OTF) format driver does not properly allocate memory when parsing a specially crafted font.

**What is the OpenType Font format?**

OpenType is a font format developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe as an extension of Apple's TrueType font format. An OpenType font file contains data, in table format, that comprises either a TrueType or a PostScript outline font. Rasterizers use combinations of data from the tables contained in the font to render the TrueType or PostScript glyph outlines. Some of this supporting data is used no matter which outline format is used; some of the supporting data is specific to either TrueType or PostScript. For more information, see the [Microsoft Typography OpenType FAQ](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/opentypefaq.mspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over an affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Are third-party Web browsers affected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. Third-party Web browsers are affected by this vulnerability if they natively render OpenType Fonts (OTF). For these applications, this vulnerability may allow remote code execution in the context of the logged on user if used to view a Web site with an embedded, specially crafted font. By default, Internet Explorer is not affected by this issue.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the OpenType Font (OTF) format driver allocates memory when parsing a font.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
