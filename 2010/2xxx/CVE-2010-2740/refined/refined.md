Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-2740:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the Windows OpenType Font (OTF) format driver improperly parsing specially crafted OpenType fonts, specifically due to improper memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper memory allocation when parsing a specially crafted OpenType font.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to:
    - Installation of programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creation of new accounts with full user rights
    - Complete control over the affected system

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application or view content containing a specially crafted OpenType font.
- Third-party web browsers that render OpenType fonts natively are also vulnerable and could allow for remote code execution in the context of the logged on user if used to view a website with a malicious embedded font.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Valid logon credentials
- Ability to log on locally to the affected system
- Ability to execute a specially crafted application or display crafted content.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in how the OpenType Font (OTF) format driver allocates memory when parsing a specially crafted font.
- The vulnerability is described as an elevation of privilege vulnerability.
- The affected software includes Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2, and Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by locally logged on users, it is not exploitable remotely or by anonymous users.
- Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- There were no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild when the security bulletin was originally issued.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the OpenType Font (OTF) format driver allocates memory when parsing a font.
- Third party web browsers that render OpenType Fonts (OTF) are affected and may allow for remote code execution.
