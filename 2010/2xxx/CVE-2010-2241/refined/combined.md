Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0590)

## Topic

Updated Red Hat Directory Server and related packages that fix one security
issue, multiple bugs, and add enhancements are now available as Red Hat
Directory Server 8.2.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3-compliant directory server. The
redhat-ds-base package includes the LDAP server and command line utilities
for server administration.

Directory Server setup scripts created cache files, containing passwords
for the Directory and Administration Server administrative accounts, with
weak file permissions. A local user could use this flaw to obtain
authentication credentials for the administrative accounts. (CVE-2010-2241)

This update also adds the following enhancements:

* Entry USN - The Entry USN Plug-in provides a way for LDAP clients to know

that something in the database has changed by generating a global update
sequence number (USN) for every write operation.

* Linked Attributes - The new Linked Attributes Plug-in uses the DN value

of a known attribute to trace its way to the referenced entry, and then it
adds a reciprocal value, pointing back to the first entry.

* Bitwise Search - This release adds support for bit field values in LDAP

searches.

* Dereference Control - This release adds server support for the

dereference control in LDAP searches. A dereferencing search tracks back
over cross-references in an entry and returns information about the
referenced entry.

* PAM Pass-through Plug-in - The PAM PTA plug-in allows Directory Server to

leverage a network's existing PAM service to authenticate users.

* SMD5 Password Storage Scheme - Passwords can now be stored with the

salted MD5 password hash.

* Syntax Checking - A new syntax validation plug-in verifies that the value

given for an attribute in an operation matches the required syntax for that
attribute.

* Anonymous Resource Limits - A new server configuration attribute enables

the Directory Server to apply resource limits to anonymous binds.

* Anonymous Access Switch - A new server configuration attribute tells the

Directory Server to disable anonymous binds for added security.

* Secure Binds Switch - A new server configuration attribute tells the

Directory Server to require a secure connection of some kind for any simple
binds.

* SSF Restrictions - A new server configuration attribute allows

administrators to set a minimum Security Strength Factor (SSF) for all
connections to the server, which can require a secure connection.

* Mixed SASL/TLS Connections - Now, the server can have both SASL and TLS

configured.

* Setting Plug-in Load Orders - A new plug-in configuration attribute sets

the load order preference for the plug-in, anywhere from 1 to 99. This
effectively sets the load order for plug-ins of the same type.

* Named Pipe Log Script - A new directory script allows logging data to be

sent to a named pipe instead of the standard server logs.

* Simple Paged Results - This release adds server support for results of

LDAP searches to be broken into pages.

* New Matching Rule and Attribute Syntaxes - This release adds support for

several new matching rules and 11 new attribute syntaxes.

These packages also contain many bug fixes for major features in Red Hat
Directory Server, including replication, synchronization, setup and
migration, command line tools, the Java console, and the Administration
Server. Refer to the Red Hat Directory Server 8.2 Release Notes for further
information:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/8.2/rel-notes/html>

All Red Hat Directory Server users should upgrade to Red Hat Directory
Server 8.2, which resolves these issues and adds these enhancements.

## Solution

Users running Red Hat Directory Server should consult the Red Hat Directory
Server 8.2 Release Notes for installation and upgrade instructions:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/8.2/rel-notes/html>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=608032#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-25 13:27:39 UTC  ``` setup-ds.pl and setup-ds-admin.pl scripts used to configure Red Hat / 389 Directory Server instances and administration server instances creates a cache file containing configuration parameters provided by administrator configuring directory server.  The file is created in /tmp with random name as setupXXXXXX.inf.  It contains information such as directory server instance name, user and group under with ns-slapd should run, network port directory and administration server should listen on, base DN and administrative user names and accounts.  This file is created with permissions depending on current umask setting, which is 022 for root account by default, which results in file being created as world readable.  Any local user can take advantage of the weak file permissions and obtain administrative account passwords, which give them full control over directory server instance.  This file is removed at the end of the setup run which limits exposure, but it is not removed when setup is started with -k or --keepcache.  For additional details and patch changing setup scripts to always create cache file with restricted permissions, see:   [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=593392](show_bug.cgi?id=593392)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=608032#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-03 20:13:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Directory Server 8 for RHEL 4   Red Hat Directory Server 8 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2010:0590 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0590.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=608032#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-25 13:27:39 UTC  ``` setup-ds.pl and setup-ds-admin.pl scripts used to configure Red Hat / 389 Directory Server instances and administration server instances creates a cache file containing configuration parameters provided by administrator configuring directory server.  The file is created in /tmp with random name as setupXXXXXX.inf.  It contains information such as directory server instance name, user and group under with ns-slapd should run, network port directory and administration server should listen on, base DN and administrative user names and accounts.  This file is created with permissions depending on current umask setting, which is 022 for root account by default, which results in file being created as world readable.  Any local user can take advantage of the weak file permissions and obtain administrative account passwords, which give them full control over directory server instance.  This file is removed at the end of the setup run which limits exposure, but it is not removed when setup is started with -k or --keepcache.  For additional details and patch changing setup scripts to always create cache file with restricted permissions, see:   [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=593392](show_bug.cgi?id=593392)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=608032#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-03 20:13:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Directory Server 8 for RHEL 4   Red Hat Directory Server 8 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2010:0590 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0590.html>   ``` |  |
