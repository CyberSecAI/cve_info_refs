| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=568621#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-02-26 06:56:28 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Alan pointed out a race in the code where hvc_remove is invoked. The recent virtio_console work is the first user of hvc_remove().  Alan describes it thus:  The hvc_console assumes that a close and remove call can't occur at the same time.  In addition tty_hangup(tty) is problematic as tty_hangup is asynchronous itself....  So this can happen          hvc_close                               hvc_remove         hung up ? - no                                                 lock                                                 tty = hp->tty                                                 unlock         lock         hp->tty = NULL         unlock         notify del         kref_put the hvc struct         close completes         tty is destroyed                                                 tty_hangup dead tty                                                 tty->ops will be NULL                                                 NULL->...  This patch adds some tty krefs and also converts to using tty_vhangup().  Reported-by: Alan Cox <alan.org.uk> Signed-off-by: Amit Shah <amit.shah> CC: Alan Cox <alan.org.uk> CC: linuxppc-dev CC: Rusty Russell <rusty.au> ---  Alan, how does this version look?  I've tested with multiple virtio_console ports.  There's some other bug in the hvc_remove code that's unrelated: hot-removal of one console port results in all other hvc consoles to stop working. I'll look at that once this is finalised.   drivers/char/hvc_console.c |   31 +++++++++++++++++++++----------  1 files changed, 21 insertions(+), 10 deletions(-)  <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/83353/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=568621#c7)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-04 08:58:36 UTC  ``` <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/83353/> <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/3/3/207>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=568621#c8)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-04 09:06:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.

Use CVE-2010-2653

Let's ignore the default case.  If there's a feature that's available to
some set of users, no matter how small, then CVE assignment is reasonable,
even if it's not the default.  It's not much different than if you have an
issue that only affects a particular chip set or compiler.

Heads-up. You might want to backport this if your kernel is affected. We
are not requesting a CVE name for this as it does not affect any of our
Red Hat supported kernels.

Actually, upon review, I see that it is enabled (see the powerpc64
image). Therefore, I'd like to request a CVE ID for it.

are you sure about this?  i see the vulnerable code upstream in both
2.6.26 and 2.6.32.  does redhat not ship hvc in their kernels?  i think
this should get a cve id because the more vanilla distros will have
shipped with this included.

i see that hvc_console is disabled by default in the debian kernels,
and i assume it is the same for the redhat kernels.

are issues in features that are disabled by default generally treated
as unimportant? there are bound to be a (perhaps small) subset of users
turning these features on; exposing themselves to more risk if these
issues go unfixed. i suppose cve assignment depends on whether or not
there is an expectation to protect those users in addition to
defaults-using users.

Thanks for making sure.

At least not for the officially supported kernels as shipped in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux. I don't speak for other vendors, so if they need a CVE
name, they should request for one.

Thanks, Eugene

They are not treated as unimportant. However, customers have been
advised that our support scope of coverage does not include modified
RPMs (i.e. recompiling of kernels to enable unsupported features, etc).

Feel free to email us directly at secalert@...hat.com if you have more
vendor/Red Hat-specific questions.

Thanks, Eugene
