    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of .dir and .dcr files, specifically an undocumented record of type 0xFFFFFFF8. During parsing, the process uses two user-supplied word values to perform arithmetic calculations for determining heap buffer size. This arithmetic can result in an integer wrap due to overly large values.",

        "Visiting a malicious webpage",
