  "CVE-2010-2023": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Exim Incorrect Handling of Writable Sticky-Bit Mail Directories Vulnerability",
    "details": "The vulnerability exists in how Exim handles writable mail directories with the sticky bit set. A local user could create hard links to other non-root users' files in the mail directory. When mail is delivered to the linked file, it would be appended to the linked file, potentially leading to denial of service or privilege escalation. Specifically, when Exim is configured with a world-writable mail directory with the sticky bit set, a local user can create a hard link to another non-root user's file at the expected location of that user's mailbox. Subsequent mail delivery would then write to the linked file, allowing for potential privilege escalation to the targeted user.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Exim mail transfer agent",
      "appendfile.c"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause is Exim's failure to verify the link count of a file in a world-writable directory with the sticky bit set. This allows for the creation of hard links to other user's files, which would then be appended upon mail delivery.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure handling of hard links",
      "Incorrect file permissions check"
    ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by overwriting other users' files or potentially escalate privileges.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system with the ability to create files in the mail directory.",
    "patches": [
      "The issue was fixed by checking the link count of the file before writing to prevent hard link attacks in sticky-bit mail directories.",
        "A patch was provided to correct the behavior."
