## S2 NetBox allows unauthenticated HTTP access to node logs, backups, and employee photographs

#### Vulnerability Note VU#251133

Original Release Date: 2010-06-24 | Last Revised: 2010-07-09

---

### Overview

S2 NetBox and related products do not adequately restrict access to node logs, backups, and employee photographs. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use information obtained from a vulnerable system to aid in further attacks.

### Description

| [S2](http://www.s2sys.com/) NetBox is a line of "...open architecture, scalable, IP network-ready products for the physical security industry that integrate access control, alarm monitoring, video surveillance, and temperature monitoring." S2 Netbox systems are operated entirely via a web interface.  The Netbox web server does not properly authenticate access to several directories, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to access network node logs, employee photographs, and backup archives.Linear (formerly IEI) eMerge is based on S2 Netbox, and Sonitrol eAccess is based on Linear eMerge. eMerge and eAccess may also be affected by this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker can access node logs, backups, and employee photographs. An attacker may be able to crack passwords contained in a backup and gain administrative control over the system. Node logs and employee photographs could provide an attacker with reconnaissance information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or patch**S2 Security has made patches or upgrades available to address this vulnerability for Netbox versions 2.5, 3.3, and 4.0. Please contact S2 or Linear customer support. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restrict network access to S2 Netbox systems to trusted and authorized hosts and networks. Separate management networks from general purpose user networks. Do not allow access from untrusted networks such as the internet. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## S2 NetBox allows unauthenticated HTTP access to node logs, backups, and employee photographs

#### Vulnerability Note VU#251133

Original Release Date: 2010-06-24 | Last Revised: 2010-07-09

---

### Overview

S2 NetBox and related products do not adequately restrict access to node logs, backups, and employee photographs. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use information obtained from a vulnerable system to aid in further attacks.

### Description

| [S2](http://www.s2sys.com/) NetBox is a line of "...open architecture, scalable, IP network-ready products for the physical security industry that integrate access control, alarm monitoring, video surveillance, and temperature monitoring." S2 Netbox systems are operated entirely via a web interface.  The Netbox web server does not properly authenticate access to several directories, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to access network node logs, employee photographs, and backup archives.Linear (formerly IEI) eMerge is based on S2 Netbox, and Sonitrol eAccess is based on Linear eMerge. eMerge and eAccess may also be affected by this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker can access node logs, backups, and employee photographs. An attacker may be able to crack passwords contained in a backup and gain administrative control over the system. Node logs and employee photographs could provide an attacker with reconnaissance information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or patch**S2 Security has made patches or upgrades available to address this vulnerability for Netbox versions 2.5, 3.3, and 4.0. Please contact S2 or Linear customer support. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restrict network access to S2 Netbox systems to trusted and authorized hosts and networks. Separate management networks from general purpose user networks. Do not allow access from untrusted networks such as the internet. |
