Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2056

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary files by the `gv` software when handling Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Specifically, the temporary file names were predictable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable temporary file names:** The `gv` software used a predictable method for naming temporary files. This allows an attacker to anticipate the name of the temporary file that will be created.
- **Symlink attack:** Due to the predictable temporary file creation, a local attacker could create a symbolic link (symlink) with the same name as the temporary file before `gv` creates it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a potential denial of service. By creating a symlink to a different file (e.g., a critical system file), the attacker could cause `gv` to overwrite that file when it tries to write to its temporary file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack requires a local attacker who has the ability to create files on the same system as the vulnerable `gv` application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where `gv` is running.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create files and symlinks within the system's file system.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to create the malicious symlink before gv creates the temporary file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is related to how gv uses temporary files when opening PDF files.
- The fix involved using `mkstemp()` function to generate random temporary file names instead of predictable ones.
- The issue was fixed in upstream version 3.6.5.90-1, but a related configuration problem in the configure script prevented the fix from functioning correctly.
- The fix was later implemented in gv version 3.7.0, which also addressed CVE-2010-2055.
