## [gv 3.7.0 released (Security Fix) & Translators wanted](forum.php?forum_id=6368)

*Item posted by [Markus Steinborn <msteinbo>](/users/msteinbo) on Sun 06 Jun 2010 05:12:59 PM UTC.*

I am pleased to announce that GNU gv 3.7.0 has just been released. It is available for download in the GNU ftp, ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gv

Note this release fixes security bugs, so you should update if you are using

GNU gv older than version 3.6.91.

Changes in this version:

* GV 3.6.91 has been released as GV 3.7.0 with no changes but

some minor code cleanups.

# Support starting ghostscript from a safe directory.

# ghostscript is started with -P- if SAFER is enabled.

# ghostscript is started with -dSAFER and -dDELAYSAFER for "pdf2dsc"

  and "pdf2ps" if safer is enabled

# Fixes CVE-2010-2055 and CVE-2010-2056.

# Minor bugfixes

# Fix compiling on Mac OS X

# Support for localised user interfaces

As GNU gv now supports localised user interfaces, I am looking for translators.

See  <https://savannah.gnu.org/people/viewjob.php?group_id=7009&job_id=550> for

details.

| Innovation it is always nice. Glad to learn that this release fixes security bugs. I should update it, cause I was using  GNU gv older than version 3.6.91 got by <http://bytesland.com/view/GNU-Open-Subtitle-Translator-Ahashare>  Something makes me think that I will be satisfied with this new version. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 15:57:22 UTC  ``` Paul Szabo reported:   [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583316#10>  a deficiency in the way gv handled temporary file creation, when used for opening Portable Document Format (PDF) files. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks, potentially leading to denial of service (un-athorized overwrite of file content).  References:   [2] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=89;filename=004.diff;att=1;bug=583668>   [3] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=583668#100>  Just for the record from [2]:  <begin quote>  This bug was fixed upstream in 3.6.5.90-1, the first version after lenny. :-(  Attached is a simplified version (without the configure changes as Debian has mkstemp) that should fix this in lenny.  	Bernhard R. Link  <end quote>  and from [3]:  <begin quote>  Just for the records: In 3.6.5.90 (upstream) the configure-script was  broken. Commit 73bb88a65dc1c6c9dc309b60b5454d9475cfccd9 repaired the  defect (and changed other things):  --- a/gv/configure.ac +++ b/gv/configure.ac @@ -92,7 +92,7 @@ AC_CHECK_LIB(Xinerama, main, , , $X_LIBS)   opt_mkstemp=false  -AC_CHECK_FUNCS([mkstemp],[opt_setenv_code=true],[opt_setenv_code=false]) +AC_CHECK_FUNCS([mkstemp],[opt_mkstemp=true],[opt_mkstemp=false])  AM_CONDITIONAL(HAVE_MKSTEMP, test x$opt_mkstemp = xtrue)   So the bugfix was disfunctional until configure.ac has been fixed. :-(   And even worse: Nobody noticed that a rather long time.  <end quote>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 16:02:14 UTC  ``` Relevant upstream changesets are:   [4] <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gv.git/commit/?id=a17416c462e5b6c9cc7c98c5ea01f580152f2da9> (for change mentioned in [2])   [5] <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gv.git/commit/?id=73bb88a65dc1c6c9dc309b60b5454d9475cfccd9> (for change mentioned in [3])   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-03 16:05:58 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the gv package, as shipped with Fedora release of 11, 12, and 13 (they contains upstream changeset from [4], but don't contain upstream changeset from [5], which prevents [4] from proper function).  This issue affects the versions of the gv package, as shipped within EPEL-4 and EPEL-5 repositories (versions here are missing both [4], [5] changes).  Please fix.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c3)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-03 18:18:51 UTC  ``` gv-3.6.91-1.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.6.91-1.fc11>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c4)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-03 18:19:06 UTC  ``` gv-3.6.91-1.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.6.91-1.el5>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c5)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-03 18:19:17 UTC  ``` gv-3.6.91-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.6.91-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c6)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-03 18:19:29 UTC  ``` gv-3.6.91-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.6.91-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c7)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-03 18:19:46 UTC  ``` gv-3.6.91-1.el4 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 4. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.6.91-1.el4>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c8)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-30 17:12:48 UTC  ``` gv-3.7.1-1.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.7.1-1.el5>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c9)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-30 17:13:15 UTC  ``` gv-3.7.1-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.7.1-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c10)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-30 17:13:38 UTC  ``` gv-3.7.1-1.el4 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 4. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.7.1-1.el4>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c11)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-30 17:14:01 UTC  ``` gv-3.7.1-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gv-3.7.1-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=599621#c12)  Fedora Update System    2010-07-08 18:12:07 UTC  ``` gv-3.7.1-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.
