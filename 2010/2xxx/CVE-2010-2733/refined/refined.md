Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2010-2733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation of the HTTP stream in Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG). Specifically, the UAG Web Monitor does not properly sanitize input, allowing for the injection of malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG). This is a non-persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject client-side script in the user's browser, running it under the guise of the UAG server or a third-party website.
- The injected script can spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected website on behalf of the targeted user.
- This could lead to elevation of privilege, allowing the attacker to issue commands to the UAG server in the context of the targeted user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves persuading a user to click a specially crafted URL.
- This can be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Embedding the malicious URL in an email message.
    - Placing the URL on a website controlled by the attacker.
    - Redirecting users to the malicious URL from a compromised website.
- Compromised websites, or websites that accept user-provided content or ads, could also host the malicious content to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the specially crafted URL, either directly or through an intermediary site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that injects script code into the UAG server or third-party website.
- The attacker must also be able to persuade a user to click on this crafted URL.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, only user interaction.
- The vulnerability is present in the UAG Web Monitor, primarily affecting users authorized to access it.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is non-persistent, meaning the malicious script is not permanently stored on the server.
- The update modifies the way the UAG Web Monitor accepts input, addressing the improper input validation issue.
- This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-089.

This detailed explanation provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its implications, and how it can be exploited, according to the provided documents.
