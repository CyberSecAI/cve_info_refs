# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-39

## nsCSSValue::Array index integer overflow

Announced
July 20, 2010
Reporter
J23 (via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative)
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.11
* Firefox 3.6.7
* SeaMonkey 2.0.6
* Thunderbird 3.0.6
* Thunderbird 3.1.1

### Description

Security researcher **J23** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that an array class used to store
CSS values contained an integer overflow vulnerability. The 16 bit
integer value used in allocating the size of the array could overflow,
resulting in too small a memory buffer being created. When the array
was later populated with CSS values data would be written past the end
of the buffer potentially resulting in the execution of
attacker-controlled memory.

# Advisory Details

July 20th, 2010
## Mozilla Firefox CSS font-face Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-133ZDI-CAN-831

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-2752](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2752) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [3.6.x](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['10024']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within handling of references to external font resources. A value is used as a 16 bit integer in an array allocation and later as 32 bit when iterating over and then populating these fields. By creating enough references, a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-06-23 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-07-20 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

Specifications covered:

* CSS Cascading
* CSS Conditional
* CSS Logical Properties
* CSS Namespaces
* CSS Scoping
* CSS Style Attributes
* CSS Syntax
* CSS Values
* CSS Variables

ZDI-CAN-831: Mozilla Firefox CSS font-face Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following
products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within handling of references to external font
resources. A value is used as a 16 bit integer in an array allocation
and later as 32 bit when iterating over and then populating these
fields. By creating enough references, a remote attacker can exploit
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
browser.
Version(s) tested:
00400000 004e0000 firefox (deferred)
Image path: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
Image name: firefox.exe
Timestamp: Thu Apr 01 10:38:42 2010 (4BB4BE02)
CheckSum: 000EA924
ImageSize: 000E0000
File version: 1.9.2.3743
Product version: 3.6.3.0
Platform(s) tested:
Windows XP SP3 x86
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/source/layout/style/nsCSSParser.cpp#7893>
// alloc:
7892 nsRefPtr<nsCSSValue::Array> srcVals

We should probably just change nsCSSValue::Array to PRUint32. It was originally intended for only fixed-size things, but now it's being used for three things of author-controlled size: 'src' and 'unicode-range' inside @font-face, and min()/max() inside -moz-calc().

This switches to size\_t, which I think is the right thing to use for things like this (and we should tend to switch). It might be larger than PRUint32, but it shouldn't be smaller on any platforms we support, and I think a mismatch that way around is ok.

Why does size\_t make sense for the refcount?

The size of the address space limits the number of objects that could own a reference to something.

OK, I buy that. We should consider using size\_t for refcounts in general, then, and use the macros here. Separate bug?
