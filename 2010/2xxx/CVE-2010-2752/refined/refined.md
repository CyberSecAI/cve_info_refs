Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-2752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `nsCSSValue::Array` class used to store CSS values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code uses a 16-bit integer to allocate the size of an array. This 16-bit value can overflow if the requested size exceeds its maximum capacity. Later on, the code uses a 32 bit integer when iterating over and populating these fields. This can lead to the creation of a buffer that is too small.
*   **Heap Overflow:** When the array is populated with CSS values, data can be written beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The heap overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could create a malicious web page containing specially crafted CSS that triggers the integer overflow.
*   **Malicious Files:** The vulnerability could also be exploited through malicious files, possibly by opening a specially crafted HTML or SVG file that uses malicious CSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the malicious content, i.e., visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
*   **CSS Injection:** The attacker must be able to inject CSS into the page, for example through `@font-face` or other means that use `nsCSSValue::Array`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by J23 through TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   The vulnerability affects Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird.
*   The fix involves switching to `size_t` for array allocation and iteration, which is a more appropriate type for size calculations.
*   Patches were created for Firefox 3.5.x and 3.6.x, SeaMonkey 2.0.6, and Thunderbird 3.0.6 and 3.1.1
*   The affected code is in the `layout/style/nsCSSParser.cpp` file.
*   The vulnerability is related to handling references to external font resources in CSS and also to a related issue with `min()/max()` inside `-moz-calc()`.
