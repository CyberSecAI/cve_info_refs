  "CVE-2010-2500": {
    "description": "Robert Święcki discovered that FreeType did not correctly handle certain malformed font files. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted font file, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in `src/smooth/ftgrays.c` due to multiplication of `map->rows - 1` and `map->pitch`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write."
    ],
    "impact": "Potential arbitrary code execution with user privileges, denial of service via application crashes.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted font file",
      "User interaction required to load the malicious font file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious font file and trick the user to load it.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered in `gray_render_span` function in `ftgrays.c` where an integer overflow occurs when calculating an offset into a bitmap buffer. The fix involves casting the multiplication result to an `unsigned int`. The vulnerable code was present since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and could be triggered with `MALLOC_CHECK_=3`.  A related issue with large bitmaps is addressed by reducing the threshold values for `width` and `height` in `ft_smooth_render_generic` function in `ftsmooth.c`.  The vulnerability is fixed in FreeType 2.4.0."
