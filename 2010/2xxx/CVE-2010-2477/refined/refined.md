Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-2477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `paste.httpexceptions` module in Python Paste was using insecure quoting of parameters when generating HTTP error messages, specifically 404 (Not Found) messages. This allowed for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability due to improper sanitization of input parameters in the `paste.httpexceptions` module, specifically when constructing error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when processed by a vulnerable application, would cause the victim's browser to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
*  **Modify Content/Steal Data:** An attacker could exploit the XSS vulnerability to modify page content or steal sensitive information within the same domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Formed URLs:** The attack vector involves crafting specific URLs that trigger the vulnerable code paths in `paste.httpexceptions`.
*   **Directing Victims to Malicious URLs:** Attackers must direct victims to visit these crafted URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** An attacker needs to know that an application is using a vulnerable version of Paste, especially `paste.urlparse.StaticURLParser`, `PkgResourcesParser`, or `paste.urlmap.URLMap` (with no application attached to `/`).
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker must be capable of crafting malicious URLs to exploit the vulnerability, including injecting JavaScript within the URL parameters.
*   **Social Engineering (Optional):** The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the crafted URL (e.g., through phishing or other social engineering techniques).

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was specifically found in how Paste handles 404 messages.
*   `paste.urlparse.StaticURLParser` and `PkgResourcesParser` are specifically mentioned as being affected, as well as `paste.urlmap.URLMap` if it lacks an application mounted on /.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Tim Wintle and Georg-Christian Pranschke.
*   Paste version 1.7.4 was released to address this vulnerability.
*   The fix involves proper quoting in `paste/httpexceptions.py`, `paste/urlmap.py`, and `paste/util/quoting.py`.
*   Ubuntu also released a security update for python-paste in Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid) with version 1.7.2-4ubuntu1.2.
