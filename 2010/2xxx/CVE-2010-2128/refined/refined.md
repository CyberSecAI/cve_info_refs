RELATED: CVE-2010-2128

The provided content from Exploit Database describes a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the JE Quotation Form 1.0b1 component for Joomla.

Vulnerability Details:
- Vulnerability: Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Component: Joomla! Component JE Quotation Form 1.0b1
- Attack Vector: By manipulating the 'view' parameter in the URL, an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server.
- Impact: An attacker could potentially read sensitive files (e.g., /etc/passwd) from the server.
- Attack Example:
  http://site/index.php?option=com_jequoteform&view=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
- Root cause: Insufficient input validation of the `view` parameter, allowing directory traversal. The use of `%00` (null byte) is intended to truncate the file path after the attacker-controlled input, preventing any appended extensions or path restrictions.
- Required capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to access the web server and modify the URL parameters.
