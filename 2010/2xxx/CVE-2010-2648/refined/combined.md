How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1006-1: WebKit vulnerabilities

19 October 2010

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

* [webkit](/security/cves?package=webkit) -

## Details

A large number of security issues were discovered in the WebKit browser and

JavaScript engines. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious

website, a remote attacker could exploit a variety of issues related to web

browser security, including cross-site scripting attacks, denial of

service attacks, and arbitrary code execution.

Please consult the bug listed at the top of this advisory to get the exact

list of CVE numbers fixed for each release.

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that

use WebKit, such as Epiphany and Midori, to make all the necessary changes.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- samba
A buffer overflow in the sid\_parse() function of samba could
potentially be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2010-3069).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- libgdiplus0
Specially crafted tiff, jpeg and bmp images could cause integer overflows in
ligdiplus0 (CVE-2010-1526).
- libwebkit
The browser engine libwebkit was updated to version 1.2.4 to fix
several security bugs.
(CVE-2010-1781, CVE-2010-1782, CVE-2010-1784, CVE-2010-1785
CVE-2010-1786, CVE-2010-1787, CVE-2010-1788, CVE-2010-1790
CVE-2010-1792, CVE-2010-1793, CVE-2010-2648)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- bzip2
Specially crafted bz2 archives could cause a denial of service or
potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code in applications
that try to unpack such archives (CVE-2010-0405).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- php5
PHP was updated to version 5.2.14 to fix several security issues
(CVE-2010-1860, CVE-2010-1862, CVE-2010-1864, CVE-2010-1914,

CVE-2010-3062, CVE-2010-3063, CVE-2010-3064, CVE-2010-3065).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- okular
Specially crafted PDF files could cause a heap overflow in okular
(CVE-2010-2575).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.
