The provided content is related to CVE-2010-1206.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Firefox's improper handling of HTTP 204 ("No Content") responses and the `window.stop()` method in conjunction with `window.open()`. When a new window is opened with `window.open()`, Firefox displays the target URL in the address bar before the document is loaded. If the document load results in a 204 response or is immediately stopped using `window.stop()`, the browser fails to clear the displayed address, leading to a spoofed address bar.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Address bar spoofing: The browser displays a URL in the address bar that does not correspond to the actual content being displayed.
- Improper handling of HTTP 204 responses
- Incorrect behavior when `window.stop()` is called immediately after `window.open()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can mislead users into believing they are on a legitimate website when they are actually on a malicious page. This could enable phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering.

**Attack vectors:**
- Using JavaScript to open a new window with `window.open()` to a target URL and then either:
    - Sending a HTTP 204 response
    - Using javascript to call `window.stop()` on the newly opened window.
- Combining with `setTimeout` calls and modifying the content of the new window to display a fake webpage, while the address bar shows the original target URL.
- Using an `<a>` tag with `target="foo"` combined with the above methods.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the user's browser.
- The attacker needs to be able to either control a server to return HTTP 204 responses, or use the `window.stop()` javascript command.
