Subject: CVE request: kernel: btrfs

Fixes for two issues in btrfs were committed upstream:

1.  The BTRFS_IOC_CLONE and BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctls allowed a
local user to overwrite append-only files.

2.  The BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctl was subject to an integer overflow
in specifying offsets to copy from a file, which potentially allows a
local user to read sensitive filesystem data.

2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1041-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

10 January 2011

Multiple security flaws in Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Louis Rilling and Matthieu Fertré reported a use after free error in the

Linux kernel's futex\_wait function. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a

specially crafted application. ([CVE-2014-0205](/security/CVE-2014-0205))

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly filter

registers on 64bit kernels when performing 32bit system calls. On a 64bit

system, a local attacker could manipulate 32bit system calls to gain root

privileges. ([CVE-2010-3301](/security/CVE-2010-3301))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the btrfs filesystem did not correctly

validate permissions when using the clone function. A local attacker could

overwrite the contents of file handles that were opened for append-only, or

potentially read arbitrary contents, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2010-2537](/security/CVE-2010-2537), [CVE-2010-2538](/security/CVE-2010-2538))

Dave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not correctly order

inode lookups when exported by NFS. A remote attacker could exploit this to

read or write disk blocks that had changed file assignment or had become

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 10.10 kernel updates have been given a new version number,

which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel

modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules,

you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with

the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard

kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc),

a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=616998#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-07-21 21:25:19 UTC  ``` Description of problem: 1. [CVE-2010-2537](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2537) - The BTRFS_IOC_CLONE and BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctls should check whether the donor file is append-only before writing to it.  2. [CVE-2010-2538](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2538) - The BTRFS_IOC_CLONE_RANGE ioctl appears to have an integer overflow that allows a user to specify an out-of-bounds range to copy from the source file (if off + len wraps around).  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/2ebc3464781ad24474abcbd2274e6254689853b5>  Reference: <https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page>  The kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has support for Btrfs by default.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=616998#c1)  Petr Matousek    2010-07-21 21:25:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include support for Btrfs, a new copy on write filesystem.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=616998#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-02 03:50:04 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for responsibly reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=616998#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-02 03:57:52 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 616992](show_bug.cgi?id=616992 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2010-2537 kernel: btrfs: check for append only file in the clone ioctl") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=616998#c6)  Chuck Ebbert    2010-08-02 21:14:24 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in 2.6.35, 2.6.34.2, 2.6.33.7 and 2.6.32.17   ``` |  |
