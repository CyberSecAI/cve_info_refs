  "CVE-2010-2575": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the okular document viewer when processing images embedded in PDB files. This is caused by a boundary error during RLE decompression in the 'TranscribePalmImageToJPEG()' function. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDB file.",
