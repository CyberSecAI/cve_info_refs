Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a local file inclusion (LFI) flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This is achieved by manipulating the `default_cms_lang` parameter in the `addbookmark.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially gaining access to configuration files, source code, database credentials, or other confidential information.
- **Full Server Compromise:** By including specific files (e.g., PHP scripts), an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `addbookmark.php` script.
- **`default_cms_lang` Parameter Manipulation:** The `default_cms_lang` parameter is used to inject a path to the file the attacker wants to include. The provided Proof of Concept uses `../` sequences to traverse directories and also includes a null byte to truncate the path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CMS Made Simple instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `default_cms_lang` parameter in the `addbookmark.php` script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as an "old" issue affecting multiple previous versions of CMS Made Simple.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the exploit using HTTP requests to read the `win.ini` file, a common example of local file inclusion.
- The fix for this vulnerability was released in CMS Made Simple version 1.8.1.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion vulnerability that is triggered via the `default_cms_lang` parameter. An attacker can leverage this to read sensitive files from the server or potentially achieve code execution.
