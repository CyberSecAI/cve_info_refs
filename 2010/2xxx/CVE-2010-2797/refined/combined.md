    High quality and thoughtful construction ensures your water will never come into contact with anything but stainless steel and glass. Most water distillers priced bet. $199 - $400 have a plastic boiling chamber, plastic internal dome and bottom, and polycarbonate carafe to collect the steam. Plastic and polycarbonate bottles leach toxins into the water, especially when heated.

    Ho Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups. Originally known as Prey Nokor while part of the Khmer Empire,[nb 2] it came to be dubbed Sài Gòn informally by Vietnamese settlers from the north. In the 1690s, Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyen rulers of Huế to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the Mekong Delta and its surroundings. Control of the city and the area passed to the Vietnamese, who gave the city the official name of Gia Định (Chữ Nôm: 嘉 定).

    Evidence of human habitation in Malaysia dates back 40,000 years,[29] with the first inhabitants thought to be Negritos.[30] Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the 1st century AD, establishing trading ports and towns in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. This resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influence on the local cultures, and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism.

    The common name was recorded from the early 19th century in the Falkland Islands. English sailors apparently named the species for its conspicuous yellow crest;[5] Maccaronism was a term for a particular style in 18th-century England marked by flamboyant or excessive ornamentation. A person who adopted this fashion was labelled a maccaroni or macaroni, as in the song "'Yankee Doodle".[6]

    Parliament two factions had emerged—the Tories and Whigs. The former were royalists while the latter were classical liberals. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king James II, some of them, along with the Whigs, deposed him in the Revolution of 1688 and invited Dutch prince William III to become monarch. Some English people, especially in the north, were Jacobites and continued to support James and his sons. After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed,[67] the two countries joined in political union, to create the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707.[61] To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national church of each remained separate.

    If it collides with a peak, then the wave height is increased and if it collides with a trough, then its height is decreased. In the diagram on the right, the two waves cancel each other out creating a flat surface however this is a highly simplified version of events. The incoming wave has the same wave period as the edge wave, so the incoming wave changes from a peak to a trough over the same period as it takes the standing wave to change so they keep the same pattern. These are known as synchronous waves and are very uncommon.

 **NOTE:** This release fixes an important security vulnerability, we recommend that ALL users upgrade as soon as possible. The local inclusion vulnerability fixed is old and affects many previous versions of CMSMS. Therefore it is important for **ALL** installations to be upgraded as soon as possible. This release also fixes all of the issues encountered with the CMSMS 1.8 release due to the overhaul of the translation function. Your performance in the admin section should be back to normal following this upgrade. Below is a complete list of the remaining issues that have been addressed in this release, enjoy.
### Version 1.8.1 - Mankara

**Security:**

* Fixed local inclusion security flaw

 **Fixes:**

* Backend behaved slower then previous release
* Core modules/tabs in the backend weren't translated
* Internet Explorer didn't show specific backend-pages properly (f.e. News)
* Theme: "default" gave message "Undefined index: direction" at the top of the admin area
* The content tag didn't allow an underscore in name of a content block
* Default content had News categories in summary-template
* "Expand/Collapse" buttons added to top of listcontent.php (Admin --> Content --> Pages) for usability improvement
* User preference for page-limit when viewing the templates list wasn't followed
* Additional blocks were not visible in Content Edit mode, when underscore was used

### Version 1.6.8 - Pouebo

As promised, we added this security fix to the 1.6.x series for those that still require PHP4. The new version with the security fixes is **1.6.8**.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 NOTE: This release fixes an important security vulnerability,
we recommend that ALL users upgrade as soon as possible.

The local inclusion vulnerability fixed is old and affects many
previous versions of CMSMS. Therefore it is important for ALL
installations to be upgraded as soon as possible.

This release also fixes all of the issues encountered with the
CMSMS 1.8 release due to the overhaul of the translation function.
Your performance in the admin section should be back to normal
following this upgrade.

Below is a complete list of the remaining issues that have been
addressed in this release, enjoy.

Version 1.8.1 - Mankara

Security:

    Fixed local inclusion security flaw
