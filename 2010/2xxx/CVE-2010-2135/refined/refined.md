Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the login functionality of HazelPress Lite version 0.0.4 and earlier.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user inputs in the login process, specifically the username and password fields.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can bypass authentication. This means they can gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative functions without knowing the valid login credentials.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the application's login page (`login.php`). The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the username and password fields.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the login page. No prior authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to input text to the username and password fields.

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to bypass authentication by using the following input:

*   **Username:** `' or '1=1`
*   **Password:** `' or '1=1`

This input leverages SQL syntax to create a condition that always evaluates to true, effectively bypassing the normal authentication check.
