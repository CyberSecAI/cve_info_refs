## Accoria Rock Web Server contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#245081

Original Release Date: 2010-06-01 | Last Revised: 2010-06-22

---

### Overview

Accoria Web Server contains multiple vulnerabilities that collectively could allow an attacker to execute commands through the administration interface.

### Description

| The Accoria web server, also known as Rock Web Server, contains several cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (XSRF) vulnerabilities. Directory traversal and format string vulnerabilities exist as well. The getenv sample code contains an XSS vulnerability when viewed by Internet Explorer 6 or other web browsers that do not follow [RFC 2616 Section 7.2.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-7.2.1). Generated cookies appear to be weak and predictable, which may allow an attacker to bypass authentication.  Further details are available from the [IOActive security advisory](http://www.ioactive.com/pdfs/AccoriaWebServer.pdf). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote and unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute commands in the context of the web server administrator. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vendor recommends all users upgrade to version 1.5.2 or later. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**  Appropriate firewall rules should be set up to limit access to the web server's administration interface to only trusted sources. **XSRF protection**To avoid XSRF attacks, do not click on links from untrusted sources while logged into the administration interface. |
