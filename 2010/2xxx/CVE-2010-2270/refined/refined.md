{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Accoria web server, also known as Rock Web Server, contains multiple vulnerabilities including XSS, XSRF, directory traversal, and format string vulnerabilities. Weak and predictable cookies allow for authentication bypass.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
    "Cross-site request forgery (XSRF)",
    "Directory traversal",
    "Format string vulnerability",
    "Weak and predictable cookies"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote and unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute commands in the context of the web server administrator.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities through crafted requests",
     "Exploiting XSRF vulnerabilities by tricking authenticated users into making unintended requests",
    "Directory traversal to access restricted files",
     "Format string vulnerability to cause unexpected program behavior",
    "Bypassing authentication using weak cookies"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker."
