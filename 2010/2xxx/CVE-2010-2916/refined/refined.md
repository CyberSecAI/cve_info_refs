{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'news.php' script, specifically in the 'id' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the 'news.php?id' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by exploiting the blind SQL injection vulnerability. This is achieved by injecting SQL queries into the vulnerable parameter and observing the application's response to determine the validity of the injected logic.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the 'news.php' script with a malicious SQL query in the 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and observe the application's responses. No authentication or special positioning is explicitly stated as required."
