# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-079 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2293194)

Published: October 12, 2010 | Updated: November 03, 2010

**Version:** 1.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves eleven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Word 2002, Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; and all supported versions of Microsoft Office Word Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office Word parses specially crafted Word files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2293194](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2293194) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**MS10-072 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Web Apps. How does MS10-072 relate to this bulletin (MS10-079)?**

The security update package in this bulletin, MS10-079, for Microsoft Office Web Apps (KB2346411) also addresses the vulnerabilities described in MS10-072. Users with Microsoft Office Web Apps installed will only need to install the KB2346411 security update package once.

**MS10-080 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. How does MS10-080 relate to this bulletin (MS10-079)?**

The security update packages in this bulletin, MS10-079, for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2422343), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB2422352), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB2422398) also address the vulnerabilities described in MS10-080. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, or Open XML File Format Converter for Mac installed will only need to install these security update packages once.

**What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File** **Formats are updated by this bulletin?**

The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.

**What is the Microsoft Word Viewer?**

The Microsoft Word Viewer is a replacement for Word Viewer 2003 and all previous Word Viewer versions. With Word Viewer, you can view, print, and copy Word documents, even if you do not have Word installed. For more details about currently supported Office viewers, see Supported versions of the Office viewers.

**What is Microsoft Office Web Apps?**

Microsoft Office Web Apps is the online companion to Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote applications that enables users regardless of their location to access documents and edit documents. Users can view, share, and work on documents with others online across personal computers, mobile phones, and the Web. Office Web Apps is available to business customers with Microsoft Office 2010 volume licensing and document management solutions based on Microsoft SharePoint 2010 products.

**What is Microsoft Word Web App?**

Microsoft Word Web App is part of Microsoft Office Web Apps, available in organizations that have configured Office Web Apps on Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010. Word Web App extends your Microsoft Word experience to the Web browser, where you can work with documents directly on the website where the document is stored. For more information about Word Web App, see [Introduction to Word Web App](https://office.microsoft.com/web-apps-help/introduction-to-word-web-app-ha010378341.aspx).

**Where are updates for Microsoft Office Web Apps applied?**

Customers who have deployed Microsoft Office Web Apps in a SharePoint environment will need to apply the updates for Microsoft Office Web Apps on the servers on which those components are installed. For more information about deploying Microsoft Web Apps, see the Microsoft TechNet article, [Understanding Office Web Apps](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff431685.aspx).

**Note** The updates for Microsoft Office Web Apps do not apply to the client workstations that use a Web browser to access Microsoft Office Web Apps.

**How are Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?**

A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Word is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Word that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.

**The Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## Word Uninitialized Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2747

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Word handles an uninitialized pointer when parsing a specially crafted Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-2747](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2747).

#### Workarounds for Word Stack Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3214

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  **For Office 2003**

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000

  ```

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.

  **For Office 2007**

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000

  ```

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, all of the latest security updates for the 2007 Microsoft Office system must be applied.

  **For Office 2010**
  Open Word 2010 and follow the steps below:

  1. Click the **File** tab.
  2. Under **Help**, click **Options**.
  3. Click **TrustCenter**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
  4. In the Trust Center, click **File Block Settings**.
  5. Ensure the **Open** check box is selected for the following file types:
     + Word 2003 Binary Documents and Templates
     + Word XP Binary Documents and Templates
     + Word 2000 Binary Documents and Templates
     + Word 97 Binary Documents and Templates
     + Word 95 Binary Documents and Templates
     + Word 6.0 Binary Documents and Templates
     + Word 2 and earlier Binary Documents and Templates
  6. Under Open behavior for selected file types, select "Do not open selected file types" or select "Open selected file types in Protected View" (either choice will block the attack vector to the vulnerable code).
  7. Click **OK** to apply the File Block Settings.

  Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, [Plan file block settings for Office 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179230.aspx).

  **Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special "exempt directory" as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2007, Office 2003 or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  For Office 2003

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

  ```

  For Office 2007

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock]

  "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

  ```

  For Office 2010
  Open Word 2010 and follow these steps:

  1. Click the **File** tab.
  2. Under **Help**, click **Options**.
  3. Click **TrustCenter**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
  4. In the Trust Center, click **File Block Settings**.
  5. Clear the **Open** check box for the file types that you previously selected.
  6. Click **OK** to apply the File Block settings.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.

To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** or **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
