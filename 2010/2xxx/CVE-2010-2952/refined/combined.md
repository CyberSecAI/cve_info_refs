How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Apache Traffic Serverâ¢ software is a fast, scalable and extensible HTTP/1.1 and
HTTP/2 compliant caching
proxy server. Formerly a commercial product, Yahoo! donated it to the Apache
Foundation, and currently used by several major CDNs and content owners.

# Overview

* **Caching**

  Improve your response time, while reducing server load and bandwidth needs by
  caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages, images, and web service
  calls.
* **Proxying**

  Easily add keep-alive, filter or anonymize content requests, or add load
  balancing by adding a proxy layer.

* **Fast**

  Scales well on modern SMP hardware, handling 10s of thousands of requests per
  second.
* **Extensible**

  APIs to write your own plug-ins to do anything from modifying HTTP headers to
  handling ESI requests to writing your own cache algorithm.

* **Proven**

  Handling over 400TB a day at [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/) both as
  forward and reverse proxies, Apache Traffic Server is battle
  hardened. Also visit our [Customers page](users.html) for
  some of our corporate users and supporters.
