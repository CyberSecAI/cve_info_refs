{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the browsers' handling of 'news' and 'nntp' protocols, specifically when a large number of iframes are used to trigger the protocol handlers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities due to blocking and resource consumption. The browsers' improper handling of protocol handlers for 'news' and 'nntp' allows for resource exhaustion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to system blocking and overloading. In some cases, like IE8, the browser can crash. Opera experiences resource consumption without blocking.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack can be performed by creating a webpage containing a large number of iframes that trigger the 'news' or 'nntp' protocol handlers. This can be done with or without JavaScript.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create or control a web page that a victim will visit via their web browser. No special privileges are required."
