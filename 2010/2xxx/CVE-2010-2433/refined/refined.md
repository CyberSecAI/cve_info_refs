```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The error handling mechanism embeds user-supplied data (from GET or POST requests) directly into the webpage, allowing the execution of injected JavaScript code.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- Attack vectors: By embedding malicious JavaScript code within a URL, this code is then included in the error message. The vulnerability is present on the `explore.jsp`, `compose.jsp`, and `home.jsp` pages.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL or a POST request that includes malicious JavaScript code which is then used in the error message.
