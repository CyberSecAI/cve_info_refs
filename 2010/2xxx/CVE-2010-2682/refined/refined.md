- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Joomla component `com_realtyna` is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient input sanitization in the `controller` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `controller` parameter, which could expose sensitive information such as configuration files, system files or even application source code.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a URL with the vulnerable parameter `controller` set to a path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla server. No authentication is required.
