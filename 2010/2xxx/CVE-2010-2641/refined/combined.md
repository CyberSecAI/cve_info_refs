Package        : evince
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-2640 CVE-2010-2641 CVE-2010-2642 CVE-2010-264320
Debian Bug     : 609534

Jon Larimer from IBM X-Force Advanced Research discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in the DVI backend of the evince document viewer:

CVE-2010-2640

    Insuficient array bounds checks in the PK fonts parser could lead
    to function pointer overwrite, causing arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2010-2641

    Insuficient array bounds checks in the PK fonts parser could lead
    to function pointer overwrite, causing arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2010-2642

    Insuficient bounds checks in the AFM fonts parser when writing
    data to a memory buffer allocated on heap could lead to arbitrary
    memory overwrite and arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2010-2643

    Insuficient check on an integer used as a size for memory
    allocation can lead to arbitrary write outside the allocated range
    and cause arbitrary code execution.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.22.2-4~lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), CVE-2010-2640, CVE-2010-2641
and CVE-2010-2643 have been fixed in version 2.30.3-2 but the fix for
CVE-2010-2642 was incomplete. The final fix is present in version
2.30.3-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your evince packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=666314#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2010-12-30 05:01:16 UTC  ``` An array index error in the parser for VF font files, which is used for rendering DVI files, in the GNOME evince document viewer can lead to local or remote code execution. Due to insufficient bounds checks when writing to elements in an array, it's possible to overwrite the address of a function pointer, leading to possible arbitrary code execution.  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-2641](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2641) to this issue.  The vulnerability is present in the code that handles loading of fonts used by DVI files.To exploit you need two files, a DVI file and the malicious font. The vulnerability is triggered not only by opening the document in evince, but also by browsing to a folder which contains the malicious files, where evince thumbnailer will load the malicious file to generate a thumbnail for it.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=666314#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-01-06 02:51:44 UTC  ``` Public via: <http://git.gnome.org/browse/evince/commit/?id=d4139205b010ed06310d14284e63114e88ec6de2>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=666314#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-01-06 03:00:33 UTC  ``` Created evince tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 667573](show_bug.cgi?id=667573 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2641 CVE-2010-2642 CVE-2010-2640 CVE-2010-2643 evince various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=666314#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-01-06 18:28:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0009 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0009.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=666314#c8)  Huzaifa S.

# USN-1035-1: Evince vulnerabilities

5 January 2011

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [evince](/security/cves?package=evince) -

## Details

Jon Larimer discovered that Evince's font parsers incorrectly handled

certain buffer lengths when rendering a DVI file. By tricking a user into

opening or previewing a DVI file that uses a specially crafted font file,

an attacker could crash evince or execute arbitrary code with the user's

privileges.

In the default installation of Ubuntu 9.10 and later, attackers would be

isolated by the Evince AppArmor profile.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [evince](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/evince)
  -
  [2.28.1-0ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/evince/2.28.1-0ubuntu1.3)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [evince](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/evince)
  -
  [2.22.2-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/evince/2.22.2-0ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [evince](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/evince)
  -
  [2.32.0-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/evince/2.32.0-0ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [evince](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/evince)
  -
  [2.30.3-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/evince/2.30.3-0ubuntu1.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
