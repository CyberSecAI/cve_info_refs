  "CVE-2010-2063": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overrun was possible in chain_reply code.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (memory corruption and daemon crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted network traffic (SMB1 packets).",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated remote attacker."

    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the way Samba handles certain offset values when processing chained SMB1 packets.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of offset values leading to memory corruption.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can write to an arbitrary memory location, leading to potential arbitrary code execution with root privileges or denial-of-service by crashing the Samba daemon.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted SMB1 packets over the network.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated remote attacker."
    },
{
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow exists in Samba's handling of SMB1 packets.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient validation of SMB1 packet contents.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code as the root user.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending a maliciously crafted SMB1 packet.",
