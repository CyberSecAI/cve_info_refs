Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the PHP-Calendar blog post, which are related to CVE-2010-2041:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **XSS in Subject:** Failure to properly escape HTML entities in event subjects, likely introduced during UTF-8 support implementation and not re-enabled after debugging.
*   **Open Redirect on Login:** Lack of validation for the `lastaction` parameter during login, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that redirects the user to an arbitrary location after login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the improper handling of HTML entities in the subject field of events. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the subject field which would then be executed by the victim's browser when viewing the event.
*   **Open Redirection:**  The lack of validation on the `lastaction` parameter during login creates an open redirection vulnerability. This can be used to redirect users to phishing sites or other malicious locations, potentially allowing for credential theft or malware distribution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or theft of sensitive information.
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker could lure users to a legitimate login page with a crafted URL that will redirect the user after successful login to a malicious site. This could be used to steal login credentials or trick users into revealing other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript into the subject field of a calendar event.
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker would craft a malicious URL with a controlled `lastaction` parameter to the login page, which, upon successful login, redirects the user to an arbitrary location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker would need the ability to create or modify calendar events to inject the malicious script into the subject field.
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker needs to convince the user to click on a crafted login URL.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerabilities were discovered by VUPEN.
* The fix is mentioned in the context of the release notes for PHP-Calendar 2.0 Beta7
