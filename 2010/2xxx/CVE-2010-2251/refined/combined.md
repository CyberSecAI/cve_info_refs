As far as I'm aware, at the time of the initial oCERT notification, the
wget upstream was represented by Micah Cowan, who was about to resign.
And he did:

<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2010-04/msg00027.html>

oCERT has re-notified the new upstream shortly before publishing the
advisory (we decided this was not enough of a reason to introduce a
further pre-public-disclosure delay).  I don't think the new wget
upstream has made a determination on this issue yet; at least I'm not
aware of that.

...

For those producing back-ports for lftp, the approach to take is to
download 4.0.5 and 4.0.6 from:

<http://ftp.yars.free.net/pub/source/lftp/old/>

Then diff them with:

diff -purx configure -x po -x 'Makefile*' -x '*.in' -x '*.in.h' -x m4 -x lib -x \
build-aux -x '*.m4' lftp-4.0.5 lftp-4.0.6

This is a small and relevant diff, which should be easy to manually turn
into a patch for just the relevant changes.  The NEWS file mentions these:

* use O_EXCL flag when xfer:clobber is off.
* better validation of server-provided file name.
* new setting xfer:auto-rename (off by default).

All three of the above are relevant, especially the last one.  A test
case is downloading WordPress with:

lftpget <http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz>

Vulnerable lftp will silently produce a file named like
wordpress-2.9.2.tar.gz instead of latest.tar.gz.  Fixed lftp will
produce latest.tar.gz unless the user explicitly sets xfer:auto-rename.

For Owl, we simply updated to lftp 4.0.7.  Our -stable branch uses a
too-old lftp (not yet vulnerable), so we did not require a back-port.

When testing tools other than lftp, please note that the WordPress test
case tests for one of two attack-usable HTTP headers only
(Content-Disposition but not Location).  We did test a handful of other
tools, but only three - lftp, lwp-download, wget - were found vulnerable.
curl, ELinks were found not vulnerable.  Lynx was inconclusive in Hank's
testing (and we did not investigate further).

Apologies to oCERT and everyone else for being so terrible at handling
this.

CVE-2010-2251 - lftp
CVE-2010-2252 - wget

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.

Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- lxsession
lxsession-logout did not properly lock the screen before suspending,
hibernating and switching between users which could allow attackers with
physical access to take control of the system to obtain sensitive infor-
mation and / or execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who is
currently logged in (CVE-2010-2532).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- mono-addon-bytefx-data-mysql/bytefx-data-mysql
Mono's ASP.NET implementation did not set the 'EnableViewStateMac'
property by default. Attackers could exploit that to conduct cross-
site-scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2010-1459)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

which allows remote HTTP servers to obtain sensitive
information via a crafted document.
- CVE-2010-1993: Opera 9.52 does not properly handle an IFRAME element
with a mailto: URL in its SRC attribute, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via an HTML document with many IFRAME
elements.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs

allow remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code via
unspecified vectors. (CVE-2010-0438)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- popt
This update fixes the problem where RPM misses to clear the SUID/SGID
bit of old files during package updates. (CVE-2010-2059)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
This update of postgresql was pblished to fix several minor security
vulnerabilities:
- CVE-2010-1975: postgresql does not properly check privileges during
certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.
- CVE-2010-1169: Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures,
which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- python-mako
Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly
escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- vte
VTE was vulnerable to an old title set+query attack which could be used
by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2713).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- w3m
w3m did not handle embedded nul characters in the common name and in
subject alternative names of x509 certificates.
CVE-2010-2074 has been assigned to this issue.
This update also turns on verification of x509 certificates by default
which was not the case before.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- xmlrpc-c
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=== Content from www.ocert.org_bf5c0beb_20250125_122830.html ===


**oCERT-2010-001 multiple http client unexpected download filename**

**Description**:

The [lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru), [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget)
and [lwp-download](http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl/bin/lwp-download)
applications are FTP/HTTP clients and file transfer tools supporting
various network protocols. The lwp-download script is shipped along
with the [libwww-perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl)
library.

Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling
the Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested
filename' functionality.

Additionally, unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and
lwp-download in the case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file
downloading. The two applications automatically use the URL's filename
portion specified in the Location header.

Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file
that differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by
the user. This can be used by an attacker-controlled server to silently
write hidden and/or initialization files under the user's current
directory (e.g. .login, .bashrc).

The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of
lftp/lftpget as the default configuration allows file to be overwritten
without prompting the user for confirmation. In the case of lftp the
get1 command is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the
user from lftp's command line interface or indirectly by using the
lftpget script, packaged within the lftp distribution.

**Affected version**:

[lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru) <= 4.0.5

[wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget) <= 1.12

[libwww-perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl) <= 5.834

**Fixed version**:

[lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru) >= 4.0.6

[wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget) N/A

[libwww-perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl) >= 5.835

**Credit**: vulnerability discovered and reported by Hank
Leininger and Solar Designer under the Openwall Project, with further
analysis by Daniele Bianco of oCERT.

**CVE**: [CVE-2010-2251](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2251) (lftp), [CVE-2010-2252](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2252) (wget), [CVE-2010-2253](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2253) (libwww-perl)

**Timeline**:

2009-10-23: vulnerability report received

2010-01-08: further investigations and analysis completed

2010-01-10: contacted wget, libwww-perl and lftp maintainers

2010-01-11: wget didn't acknowledge the report, the issues reported
have not been considered relevant from a security
perspective by the maintainer

2010-01-21: lftp acknowledged the report, preliminary analysis for the
reported issues provided

2010-02-06: wget confirmed the application will not be fixed

2010-02-08: libwww-perl acknowledged the report, preliminary analysis
for the reported issues provided

2010-03-25: lftp 4.0.6 released

2010-05-05: libwww-perl-5.836 released

2010-05-10: contacted affected vendors

2010-05-14: failure reported during notification process of vendor-sec
list, notification re-sent

2010-05-17: advisory published

2010-06-09: assigned CVE

#2010-001 multiple http client unexpected download filename vulnerability

Description:

The lftp, wget and lwp-download applications are ftp/http clients and file
transfer tools supporting various network protocols. The lwp-download
script is shipped along with the libwww-perl library.

Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling the
Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested filename'
functionality.

Additionally, unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and lwp-download in
the case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file downloading. The two
applications automatically use the URL's filename portion specified in the
Location header.

Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file that
differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by the user.
This can be used by an attacker-controlled server to silently write hidden
and/or initialization files under the user's current directory
(e.g. .login, .bashrc).

The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of lftp/lftpget
as the default configuration allows file to be overwritten without
prompting the user for confirmation. In the case of lftp the get1 command
is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the user from lftp's
command line interface or indirectly by using the lftpget script, packaged
within the lftp distribution.

Affected version:

lftp <= 4.0.5

wget <= 1.12

libwww-perl <= 5.834

Fixed version:

lftp >= 4.0.6

wget N/A

libwww-perl >= 5.835

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2085-1                security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                     Sebastien Delafond
August 03, 2010                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : lftp
Vulnerability  : missing input validation
Problem type   : remote (local)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2010-2251

It was discovered that in lftp, a command-line HTTP/FTP client, there is
no proper validation of the filename provided by the server through the
Content-Disposition header; attackers can use this flaw by suggesting a
filename they wish to overwrite on the client machine, and then possibly
execute arbitrary code (for instance if the attacker elects to write a
dotfile in a home directory).

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.3-1+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your lftp packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-12 15:37:57 UTC  ``` The draft advisory from oCERT follows:  The lftp, wget and lwp-download applications are ftp/http clients and file transfer tools supporting various network protocols. The lwp-download script is shipped along with the libwww-perl library.  Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling the Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested filename' functionality.  Additionally unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and lwp-download in case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file dowloading. The two applications automatically use the URL's filename portion specified in the Location header.  Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file that differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by the user. This can be used by a malicious attacker to silently write hidden and/or initialization files under the user's current directory (e.g. .login, .bashrc).  The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of lftp/lftpget as the default configuration allows file overwrite without prompting confirmation to the user. In case of lftp the get1 command is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the user from lftp's command line interface or indirectly by using the lftpget script, packaged within lftp distribution.  Affected version:  lftp <= 4.0.5 wget <= 1.12 libwww-perl <= 5.834  Fixed version:  lftp >= 4.0.6 wget N/A libwww-perl >= 5.835  Credit:  Vulnerability discovered and reported by Hank Leininger and Solar Designer under the Openwall Project, with further analysis by Daniele Bianco of oCERT.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-15 12:53:15 UTC  ``` No patches from upstream are available on any of these, however lftp 4.0.6 does correct the issue, so we should be able to generate a patch based on a diff between 4.0.5 and 4.0.6.  The NEWS file indicates:  * use O_EXCL flag when xfer:clobber is off. * better validation of server-provided file name. * new setting xfer:auto-rename (off by default).  All three issues are relevant, but the last is the big one.  To test, try:  lftpget <http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz>  A vulnerable lftp will produce wordpress-2.9.2.tar.gz silently, whereas a fixed lftp will generate latest.tar.gz unless the user explicitly sets xfer:auto-rename.  This WordPress example is only useful when testing the Content-Disposition HTTP header, not Location.  libwww-perl 5.835 is also supposed to fix this issue, so a diff between 5.834 and 5.835 should produce a relevant patch.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c6)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-17 14:51:26 UTC  ``` This is now public:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2010-001.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-18 15:17:25 UTC  ``` Florian made a post to oss-security with a preliminary patch for wget.  It probably requires some upstream review as it does add a new configuration option:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2908>  However, Ludwig Nussel indicates that wget's behaviour is acceptable and probably doesn't require fixing at all, as wget does not overwrite existing files by default (adds suffixes like .1 and .2 to the new file if it already exists), and also prints the file name it used so there are no surprises.  In light of that, I would consider this a non-issue for wget, especially considering how intrusive the patch is for a backport.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c8)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-10 19:26:04 UTC  ``` MITRE has assigned the following CVE names for the three packages noted in this advisory, and as a result this bug has been cloned to distinguish between the three:  CVE-2010-2251: lftp CVE-2010-2252: wget (see [bug #602797](show_bug.cgi?id=602797 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2252 wget: multiple HTTP client download filename vulnerability [OCERT 2010-001]")) CVE-2010-2253: perl-libwww-perl (see [bug #602800](show_bug.cgi?id=602800 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2010-2253 perl-libwww-perl: multiple HTTP client download filename vulnerability [OCERT 2010-001]"))   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c9)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-10 20:12:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 423030](attachment.cgi?id=423030&action=diff "patch to correct the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=423030&action=edit "patch to correct the issue") patch to correct the issue  This patch is the relevant differences between 4.0.5 and 4.0.6, and also includes the following change from 4.0.7:  * GetJob.cc: make xfer:clobber=no by default.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c12)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-10 20:49:56 UTC  ``` Created lftp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 602836](show_bug.cgi?id=602836 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2251 lftp: multiple HTTP client download filename vulnerability [OCERT 2010-001] [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c14)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-11 12:25:50 UTC  ``` lftp-4.0.8-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/lftp-4.0.8-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c15)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-30 15:09:52 UTC  ``` lftp-4.0.8-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c16)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-24 15:18:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of lftp as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 as they did not include support for renaming files to a server-suggested file name.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c20)  Ondrej Vasik    2010-07-29 14:28:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 435311](attachment.cgi?id=435311&action=diff "Corrected patch with manpage changes") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=435311&action=edit "Corrected patch with manpage changes") Corrected patch with manpage changes  I added manpage corrections into the patch and changed it to respect xfer:clobber ... Old version of the patch had regression that it failed to rename the file if xfer:clobber was activated via conf file. This one works for me in all cases correctly.  As a side note - as lftp doesn't use temporary file, it still deletes the old file if it exists - as it downloads the file with the requested name and then it renames it to the servesuggested name.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-02 20:20:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0585 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0585.html>   ``` |  |
