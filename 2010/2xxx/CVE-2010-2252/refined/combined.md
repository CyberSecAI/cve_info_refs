Note: I had previous discussions with a Daniele Bianco at oCERT about
this. They were off-list, and they explicitly requested I not converse
about it publicly until a coordinated fix/announcement could be effected.

Nor by treating anything with an initial "dot" specially, I imagine. On
Windows, *.ini files probably provide a similar problem, and reliably
predicting which names are "dangerous" is a losing game.

Summary of my understanding: the problem results from wget's obedience
of filenames from redirects, which allows the remote end to arbitrarily
choose the filename of a single file. This presents the attack
opportunity you describe, but only in situations where wget is being
invoked to download a file directly into the home directory (which is a
bad idea without -O, but I'll grant you not everyone will realize that,
so it should probably be avoided there).

Similar situations can arise from running "wget --recursive
--no-directories" in the home directory. In this case, I don't think we
should work to avoid server-chosen names, since that's a fundamental
functionality change to wget, and in any case can't realistically be
done (I see your patch doesn't try). Instead, for this case we should
probably add something to the documentation for --no-directories warning
that you shouldn't use it if wget will be placing files directly in your
home directory or a similar sensitive location.

In conversations with Daniele, it sounded like you weren't concerned
about --content-disposition (whose entire purpose is to let the server
choose a name) because it has to be explicitly enabled. There had
previously been plans to make this the default, but it was disabled by
default because the current implementation can result in extra roundtrip
request/response with the server (it also always leaves them in the
download root, instead of in the "directory" containing the file, IIRC).
This makes a good case, even once those inefficiencies are resolved, for
leaving it as not the default.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Giuseppe, Micah, all -

As I hope you're aware, oCERT has published an advisory on a security
issue with lftp, wget, and libwww-perl.  lftp and libwww-perl have fixed
the issue.  wget didn't.

<http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2010-001.html>

Here's a demonstration of an attack on what I think is a typical wget
cron job:

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/05/18/13>

The attack provides a .wgetrc, which enables a second invocation of the
cron job to overwrite a file such as .bash_profile.  This is just one
example.  Please do not "fix" this by treating ".wgetrc" specially.

Here's an unofficial patch for the issue:

<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/05/17/2>

Now that we have a proof-of-concept real-world attack scenario and we
readily have a patch, would you possibly consider fixing this upstream?

Thanks,

Alexander

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-12 15:37:57 UTC  ``` The draft advisory from oCERT follows:  The lftp, wget and lwp-download applications are ftp/http clients and file transfer tools supporting various network protocols. The lwp-download script is shipped along with the libwww-perl library.  Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling the Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested filename' functionality.  Additionally unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and lwp-download in case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file dowloading. The two applications automatically use the URL's filename portion specified in the Location header.  Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file that differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by the user. This can be used by a malicious attacker to silently write hidden and/or initialization files under the user's current directory (e.g. .login, .bashrc).  The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of lftp/lftpget as the default configuration allows file overwrite without prompting confirmation to the user. In case of lftp the get1 command is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the user from lftp's command line interface or indirectly by using the lftpget script, packaged within lftp distribution.  Affected version:  lftp <= 4.0.5 wget <= 1.12 libwww-perl <= 5.834  Fixed version:  lftp >= 4.0.6 wget N/A libwww-perl >= 5.835  Credit:  Vulnerability discovered and reported by Hank Leininger and Solar Designer under the Openwall Project, with further analysis by Daniele Bianco of oCERT.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=591580#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-15 12:53:15 UTC  ``` No patches from upstream are available on any of these, however lftp 4.0.6 does correct the issue, so we should be able to generate a patch based on a diff between 4.0.5 and 4.0.6.  The NEWS file indicates:  * use O_EXCL flag when xfer:clobber is off. * better validation of server-provided file name. * new setting xfer:auto-rename (off by default).  All three issues are relevant, but the last is the big one.  To test, try:  lftpget <http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz>  A vulnerable lftp will produce wordpress-2.9.2.tar.gz silently, whereas a fixed lftp will generate latest.tar.gz unless the user explicitly sets xfer:auto-rename.

As far as I'm aware, at the time of the initial oCERT notification, the
wget upstream was represented by Micah Cowan, who was about to resign.
And he did:

<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2010-04/msg00027.html>

oCERT has re-notified the new upstream shortly before publishing the
advisory (we decided this was not enough of a reason to introduce a
further pre-public-disclosure delay).  I don't think the new wget
upstream has made a determination on this issue yet; at least I'm not
aware of that.

...

For those producing back-ports for lftp, the approach to take is to
download 4.0.5 and 4.0.6 from:

<http://ftp.yars.free.net/pub/source/lftp/old/>

Then diff them with:

diff -purx configure -x po -x 'Makefile*' -x '*.in' -x '*.in.h' -x m4 -x lib -x \
build-aux -x '*.m4' lftp-4.0.5 lftp-4.0.6

This is a small and relevant diff, which should be easy to manually turn
into a patch for just the relevant changes.  The NEWS file mentions these:

* use O_EXCL flag when xfer:clobber is off.
* better validation of server-provided file name.
* new setting xfer:auto-rename (off by default).

All three of the above are relevant, especially the last one.  A test
case is downloading WordPress with:

lftpget <http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz>

Vulnerable lftp will silently produce a file named like
wordpress-2.9.2.tar.gz instead of latest.tar.gz.  Fixed lftp will
produce latest.tar.gz unless the user explicitly sets xfer:auto-rename.

For Owl, we simply updated to lftp 4.0.7.  Our -stable branch uses a
too-old lftp (not yet vulnerable), so we did not require a back-port.

When testing tools other than lftp, please note that the WordPress test
case tests for one of two attack-usable HTTP headers only
(Content-Disposition but not Location).  We did test a handful of other
tools, but only three - lftp, lwp-download, wget - were found vulnerable.
curl, ELinks were found not vulnerable.  Lynx was inconclusive in Hank's
testing (and we did not investigate further).

Apologies to oCERT and everyone else for being so terrible at handling
this.

Hm... a problem with this is that it also applies to the case when
someone is recursively-fetching, and the remote server is (even
accidentally) misconfigured to include .htaccess in auto-generated
indexes (and to allow public reading of that file). No obvious way to
avoid that situation that I can think of... might be worth documenting
somewhere.

#2010-001 multiple http client unexpected download filename vulnerability

Description:

The lftp, wget and lwp-download applications are ftp/http clients and file
transfer tools supporting various network protocols. The lwp-download
script is shipped along with the libwww-perl library.

Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling the
Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested filename'
functionality.

Additionally, unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and lwp-download in
the case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file downloading. The two
applications automatically use the URL's filename portion specified in the
Location header.

Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file that
differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by the user.
This can be used by an attacker-controlled server to silently write hidden
and/or initialization files under the user's current directory
(e.g. .login, .bashrc).

The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of lftp/lftpget
as the default configuration allows file to be overwritten without
prompting the user for confirmation. In the case of lftp the get1 command
is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the user from lftp's
command line interface or indirectly by using the lftpget script, packaged
within the lftp distribution.

Affected version:

lftp <= 4.0.5

wget <= 1.12

libwww-perl <= 5.834

Fixed version:

lftp >= 4.0.6

wget N/A

libwww-perl >= 5.835

Credit: Vulnerability discovered and reported by Hank Leininger and Solar
        Designer under the Openwall Project, with further analysis by
        Daniele Bianco of oCERT.

wget doesn't overwrite existing files by default anyways. Instead it appends a
suffix .1, .2 etc to the newly downloaded file. wget also prints the file name
it used. So IMO it's perfectly fine and useful for wget to take the server
provided file name by default.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=602797#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-10 19:14:42 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #591580](show_bug.cgi?id=591580 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2251 lftp: multiple HTTP client download filename vulnerability [OCERT 2010-001]") +++  The draft advisory from oCERT follows:  The lftp, wget and lwp-download applications are ftp/http clients and file transfer tools supporting various network protocols. The lwp-download script is shipped along with the libwww-perl library.  Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling the Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested filename' functionality.  Additionally unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and lwp-download in case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file dowloading. The two applications automatically use the URL's filename portion specified in the Location header.  Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file that differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by the user. This can be used by a malicious attacker to silently write hidden and/or initialization files under the user's current directory (e.g. .login, .bashrc).  The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of lftp/lftpget as the default configuration allows file overwrite without prompting confirmation to the user. In case of lftp the get1 command is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the user from lftp's command line interface or indirectly by using the lftpget script, packaged within lftp distribution.  Affected version:  lftp <= 4.0.5 wget <= 1.12 libwww-perl <= 5.834  Fixed version:  lftp >= 4.0.6 wget N/A libwww-perl >= 5.835  Credit:  Vulnerability discovered and reported by Hank Leininger and Solar Designer under the Openwall Project, with further analysis by Daniele Bianco of oCERT.  --- Additional comment from vdanen on 2010-05-15 08:54:02 EDT ---  Florian noted the following as testcases for wget:  $ wget <http://www.postbank.de/-snm-0184304830-1273865547-04f6f00001-0000000023-1273866968-enm-privatkunden/fonds_boerse.htm> (adds ;jsessionied= to the stored file name)  There's yet another case, but that only results in an index.html download.  $ wget <http://www.enyo.de/fw>  --- Additional comment from vdanen on 2010-05-17 10:51:26 EDT ---  This is now public:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2010-001.html>  --- Additional comment from vdanen on 2010-05-18 11:17:25 EDT ---  Florian made a post to oss-security with a preliminary patch for wget.  It probably requires some upstream review as it does add a new configuration option:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2908>  However, Ludwig Nussel indicates that wget's behaviour is acceptable and probably doesn't require fixing at all, as wget does not overwrite existing files by default (adds suffixes like .1 and .2 to the new file if it already exists), and also prints the file name it used so there are no surprises.  In light of that, I would consider this a non-issue for wget, especially considering how intrusive the patch is for a backport.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=602797#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-10 19:18:58 UTC  ``` MITRE has assigned the name [CVE-2010-2252](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2252) to this issue.  Additional comments on oss-security from Solar Designer (<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/05/18/13>) indicate that this is something we should be looking at for wget:  I disagree.  Uses from scripts and cron jobs are too common, and they often don't care to specify an output filename explicitly.  Let's suppose there's a cron job like this:  1 * * * *       wget <http://www.openwall.com/pvt/wget/log> &> /dev/null  If the server is malicious or compromised, it can have:  RedirectMatch log $1/pvt/wget/.wgetrc  in .htaccess, and  reject=; exec id output-document=.bash_profile  in .wgetrc.  When the cron job runs for the first time after the above changes made on the server, it does:  02:01:02 (2.64 MB/s) - `.wgetrc' saved [47/47]  At this point, .wgetrc is on the client system.  The second time the cron job runs, it does:  03:01:02 (2.99 MB/s) - `.bash_profile' saved [47/47]  This has happily overwritten my .bash_profile file.  (I replaced "/dev/null" in the cron job with another filename for obtaining these wget output lines.)  When I am logging in to the affected account, I get the output of "id". Of course, the shell command could as well be nastier than that.  Although I used a somewhat tricky approach in the above exploit, eventually making wget overwrite a file, it is also possible to mount attacks that do not rely on overwriting any files.  Many programs support optional startup/config files of fixed/known/guessable names that a malicious or compromised server could provide.  In fact, I've just demonstrated this attack against wget itself, but it could also work against another program.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=602797#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-21 22:12:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 425763](attachment.cgi?id=425763&action=diff "patch to correct the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=425763&action=edit "patch to correct the issue") patch to correct the issue  This patch is based on Florian's patch posted on oss-security: <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2908> and works on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=602797#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-22 16:55:52 UTC  ``` On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 (wget 1.10.2), the first issue (the appended jsessionied) is not seen, but the malicious server redirect is a problem.

Serving dot files is a neat trick indeed, I've overlooked that
paragraph in the ocert advisory. Nevertheless I'm not convinced it's
worth changing wget's default behavior in the proposed way. So I can
understand upstream here.

Micah, the previous wget maintainer who is still active on the bug-wget
list, has commented on the issue:

<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2010-05/msg00031.html>
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2010-05/msg00033.html>

It sounds like he does not mind a fix like Florian's patch getting
included upstream.  We'll see what the current maintainers say.

In another bug-wget posting, I described an attack that does not involve
a Unix user's home directory and a dot-file:

<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-wget/2010-05/msg00032.html>

It works against wget of a file into a website "document root" tree and
it may take advantage of index.html taking precedence over index.php.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=602797#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-10 19:14:42 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #591580](show_bug.cgi?id=591580 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-2251 lftp: multiple HTTP client download filename vulnerability [OCERT 2010-001]") +++  The draft advisory from oCERT follows:  The lftp, wget and lwp-download applications are ftp/http clients and file transfer tools supporting various network protocols. The lwp-download script is shipped along with the libwww-perl library.  Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling the Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested filename' functionality.  Additionally unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and lwp-download in case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file dowloading. The two applications automatically use the URL's filename portion specified in the Location header.  Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file that differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by the user. This can be used by a malicious attacker to silently write hidden and/or initialization files under the user's current directory (e.g. .login, .bashrc).  The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of lftp/lftpget as the default configuration allows file overwrite without prompting confirmation to the user. In case of lftp the get1 command is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the user from lftp's command line interface or indirectly by using the lftpget script, packaged within lftp distribution.  Affected version:  lftp <= 4.0.5 wget <= 1.12 libwww-perl <= 5.834  Fixed version:  lftp >= 4.0.6 wget N/A libwww-perl >= 5.835  Credit:  Vulnerability discovered and reported by Hank Leininger and Solar Designer under the Openwall Project, with further analysis by Daniele Bianco of oCERT.  --- Additional comment from vdanen on 2010-05-15 08:54:02 EDT ---  Florian noted the following as testcases for wget:  $ wget <http://www.postbank.de/-snm-0184304830-1273865547-04f6f00001-0000000023-1273866968-enm-privatkunden/fonds_boerse.htm> (adds ;jsessionied= to the stored file name)  There's yet another case, but that only results in an index.html download.  $ wget <http://www.enyo.de/fw>  --- Additional comment from vdanen on 2010-05-17 10:51:26 EDT ---  This is now public:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2010-001.html>  --- Additional comment from vdanen on 2010-05-18 11:17:25 EDT ---  Florian made a post to oss-security with a preliminary patch for wget.  It probably requires some upstream review as it does add a new configuration option:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2908>  However, Ludwig Nussel indicates that wget's behaviour is acceptable and probably doesn't require fixing at all, as wget does not overwrite existing files by default (adds suffixes like .1 and .2 to the new file if it already exists), and also prints the file name it used so there are no surprises.  In light of that, I would consider this a non-issue for wget, especially considering how intrusive the patch is for a backport.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=602797#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-10 19:18:58 UTC  ``` MITRE has assigned the name [CVE-2010-2252](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2252) to this issue.  Additional comments on oss-security from Solar Designer (<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/05/18/13>) indicate that this is something we should be looking at for wget:  I disagree.  Uses from scripts and cron jobs are too common, and they often don't care to specify an output filename explicitly.  Let's suppose there's a cron job like this:  1 * * * *       wget <http://www.openwall.com/pvt/wget/log> &> /dev/null  If the server is malicious or compromised, it can have:  RedirectMatch log $1/pvt/wget/.wgetrc  in .htaccess, and  reject=; exec id output-document=.bash_profile  in .wgetrc.  When the cron job runs for the first time after the above changes made on the server, it does:  02:01:02 (2.64 MB/s) - `.wgetrc' saved [47/47]  At this point, .wgetrc is on the client system.  The second time the cron job runs, it does:  03:01:02 (2.99 MB/s) - `.bash_profile' saved [47/47]  This has happily overwritten my .bash_profile file.  (I replaced "/dev/null" in the cron job with another filename for obtaining these wget output lines.)  When I am logging in to the affected account, I get the output of "id". Of course, the shell command could as well be nastier than that.  Although I used a somewhat tricky approach in the above exploit, eventually making wget overwrite a file, it is also possible to mount attacks that do not rely on overwriting any files.  Many programs support optional startup/config files of fixed/known/guessable names that a malicious or compromised server could provide.  In fact, I've just demonstrated this attack against wget itself, but it could also work against another program.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=602797#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-21 22:12:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 425763](attachment.cgi?id=425763&action=diff "patch to correct the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=425763&action=edit "patch to correct the issue") patch to correct the issue  This patch is based on Florian's patch posted on oss-security: <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2908> and works on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=602797#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-22 16:55:52 UTC  ``` On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 (wget 1.10.2), the first issue (the appended jsessionied) is not seen, but the malicious server redirect is a problem.

## Synopsis

Low: wget security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0151)

## Topic

An updated wget package that fixes one security issue and one bug is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The wget package provides the GNU Wget file retrieval utility for HTTP,
HTTPS, and FTP protocols. Wget provides various useful features, such as
the ability to work in the background while the user is logged out,
recursive retrieval of directories, file name wildcard matching or updating
files in dependency on file timestamp comparison.

It was discovered that wget used a file name provided by the server when
saving a downloaded file. This could cause wget to create a file with a
different name than expected, possibly allowing the server to execute
arbitrary code on the client. (CVE-2010-2252)

Note: With this update, wget always uses the last component of the original
URL as the name for the downloaded file. Previous behavior of using the
server provided name or the last component of the redirected URL when
creating files can be re-enabled by using the '--trust-server-names'
command line option, or by setting 'trust\_server\_names=on' in the wget
start-up file.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the wget package did not recognize HTTPS SSL

certificates with alternative names (subjectAltName) specified in the
certificate as valid. As a consequence, running the wget command failed
with a certificate error. This update fixes wget to recognize such
certificates as valid. (BZ#1060113)

All users of wget are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=833831#c0)  Petr Šplíchal    2012-06-20 12:54:24 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When wget fetches a page which is redirected to another page it uses the redirected page name for file creation which could be something user is not expecting and could probably present a security issue. This is correctly fixed in latest wget in RHEL7.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): wget-1.12-1.4.el6.x86_64  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set up some redirection on the server 2. wget the redirected page    Actual results:  For example: wget --max-redirect=40 <http://localhost/wget/redir/00.html>  --2012-06-20 16:39:28--  <http://localhost/wget/redir/00.html> Resolving localhost... ::1, 127.0.0.1 Connecting to localhost|::1|:80... connected.

Micah,

Thank you for your detailed analysis and reply.

That's correct.  Now that the oCERT advisory has been published, we can
and should discuss in public.  oCERT did not wait for wget to be fixed
in part because you indicated you did not intend to fix the issue,
as well as because the pre-disclosure delay was already excessive for
this issue (way beyond what oCERT's policy says...) and because the lftp
fix was made public (without coordination with oCERT... who only learned
of that with a 1-month delay).  The lftp fix did not mention/explain the
security relevance of the changes, though.

Exactly.

That's correct, except for the "only ... into the home directory" part.
In practice, this restriction may apply most of the time, but there are
scenarios where a download into another directory could also allow for
an attack.  For example, a cron job on a web hosting account may use
wget to update a file below the "document root".  An attack would be to
provide an .htaccess file instead.  Another attack would be to provide
an index.html file, assuming that it did not exist - say, index.php
existed, but index.html would commonly take precedence.  Thus, a stock
quotes feed (or whatever), when compromised, would deface the homepage.
Without the wget issue, only a web page actually displaying the content
obtained from the remote would be affected.

I agree.  (The patch is Florian's, not mine, but it looks good to me.)

Yes, this fully matches my understanding.

I did not previously know your non-security reasons for having
--content-disposition disabled by default.  Thank you for explaining
that.  Now we also have a security reason for keeping that default.

Thanks again,

Alexander

Thanks.  In another venue, I wrote:

Here's a sequence of patches implementing this approach, against
1.11.4.  Testing with valgrind revealed a use-after-free bug
(harmless, I guess) in http_atotm().  Copying the fix in wget 1.12
revealed an unterminated string (also harmless), which I fixed as
well.

The resulting wget has received light testing.  File name generation
is quite different, especially in recursive mode, but that is the
point of this change.

  ********************************************************

I'm not really happy with the option name and welcome better
suggestions, but if it ends up in running code, we can't replace it
with something better anymore.  (And I'm not happy to diverge from
upstream in this manner, but that's just life, I guess.)

**oCERT-2010-001 multiple http client unexpected download filename**

**Description**:

The [lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru), [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget)
and [lwp-download](http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl/bin/lwp-download)
applications are FTP/HTTP clients and file transfer tools supporting
various network protocols. The lwp-download script is shipped along
with the [libwww-perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl)
library.

Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling
the Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested
filename' functionality.

Additionally, unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and
lwp-download in the case of HTTP 3xx redirections during file
downloading. The two applications automatically use the URL's filename
portion specified in the Location header.

Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file
that differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by
the user. This can be used by an attacker-controlled server to silently
write hidden and/or initialization files under the user's current
directory (e.g. .login, .bashrc).

The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of
lftp/lftpget as the default configuration allows file to be overwritten
without prompting the user for confirmation. In the case of lftp the
get1 command is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the
user from lftp's command line interface or indirectly by using the
lftpget script, packaged within the lftp distribution.

**Affected version**:

[lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru) <= 4.0.5

[wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget) <= 1.12

[libwww-perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl) <= 5.834

**Fixed version**:

[lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru) >= 4.0.6

[wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget) N/A

[libwww-perl](http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl) >= 5.835

**Credit**: vulnerability discovered and reported by Hank
Leininger and Solar Designer under the Openwall Project, with further
analysis by Daniele Bianco of oCERT.

**CVE**: [CVE-2010-2251](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2251) (lftp), [CVE-2010-2252](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2252) (wget), [CVE-2010-2253](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2253) (libwww-perl)

Well, a server can sometimes override that default - please see below.

This is of limited help - and for interactive uses only.  I am mostly
concerned about uses from cron jobs and the like.

I disagree.  Uses from scripts and cron jobs are too common, and they
often don't care to specify an output filename explicitly.

Let's suppose there's a cron job like this:

1 * * * *	wget <http://www.openwall.com/pvt/wget/log> &> /dev/null

If the server is malicious or compromised, it can have:

RedirectMatch log $1/pvt/wget/.wgetrc

in .htaccess, and

reject=; exec id
output-document=.bash_profile

in .wgetrc.  When the cron job runs for the first time after the above
changes made on the server, it does:

02:01:02 (2.64 MB/s) - `.wgetrc' saved [47/47]

At this point, .wgetrc is on the client system.  The second time the
cron job runs, it does:

03:01:02 (2.99 MB/s) - `.bash_profile' saved [47/47]

This has happily overwritten my .bash_profile file.

(I replaced "/dev/null" in the cron job with another filename for
obtaining these wget output lines.)

When I am logging in to the affected account, I get the output of "id".
Of course, the shell command could as well be nastier than that.

Although I used a somewhat tricky approach in the above exploit,
eventually making wget overwrite a file, it is also possible to mount
attacks that do not rely on overwriting any files.  Many programs
support optional startup/config files of fixed/known/guessable names
that a malicious or compromised server could provide.  In fact, I've
just demonstrated this attack against wget itself, but it could also
work against another program.

Is this more convincing now?

Yes, the recursive-fetching risks probably need to be addressed in the
documentation only, not in the code.  I think they're also more likely
to be expected by the users.
