  "Root cause of vulnerability": "wget uses the file name provided by the server when saving a downloaded file, which can be controlled via HTTP redirects or the Content-Disposition header.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from wget's automatic use of the filename portion specified in the Location header during HTTP 3xx redirections or the filename suggested in the Content-Disposition header. This allows a malicious server to dictate the filename under which wget stores the downloaded content.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious server can cause wget to save files with unexpected names, including hidden files (e.g., .wgetrc, .bashrc, .htaccess) or other configuration files. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities when these files are later used by the system or other applications. An attacker can also overwrite existing files, potentially altering system behavior or defacing web pages.",
  "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through a malicious or compromised server that can control HTTP redirects or the Content-Disposition header. When wget attempts to download a file, the server can respond with a redirection (HTTP 3xx) to a different URL, or provide a Content-Disposition header suggesting a malicious filename. If wget is used in scripts or cron jobs without specifying an output filename, it is particularly susceptible to this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a server that wget is attempting to download from. They must be able to manipulate the server's HTTP responses to include malicious redirects or Content-Disposition headers. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, only have the ability to manipulate the target URL."
