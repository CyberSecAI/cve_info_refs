Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within the `theme.add_msg` function of the MoinMoin wiki software. The `template` parameter was not properly escaped before being used in the message displayed to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. Malicious scripts injected through the `template` parameter are directly included in the HTML output of the page, allowing the script to execute within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session identifiers (cookies) from users who click on the malicious link.
- **Browser Exploitation:** Attackers could leverage the XSS to execute other exploits that target browser vulnerabilities, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Malicious Actions:** The injected script could be used to perform various malicious actions on behalf of the victim user, such as defacing the page or redirecting them to a phishing site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes the malicious script in the `template` parameter. For example:
  ```
  http://<site>/NonExistantUser?action=edit&template=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
  ```
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on this crafted URL, likely through social engineering techniques (e.g., embedding the link in an email or a message).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create and distribute malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create and share the crafted URL containing the malicious script.
- **Social engineering skills:** The attacker needs the ability to persuade users to click the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in MoinMoin versions 1.7.x, 1.8.x, and 1.9.x.
- The fix involves escaping the input from the `template` parameter before it's used in the `add_msg` function. Specifically, the `wikiutil.escape()` function was added to sanitize the `template` parameter in `MoinMoin/PageEditor.py`.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2010-2487.
- Patches were made available for the affected versions.
