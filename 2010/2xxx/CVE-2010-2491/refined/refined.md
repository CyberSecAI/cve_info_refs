Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-2491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user input when processing `PageTemplate` templates in the Roundup issue-tracking system. Specifically, the `template` argument in the `/issue` program was not being escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into a web page viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:**  By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of a victim's browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions like:
    - Stealing cookies.
    - Making arbitrary changes to the Roundup interface or data.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the vulnerable `template` argument with injected JavaScript or HTML.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting this specially crafted URL. This could involve sending the link via email, chat, or embedding it on another website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need direct access to the server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `template` parameter and how to exploit it.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to socially engineer a legitimate user to click on the malicious link.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability is present in Roundup versions prior to 1.4.14.
- The fix involves escaping user input when handling template names.
- The issue was reported and fixed quickly within the Roundup project.
-  The vulnerability affects users who are logged into a Roundup instance.
- Example URLs demonstrating the vulnerability are provided in the issue tracker data.
- The vulnerability was present in multiple distributions of Linux that used the Roundup issue tracker.
