{
  "CVE-2010-2891": {
    "Description": "Buffer overflow in the smiGetNode function in lib/smi.c in libsmi 0.4.8 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via an Object Identifier (aka OID) represented as a numerical string containing many components separated by . (dot) characters.",
    "Root cause": "The `smiGetNode` function in `lib/smi.c` uses a statically allocated buffer (`oid[128]`) to store the OID in numerical format. When parsing a numerical OID string, it uses `strtok` to split the string by dots and `strtoul` to convert the parts to integers, storing them into the buffer. However, the code does not check if the OID has more than 128 components, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow (CWE-119)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution by overwriting key pointers in memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "A context-dependent attacker can trigger the vulnerability by supplying a long Object Identifier (OID) represented as a numerical string with many components separated by dots to the vulnerable smiGetNode function.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a long OID string to the vulnerable function, often through a user interface that allows input of OID strings, however the specific context is dependent on the application that is using the libSMI library. The SNMP packets that travel over the network typically do not use the dotted decimal notation for OIDs, limiting the risk from network attacks"
