## Synopsis

Moderate: vdsm22 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0628)

## Topic

Updated vdsm22 packages that fix one security issue and multiple bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

VDSM is a management module that serves as a Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager agent on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor or Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts.

Note: This update has been tested and is supported on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5.5 (with all appropriate post-GA 5.5-specific updates).

A flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker
could trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,
preventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.
(CVE-2010-2811)

These updated vdsm22 packages also fix the following bugs:

* suspend-to-file hibernation failed for huge guests due to the migration

and hibernation constant values being too short for huge guests. This
update makes the timeouts proportional to guest RAM size, thus allowing
suspension of huge guests in all cases except where storage is unbearably
slow. (BZ#601275)

* under certain circumstances, restarting a VDSM that was being used as a

Storage Pool Manager killed all system processes on the host. With this
update, stopping VDSM is ensured to kill only the processes that it
started, and the VDSM SIGTERM handler is not run concurrently. With these
changes, all processes on the host are no longer killed when VDSM is
restarted. (BZ#614849)

* when VDSM was requested to "start in paused mode", it incorrectly

reported virtual guest state as "WaitForLaunch" instead of "Paused", which
led to the virtual guest being inaccessible from Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager. With this update, VDSM reports such virtual guests
as "Paused", and users are able to connect to the virtual guest display.
(BZ#616464)

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 2.2 users with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux hosts should install these updated packages, which resolve these
issues. Alternatively, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager can
install the new package automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

RHSA-2010:0622 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2010-08-19
Updated:
2010-08-19
# RHSA-2010:0622 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated rhev-hypervisor packages that fix multiple security issues and two
bugs are now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not
validate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card
driver. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to
dereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of
service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating
their privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be
forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses
controlled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on
the host. (CVE-2010-0429)

It was found that QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers
provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver. A privileged guest
user could use this flaw to cause the host to dereference an invalid
pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly,
resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-0431)

A flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the
index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO
initialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the
guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-2784)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found when Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor was run on a system that has a processor with the
Intel VT-x extension enabled. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
to trick the host into emulating a certain instruction, which could crash
the host (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0435)

A flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker
could trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,
preventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.
(CVE-2010-2811)

These updated packages provide updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for avahi issues
CVE-2009-0758 and CVE-2010-2244; freetype issues CVE-2010-1797,
CVE-2010-2498, CVE-2010-2499, CVE-2010-2500, CVE-2010-2519, CVE-2010-2527,
and CVE-2010-2541; kernel issues CVE-2010-1084, CVE-2010-2066,
CVE-2010-2070, CVE-2010-2226, CVE-2010-2248, CVE-2010-2521, and
CVE-2010-2524; and openldap issues CVE-2010-0211 and CVE-2010-0212.

These updated rhev-hypervisor packages also fix two bugs. Documentation for
these bug fixes will be available shortly from
<http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
fixes from the KVM update RHSA-2010:0627 have been included in this update.
Also included are the bug fixes from the VDSM update RHSA-2010:0628.

KVM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html> VDSM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0628.html>

Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to these updated rhev-hypervisor packages, which resolve these
issues.
