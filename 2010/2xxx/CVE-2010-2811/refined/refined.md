Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how VDSM (Virtual Desktop Server Manager) accepts SSL connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A flaw exists in the VDSM's SSL connection handling mechanism.
- Specifically, the `accept()` call on a non-blocking connection is affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted SSL connection.
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, preventing VDSM from accepting further SSL connections from legitimate users. This effectively stops the VDSM from functioning.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can trigger this vulnerability over a network.
- It requires the attacker to establish an SSL connection to the vulnerable VDSM service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to establish a network connection to the VDSM service.
- The attacker needs the capability to craft a specific type of SSL connection that triggers the vulnerability.
