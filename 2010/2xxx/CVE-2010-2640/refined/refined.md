      "source": "www.ubuntu.com_f7e1ff69_20250124_222810.html",
       "root_cause": "Evince's font parsers incorrectly handled certain buffer lengths when rendering a DVI file.",

        "Insufficient array bounds checks"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could crash evince or execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "By tricking a user into opening or previewing a DVI file that uses a specially crafted font file.",

      "source": "bugzilla.redhat.com_938ae53b_20250124_222812.html",
       "root_cause": "An array index error in the parser for PK font files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient bounds checks when writing to elements in an array"
      ],
       "impact": "Overwrite the address of a function pointer, leading to possible arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered not only by opening the document in evince, but also by browsing to a folder which contains the malicious files, where evince thumbnailer will load the malicious file to generate a thumbnail for it.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious DVI file with a specially crafted font file, and trick the user to open the file or browse a directory containing the file."
