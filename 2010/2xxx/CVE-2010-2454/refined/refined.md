Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles navigation events, specifically when a new window or tab is opened via `window.open()`. The browser prematurely updates the address bar with the URL of the new resource being loaded before the load is fully complete. If the server responds with an HTTP 204 ("No Content") response or if the script calls `window.stop()` before the content is loaded, the address bar displays the intended URL while the actual content is either a blank page, or the old page content. This creates a spoofing vulnerability as the user sees the target URL while being presented with different content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Address Bar Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to display a false URL in the address bar while loading a different page or preventing the load, making it appear as if the user is on a different site than they actually are.
- **Premature URL Display:** Firefox updates the address bar with the new URL before fully verifying the successful load of that resource.
- **Inconsistent Handling of 204 Responses:** The browser did not correctly handle HTTP 204 responses, leading to the address bar showing one URL while the content from the previous page remained.
- **`window.stop()` Abuse:** The ability to use `window.stop()` to halt loading after setting the address bar also contributed to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing:** Attackers could use this vulnerability to create convincing phishing pages that appear to be legitimate websites.
- **Deception:** Users could be tricked into believing they are interacting with a trusted source, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or installation of malware.
- **General Confusion:** The discrepancy between the displayed URL and the actual content could cause user confusion and make them vulnerable to other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **JavaScript:** The attack is executed using JavaScript to open a new window via `window.open()`.
- **HTTP 204 Responses:** The attacker can leverage a server that responds with a 204 No Content status code to trigger the vulnerability.
- **`window.stop()`:** By calling `window.stop()` in JavaScript after the URL has been set, the attacker can cause the address bar to show the target URL while presenting different content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript on a page viewed by the victim. This could be achieved through a malicious website or by injecting script into a vulnerable site.
- **Server Control (for 204 exploit):** If using the 204 response vector, the attacker needs to control or have access to a server that can respond with HTTP 204 responses.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug report shows that multiple scenarios were tested, and the fix was implemented to address the root cause by ensuring the address bar is only updated after a successful load.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 3.6.6, and later backported into the 3.5 branch.
- Several iterations of patches were created before the final fix was implemented. The patch involved preventing the URL bar from updating prematurely and correctly handling failed loads.
