Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-2073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from hardcoded usernames and passwords within the `/etc/pyftpd/auth_db_config.py` file in Pyftpd version 0.8.4. This file includes credentials for "test," "user," and "roxon" accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of default, hardcoded usernames and passwords.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The default configuration ships with active user accounts and their passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can use the hardcoded credentials to log in to the FTP server. This access allows them to read any file on the system accessible by the FTP server process.
- **Directory Listing:** Attackers can also list directories on the system, further exposing the file system.
- **Full server compromise:** While not explicitly stated, arbitrary file access and directory listing might lead to full server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is network access to the vulnerable FTP server.
- **FTP Protocol:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by attempting to login to the FTP server using the exposed credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable FTP server.
- **Basic FTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to connect and authenticate to an FTP server.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker doesn't need any credentials besides those present in the default configuration file.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue is fixed in pyftpd versions 0.8.5 and 0.8.4.6+lenny1 by removing the default users.
- The `perm_acl_config.py` file controls user permissions which are also exposed by exploiting this vulnerability.
