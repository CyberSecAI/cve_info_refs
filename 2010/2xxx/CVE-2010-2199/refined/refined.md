The provided content is related to CVE-2005-4889, not CVE-2010-2199.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- When updating a package, the rpm package manager does not remove the setuid/setgid bits from existing hardlinks to the updated executable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to remove setuid/setgid bits on hardlinked files during package updates.
- This allows an attacker to maintain access via a hardlink to a vulnerable (setuid/setgid) executable even after it has been "updated".

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If a malicious user creates a hardlink to a vulnerable setuid/setgid program, they can retain those elevated privileges even after the program has been updated with a fix if the update does not remove the bits from the hardlinked copies.
- This allows for privilege escalation and continued system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor creates a hard link to a vulnerable setuid/setgid program.
- The vulnerable program is updated.
- The hard link retains its setuid/setgid bits, allowing the malicious actor to retain the ability to gain elevated privileges by executing the hardlinked copy of the program.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create hardlinks to existing files on the system.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of a vulnerable program that has the setuid or setgid bits set.
