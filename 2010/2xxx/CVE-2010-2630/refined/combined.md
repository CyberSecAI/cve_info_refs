# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF 4.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.2-r1"

```

All libTIFF 3.9 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.9.5-r2"

```

I'm moving this bug to the libtiff component.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c4)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-11 18:51:43 UTC  ``` The testcase doesn't crash libtiff on RHEL5. I wonder if upstream missed a fix.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c5)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-11 19:33:18 UTC  ``` This appears to be a crash only.  libtiff is calling:  _TIFFsetString(&sp->faxdcs, va_arg(ap, char*));  But the arg ap is a integer, so it gets confused and we end up with a bad char* pointer.  I'm happy to call this not security. Tom any thoughts?  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c6)  Tom Lane    2010-01-11 19:33:42 UTC  ``` It's hard to see how it could fail to crash.  The root of the problem seems to be that the file contains a LONG (ie, integral) value for tag 34911 (FAXDCS) while the library is expecting a string.  There is code in TIFFReadDirectory that checks for a type mismatch, but *it only works for tag numbers that are known to the core libtiff code*.  In this case the tag is a codec-specific one, so it can't be checked by the core code, and the API for codecs appears to be misdesigned so that it's impossible for the codec to protect itself against this :-(.  I think we're going to have to punt this one upstream; it's not apparent to me what a reasonable fix would look like.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c7)  Tom Lane    2010-01-11 19:35:33 UTC  ``` I dunno about calling it not-security.  It certainly looks like crashing the library is trivial; I'm not sure whether there is scope for anything nastier.  OTOH libtiff has a sufficiently bad track record that I hope nobody is using it in security-vulnerable situations anyway :-(   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c9)  Tom Lane    2010-06-12 20:29:57 UTC  ``` Filed upstream at <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2210>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c10)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:27 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c11)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:14:47 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c12)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-23 04:15:03 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtiff-3.9.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=554371#c13)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-24 16:29:47 UTC  ``` libtiff-3.8.2-15.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

The reason is apparent after inspecting tiffdump output:  Magic: 0x4949 <little-endian> Version: 0x2a Directory 0: offset 90 (0x5a) next 0 (0) 34911 (0x885f) LONG (4) 1<0> ImageWidth (256) SHORT (3) 1<5> ImageLength (257) SHORT (3) 1<5> BitsPerSample (258) SHORT (3) 3<8 8 8> Compression (259) SHORT (3) 1<7> ... etc etc ...  Tag 34911 is FAXDCS, which should be a string; because what's actually in the file isn't a string, a crash occurs when JPEGVSetField tries to process it.  I thought for a long time that this represented a design error in the API for VSetField functions, but actually the problem is more localized: TIFFReadDirectory is simply failing to apply the correct data type check to the FAXDCS field, because it appears out-of-order.  I am not sure if libtiff 4.0 has a related problem ... has the notion of run-time registration of fields been removed entirely?  If not, you might need to fix it too. ```  ------- *Comment [#1](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c1) From Tom Lane  2010-06-12 15:26:42* ------- ``` [Created an attachment (id=393)](attachment.cgi?id=393 "proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=393&action=edit "proposed patch") proposed patch  Here is my proposed fix.  This works by moving processing of unknown tags into an extra pass in TIFFReadDirectory.  I had first thought we could fix it by just adding a datatype check to the existing second pass, but that fails because the first pass makes anonymous field entries for unknown tags. That actually prevents the codec from installing the correct field data, so the datatype check still succeeds :-(.  So we must not install anonymous-field entries until after the codec gets registered, and a separate pass seems like the cleanest way to do it. ```  ------- *Comment [#2](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c2) From Frank Warmerdam  2010-06-13 19:22:10* ------- ``` Patch applied as proposed in 3.9 branch.   Thanks ```  ------- *Comment [#3](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c3) From Tom Lane  2010-06-14 10:30:34* ------- ``` BTW, this patch turns out to also fix another problem: in the original coding, if fix >= tif->tif_nfields at the top of the first pass, it would just ignore the tag.  If the tag was unknown, that leads to crash in the second pass, which expects every tag to have an entry in the field array.  There is at least one code path that can lead to that situation (as exposed by another test file just submitted to Red Hat :-()). ```  ------- *Comment [#4](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c4) From Tom Lane  2010-06-16 00:39:12* ------- ``` [Created an attachment (id=396)](attachment.cgi?id=396 "incremental patch to un-break out-of-order warning") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=396&action=edit "incremental patch to un-break out-of-order warning") incremental patch to un-break out-of-order warning  Ooops ... that patch has a problem, which is that it sometimes will emit the "tags are not sorted in ascending order" warning when there isn't any such error.  The logic for doing that was more closely coupled to the tag search lookup code than I realized ... and I was mostly testing with bogus files that had that sort of problem, so I didn't realize it was complaining too much.  The cleanest fix seems to be to decouple those two activities completely, at the cost of one extra variable.  See patch. ```  ------- *Comment [#5](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c5) From Tom Lane  2010-06-16 00:39:54* ------- ``` Reopened, needs additional patch.  Sorry 'bout that. ```  ------- *Comment [#6](show_bug.cgi?id=2210#c6) From Lee Howard  2010-12-13 21:42:50* ------- ``` I've applied the incremental patch to 3.9 CVS.  The patch does not apply at all to HEAD.  Thanks. ``` |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
