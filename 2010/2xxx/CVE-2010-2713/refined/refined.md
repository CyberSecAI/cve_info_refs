  "CVE-2010-2713": {
    "Description": "Applications using VTE, such as gnome-terminal, did not correctly filter window and icon title request escape codes. If a user were tricked into viewing specially crafted output in their terminal, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands with user privileges.",
    "Root cause": "Improper filtering of window and icon title request escape codes within the VTE library.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of terminal escape sequences.",
      "Lack of sufficient sanitization of control characters."
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary command execution with user privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": [
          "Specially crafted terminal output containing malicious escape codes."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to display the malicious terminal output to the victim.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was fixed by reverting to static replies for title queries, as opposed to processing and responding to dynamic requests.  This fix was made available in VTE version 0.19.4. Red Hat bugzilla entry notes that it was fixed upstream. Ubuntu security notice indicates fix was for Ubuntu 9.04, 9.10 and 10.04. OpenSUSE also lists this CVE as fixed in their security summary report"
