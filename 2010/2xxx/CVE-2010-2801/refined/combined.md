Hi Steve, vendors,

   two security issues have been reported against cabextract:

1, Infinite loop in MS-ZIP and Quantum decoders (minor issue):

A deficiency has been reported in the way cabextract extracted
certain Cabinet (*.cab) files, using the MZ-ZIP and Quantum decompressors.
If a local user was tricked into opening a specially-crafted *.cab
file, it could lead to infinite loop.

References:
   [[1]](#1) <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329891>

Upstream patches:
   [[2]](#2) <http://libmspack.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libmspack?view=revision&revision=90>
   [[3]](#3) <http://libmspack.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libmspack?view=revision&revision=95>
   [[4]](#4) <http://libmspack.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libmspack/libmspack/trunk/mspack/>

2, Integer wrap-around (crash) by processing certain *.cab files in test archive mode

An integer wrap-around flaw has been reported in the way cabextract processed
certain Cabinet (*.cab) archive files. If a local user was tricked into opening
a specially-crafted *.cab archive in test archive mode, it could lead to cabextract
executable crash.

Could you allocate CVE ids for these?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2087-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : cabextract
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-2801

It was discovered that a programming error in the archive test mode of
cabextract, a program to extract Microsoft Cabinet files, could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2-3+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your cabextract package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

| [Description](#c0)  Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-07-26 10:49:31 UTC  ``` <http://www.cabextract.org.uk/cabextract-1.3.tar.gz> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-07-30 10:20:49 UTC  ``` cabextract 1.3 fixes several bugs in cabextract 1.2, including fixing two security bugs.  The two security bugs are as follows:  Bug 1: Infinite loop in MS-ZIP decoder  The MS-ZIP and Quantum decoders read bits in roughly the same way as the LZX decoder, however they don't have "inject two fake bytes" code.  In the situation where read() provides zero bytes, e.g. at the end of file or end of a CAB block, the LZX decoder handles this by injecting two fake bytes, then returns an error on subsequent calls. MS-ZIP and Quantum instead return zero bytes without error. However, all three decoders are written to presume they will get at least one byte. So this could lead to an infinite loop in MS-ZIP and Quantum. An infinite loop has definitely been seen in MS-ZIP - there is a while loop in inflate() of an uncompressed block (block type 0) which won't end until enough input is provided.  Partial solution: change "if (read < 0)" to "if (read <= 0)" in mszipd.c and qtmd.c. - <http://libmspack.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libmspack?view=revision&revision=90>  However, this breaks compatibility with a number of MS-ZIP/Quantum encoded files. A full solution would be to implement the same bit-reading system as LZX. I've done this now, merging all the bit-reading and huffman-reading code into two new files; readbits.h and readhuff.h - <http://libmspack.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libmspack?view=revision&revision=95>  There are several further changes made to integrate readbits.h and readhuff.h, I recommend you look at the latest version in the source repository. - <http://libmspack.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libmspack/libmspack/trunk/mspack/>  [Bug 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2 "RESOLVED FIXED - How do I attach an ebuild."): Segmentation fault in "cabextract -t"  This bug may not affect you, depending on your implementation of mspack_system->write(). It does cause a segfault in cabextract's cabx_write() in "-t" (test archive) mode.  In the Quantum decoder, when the window wrap is reached, all currently unwritten data is flushed to disk. Sometimes, less data is needed than is flushed, which makes the variable out_bytes negative.  When the main decoding loop finishes, a final call to write() is made if out_bytes is not zero. In that situation, it calls mspack_system->write() with a negative byte count, e.g. -129 bytes. You should reject this. In cabextract's "-t" mode, this is not caught, but instead converted to an unsigned integer and passed to md5_process_bytes(), which tries to read e.g. 4294967167 bytes, causing it to read beyond the end of valid process space and thus segfault.  Solution: - Break out to the end of the decoding loop immediately if the flush would be more than needed.    <http://libmspack.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libmspack/libmspack/trunk/mspack/qtmd.c?r1=114&r2=113> - Add checking of the "bytes" argument in mspack_system read() / write() implementations, just to be sure.    <http://libmspack.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libmspack?view=revision&revision=118> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-07-30 10:24:28 UTC  ``` New version bumped. Arch teams, please, test it and stabilize. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-07-31 03:52:20 UTC  ``` "enhancement" is not an appropriate priority for a security bug (it was previously a request to bump).
