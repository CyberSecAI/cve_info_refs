Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authentication in the Gabriel's FTP Server (Open & Compact FTP Server) version 1.2 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The FTP server allows connections and execution of commands without requiring a login. This is a significant weakness.
*   **Unrestricted Command Execution:**  Any FTP command, including those for listing, retrieving, and storing files, can be executed without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Access:** An attacker can gain full system access by exploiting this vulnerability. This includes the ability to read any file, upload malicious files, and potentially execute commands on the server's operating system.
*   **Data Breach/Theft:** Sensitive data can be accessed and stolen.
*   **Malware Deployment:** Attackers can upload and execute malicious software.
*   **System Manipulation:** Attackers can alter files, disrupt services, and generally control the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is network access to the vulnerable FTP service.
*   **FTP Protocol:**  The vulnerability is exploited through the standard FTP protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:**  An attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable FTP server via the network.
*   **Basic FTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs only a basic understanding of the FTP protocol and how to send commands. No special skills beyond that are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
