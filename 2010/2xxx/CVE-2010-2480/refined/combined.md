| ``` The method in question: <http://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html#cgi.escape> <http://svn.python.org/view/python/tags/r265/Lib/cgi.py?view=markup>   # at the bottom <http://code.python.org/hg/trunk/file/3be6ff1eebac/Lib/cgi.py#l1031>  "Convert the characters '&', '<' and '>' in string s to HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML. If the optional flag quote is true, the quotation mark character ('"') is also translated; this helps for inclusion in an HTML attribute value, as in <A HREF="...">. If the value to be quoted might include single- or double-quote characters, or both, consider using the quoteattr() function in the xml.sax.saxutils module instead."  cgi.escape never escapes single quote characters, which can easily lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This seems to be known by many, but a quick search reveals many are using cgi.escape for HTML attribute escaping.  The intended use of this method is unclear to me. Up to and including Mako 0.3.3, this method was the HTML escaping method. Used in this manner, single-quoted attributes with user-supplied data are easily susceptible to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.  While the documentation says "if the value to be quoted might include single- or double-quote characters... [use the] xml.sax.saxutils module instead," it also implies that this method will make input safe for HTML. Because this method escapes 4 of the 5 key XML characters, it is reasonable to expect some will use it for HTML escaping.  I suggest rewording the documentation for the method making it more clear what it should and should not be used for. I would like to see the method changed to properly escape single-quotes, but if it is not changed, the documentation should explicitly say this method does not make input safe for inclusion in HTML.  This is definitely affecting the security of some Python web applications. I already mentioned Mako, but I've found this type of bug in other frameworks and engines because the creators either called cgi.escape directly or modeled their own after it.

I guess, you should explain or point out to resources where 'single quotes' representation in a non-entity format in a HTML page has lead to XSS.  > The intended use of this method is unclear to me.

Because this method escapes 4 of the  "More suitable" for HTML would be the correct interpretation rather make the "input safe". You might check the reference documentation leading to xml.sax.saxutils.  > I suggest rewording the documentation for the method making it more > clear what it should and should not be used for.   The very next paragraph seems to address the security considerations while using the cgi module itself, rather than limiting it to cgi.escape. It says that:  "To be on the safe side, if you must pass a string gotten from a form to a shell command, you should make sure the string contains only alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and periods."  With respect your bug report:  1. Any doc change suggestions you propose?  (After pointing out the resources requested in first para)  2. If cgi.escape needs to escape single quotes, what should it be as: lsquo/rsquo (for XHTML) and &#x27; or &#39; for Others? ``` | | | |

| ``` > cgi.escape is for HTML attribute escaping only.  It is not safe for HTML attribute escaping because it does not encode single quotes.  > "More suitable" for HTML would be the correct interpretation rather make the "input safe".  "More suitable, but not quite secure"  Regardless of the intended use of this method, many many people are using it for insecure HTML entity escaping.  > you should explain or point out to resources where  > 'single quotes' representation in a non-entity format  > in a HTML page has lead to XSS.  print "<body class='%s'></body>" % cgi.escape("' onload='alert(1);' bad='")  > The very next paragraph seems to address the security considerations > while using the cgi module itself, rather than limiting it to > cgi.escape. It says that: > "To be on the safe side, if you must pass a string gotten from a form > to a shell command, you should make sure the string contains only > alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and periods."  The security concerns related to output on the web are very different from the concerns related sending user input to a shell command. The needed escaping is completely different. Also, the security advice above is woefully inadequate.   > Any doc change suggestions you propose?  Convert the characters '&', '<' and '>' in string s to their HTML entity encoded values. If the optional flag quote is true, the double-quotation mark character ('"') is also encoded. Note that the output of this method is not safe to put in an HTML attribute because it does not escape single quotes. If the value to be quoted might include single- or double-quote characters, or both, consider using the quoteattr() function in the xml.sax.saxutils module instead.  > If cgi.escape needs to escape single quotes, what should it be as: > lsquo/rsquo (for XHTML) and &#x27; or &#39; for Others?  Sorry, I should have included that in the OP. It should escape to &#x27;  It is also advised to escape the forward slash character ('/') to &#x2F;  See OWASP.org for an explanation of the complexities of the escaping: [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#RULE_.231_-_HTML_Escape_Before_Inserting_Untrusted_Data_into_HTML_Element_Content](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#RULE_.231_-_HTML_Escape_Before_Inserting_Untrusted_Data_into_HTML_Element_Content) ``` | | | |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.
(CVE-2010-1321: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C))
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- kvirc
This update of KVirc fixes a remotely exploitable format string and
directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2010-2451, CVE-2010-2452).
Additionally KVirc does not further allow remote client to send

certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.
- CVE-2010-1169: Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures,
which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.

escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
