Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2480:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `cgi.escape()` function in Python's `cgi` module does not escape single quote characters (`'`). This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when `cgi.escape()` is used to escape user-provided data within HTML attributes enclosed in single quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `cgi.escape()` function fails to properly sanitize user input for use in HTML attributes by not escaping single quotes.
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through user-controlled data, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution within a user's browser. This could allow an attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies and session data, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface websites.
    *   Perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Controlled Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when unsanitized user-provided input is included in HTML attributes.
*   **HTML Attribute Injection:** An attacker injects malicious code within an HTML attribute by using single quotes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker must be able to control or influence data that is ultimately rendered within an HTML attribute in a vulnerable application using `cgi.escape()`.
*   **Web Application Context:** The vulnerability is applicable within web applications that use `cgi.escape()` incorrectly.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `cgi.escape()` function converts `&`, `<`, and `>` characters to HTML-safe sequences but does not handle single quotes by default.
*   The vulnerability is not a problem when using double quotes for HTML attributes or when using the `xml.sax.saxutils.quoteattr()` function instead, which correctly escapes single and double quotes for HTML attributes.
*   The issue was found in applications using `cgi.escape()` for HTML attribute escaping, including Mako templating engine versions up to 0.3.3.
*   The fix involved documentation updates that clearly state the limitations of `cgi.escape()` and recommend using `xml.sax.saxutils.quoteattr()` for HTML attribute quoting.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The SUSE Security Summary Report (SUSE-SR:2010:014) mentions that python-mako was affected by this vulnerability (CVE-2010-2480), emphasizing that the improper escaping of single quotes led to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw.
*   The bug report indicates the issue was originally reported for Python versions 2.7, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.
