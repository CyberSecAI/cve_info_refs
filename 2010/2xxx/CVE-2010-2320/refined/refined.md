{
  "cve": "CVE-2010-2320",
  "description": "bozotic HTTP server (aka bozohttpd) before 20100621 allows remote attackers to list the contents of home directories, and determine the existence of user accounts, via multiple requests for URIs beginning with /~ sequences.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "bozohttpd before 20100621"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The bozohttpd server incorrectly handles requests for user directories (~user) when the user does not have a public_html directory. The server alternates between denying access and providing a directory listing with every request, leading to information disclosure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent access control",
      "Information exposure through directory listing"
     ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can discover user account names and list the contents of user home directories, which could lead to further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending multiple HTTP requests to the server for a user directory (~user) using the /~ sequence.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the bozohttpd server. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability."

   "patch_details": {
    "fixed_version": "bozohttpd version 20100621-1",
