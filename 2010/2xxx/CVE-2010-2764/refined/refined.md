Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2764:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `lists.opensuse.org` and `www.mozilla.org` directly references CVE-2010-2764 and provides a description of the vulnerability, confirming its relevance. The description matches the official CVE description: "The statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object is readable by the requestor even when the request is made across origins. This status information reveals the presence of a web server and could be used to gather information about servers on internal private networks."

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `statusText` property of an `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR) object is accessible even when the request is cross-origin (i.e., made to a different domain than the current web page). This violates the same-origin policy.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  The `statusText` property provides details about the server's response, potentially including server-specific information (e.g., server type, custom error messages). This leaks information that is not intended for cross-origin access.
    *   **Cross-Origin Policy Violation:**  The core issue is the bypass of the same-origin policy, which restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Gathering:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to probe the existence of servers on internal or private networks. By making cross-origin XHR requests and inspecting the `statusText`, they can determine if a server exists and, in some cases, gain insights into the server's configuration and software versions.
    *   **Internal Network Mapping:** The leaked information can aid attackers in mapping internal network infrastructure, potentially revealing vulnerable services to target in further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Cross-Origin Requests:** A malicious website or script makes an XHR request to a target server on a different origin, which could be an internal server.
    *   **JavaScript:** The vulnerability is exploited through JavaScript code using the `XMLHttpRequest` object, specifically by reading the `statusText` property of the response.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, acting as a malicious web server hosting malicious JavaScript code.
    *   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a victim to visit the malicious page.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the `GetStatusText()` method in `nsXMLHttpRequest.cpp` does not have the same cross-origin checks that `GetStatus()` has (as shown in the provided bugzilla comment).
*   The fix involved ensuring that `GetStatusText()` would not provide status information for cross-origin requests.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 3.5.12, 3.6.9, SeaMonkey 2.0.7, Thunderbird 3.0.7, and 3.1.3.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The severity of this vulnerability was deemed "low" because, as noted in the bugzilla comments, timing attacks can also provide information about the existence of servers. However, it still posed a potential risk, especially for internal networks.
*   This vulnerability was independently reported by two researchers, Matt Haggard and Nicholas Berthaume.

**In summary, CVE-2010-2764 is an information disclosure vulnerability caused by an incomplete cross-origin policy enforcement in handling XHR statusText, allowing malicious websites to potentially probe internal servers and gather information about their existence and configuration.**
