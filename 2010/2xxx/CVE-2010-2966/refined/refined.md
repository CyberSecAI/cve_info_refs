The provided content is related to CVE-2010-2966.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The default hashing algorithm used in the standard authentication API (`loginDefaultEncrypt()`) of Wind River Systems VxWorks is susceptible to collisions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The hashing algorithm is weak and prone to collisions.
- It is possible to find a different string that produces the same hash as a legitimate password.
- The default 'target/password' credentials are also vulnerable.
- There's a length limitation for encrypted passwords, 80 chars in VxWorks 6.4 and below, and 128 chars in VxWorks 6.5 and above.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can brute-force the password by guessing a string that produces the same hash as the legitimate password, gaining unauthorized access to the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through services that utilize the standard authentication API, such as Telnet, rlogin, and FTP.
- Requires network access to a vulnerable service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a known username and access to a service that uses the vulnerable API.
- The attacker needs the capability to send password attempts.

The document also provides mitigations, including:
- Not using the default hashing algorithm.
- Using a trusted authentication API installed with `loginEncryptInstall()`.
- Setting `LOGIN_USER_NAME` and `LOGIN_USER_PASSWORD` project parameters to empty strings at initialization to avoid registration of default credentials.
- Implementing firewall rules to restrict access to vulnerable services.
- Disabling unnecessary services such as FTP and Telnet.
- Monitoring for brute-force attacks.
