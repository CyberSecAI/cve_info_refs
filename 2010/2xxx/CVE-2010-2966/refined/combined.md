## Wind River Systems VxWorks weak default hashing algorithm in standard authentication API (loginLib)

#### Vulnerability Note VU#840249

Original Release Date: 2010-08-02 | Last Revised: 2014-06-02

---

### Overview

The hashing algorithm that is used in the standard authentication API for VxWorks is susceptible to collisions. An attacker can brute force a password by guessing a string that produces the same hash as a legitimate password.

### Description

| An attacker with a known username and access to a service (telnet, rlogin or FTP) that uses the standard authentication API (loginDefaultEncrypt (), part of loginLib) can brute force the password in a relatively short period of time. Since the hashing algorithm is susceptible to collisions, the actual password does not have to be found, just a string that produces the same hash.  For instance, when the default 'target/password' login example is used, 'y{{{{{kS' hashes to the same string as 'password'. It is thus possible to login using both 'password' and 'y{{{{{kS' as the passwords for the user 'target'.Additional information can be found in ICS-CERT advisory [ICSA-10-214-01](http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-10-214-01_VxWorks_Vulnerabilities.pdf) and on the [Metasploit Blog](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2010/08/02/shiny-old-vxworks-vulnerabilities). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can brute force a correct password by guessing a string that produces the same hash and access the relevant service as the known user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Vendors which use VxWorks in their products should not use the default hashing algorithm in standard authentication API (loginDefaultEncrypt()). A trusted authentication API should be used instead. It can be installed by means of the loginEncryptInstall() loginLib hook.In addition, and so as to avoid registration of the default 'target'/'password' credentials at init time, the LOGIN\_USER\_NAME and LOGIN\_USER\_PASSWORD project parameters/#defines should be set to empty strings (so that no user is registered using the default encryption routine). Only after the new encryption routine is registered should new users be added to the system.loginEncryptInstall allows the user to install a custom encryption routine. The custom routine <rtn> must be of the following form:STATUS encryptRoutine       (       char \*password,               /\* string to encrypt    \*/       char \*encryptedPassword       /\* resulting encryption \*/       )The <encryptedPassword> string length should be no more than :+ VxWorks 6.4 and below: 80 characters+ VxWorks 6.5 and above: 128 charactersWhen a custom encryption routine is installed, a host version of this routine must be written to replace the tool vxencrypt in host/<hostOs>/bin.Appendix #1 shows example code making use of loginEncryptInstall() to set a custom encryption routine. Depending on the VxWorks version used, either SHA-512 or SHA-256 are used.DISCLAIMER: The following example code was provided by Wind River Systems.

| **Restrict access**  Appropriate firewall rules should be implemented to restrict access to any services that use the standard authentication API. **Disable services**Services such as FTP or telnet should be disabled if not needed.**Monitor access**IDS signatures should be implemented to detect brute force attacks to services that use the standard authentication API. |

**Security Advisory Report - OBSO-1007-01**

**Wind River VxWorks: weak default hashing algorithm in standard authentication API (loginLib)**

Creation Date: 2010-07-22
Last Update: 2010-07-22

**Summary**
Wind River has published a security advisory, which states, that the default hashing algorithm that is used in the standard authentication API for VxWorks is susceptible to collisions. An attacker can brute force a password by guessing a string that produces the same hash as a legitimate password.

**Vulnerability Details**
An attacker with a known username and access to a service (telnet, rlogin or FTP) that uses the standard authentication API (loginDefaultEncrypt (), part of loginLib) can brute force the password in a relatively short period of time. Since the hashing algorithm is susceptible to collisions, the actual password does not have to be found, just a string that produces the same hash. For instance, when the default 'target/password' login example is used, 'y{{{{{kS' hashes to the same string as 'password'. It is thus possible to login using both 'password' and 'y{{{{{kS' as the passwords for the user 'target'.

Impact:
Because an attacker can brute force a correct password by guessing a string that produces the same hash and access the relevant service as a known user. Applications such as rlogin, telnet, and FTP rely on loginLib for security, and can be used to gain access to the device.

**Affected Products**
No products from Siemens Enterprise Communications are affected.

The following products include VxWorks as operating system, but none of them make use of the standard login library:

+ HiPath 4000
+ HiPath 3000 (HG 1500)
+ HiPath Wireless Convergence
+ optiPoint 410/420 HFA/SIP
+ RG 8700

**Recommended Actions**
None.
