{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Perl component within Oracle Fusion Middleware.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The provided information does not specify the exact weakness. However, based on the impact it can be inferred that it could involve insecure handling of data passed to a Perl script or inadequate sanitization, leading to potential code execution or information disclosure."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of successful exploitation is partial integrity compromise. The data could be modified by an attacker.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is local logon. This means the attacker needs to have some form of local access to the server or the system where the Oracle Fusion Middleware component is running."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have local logon privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They would need to be able to execute code in the context of the user under which the affected component is running, and have access to execute Perl scripts.",
     "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication."
