Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2006

**Vulnerable Software:** MyDMS, an open-source document management system based on PHP and MySQL.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. This means an attacker could potentially access files and directories outside of the intended webroot directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly sanitize user inputs related to file paths, which allows an attacker to use special characters like "../" to navigate the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker could read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, or other private data.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Depending on the server configuration and permissions, an attacker might be able to write malicious files to the server and execute code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is categorized as "remote," meaning it can be exploited over a network.
- **User Input:** The attack vector likely involves manipulating user-supplied input parameters that are used to construct file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the MyDMS server over the network.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know which parameters to manipulate in order to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by D. Fabian and L. Weichselbaum.
- The issue was fixed in MyDMS version 1.7.0-1+lenny1 for the Debian "lenny" distribution.
- The MyDMS package is no longer present in the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) Debian distributions.
