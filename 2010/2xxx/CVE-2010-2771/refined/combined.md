## IBM SolidDB solid.exe Handshake Request Username Field Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-125ZDI-CAN-676

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [solidDB](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/soliddb/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9983']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM solidDB. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the solid.exe process which listens by default on TCP port 1315. The code responsible for parsing the first handshake packet does not properly validate the length of the username field. By crafting an overly long value in the request an attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21439148&myns=swgimgmt&mynp=OCSSPK3V&mync=R> |
