  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist within the Accoria Web Server (Rock Web Server), including cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (XSRF), directory traversal, and format string vulnerabilities. Additionally, weak and predictable cookie generation may allow bypassing authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF)",
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Format String Vulnerability",
      "Weak/Predictable Cookie Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server administrator.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities",
      "Exploiting XSRF vulnerabilities",
      "Exploiting directory traversal vulnerabilities",
       "Exploiting format string vulnerabilities",
      "Bypassing authentication through predictable cookies"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No authentication is needed to exploit some of these vulnerabilities but may be required to exploit others.  Access to the administrative interface would be beneficial for a successful attack."
