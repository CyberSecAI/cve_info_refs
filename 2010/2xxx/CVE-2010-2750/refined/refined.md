Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2010-2750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Word handles index values within a specially crafted Word file. Specifically, a malformed index value causes memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Index Values:** The core issue lies in the failure of Microsoft Word to properly validate or handle index values within a document. This allows a malformed value to corrupt system memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Complete System Control:** The attacker can gain full control of the system, enabling them to:
    *   Install malicious programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new user accounts with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Word Document:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted Word document containing the malformed index value.
*   **Email:** An attacker could send the malicious document as an email attachment and trick the user into opening it.
*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host the malicious file on a website and entice users to visit the site and open the file. Compromised websites could also host such files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Word Document:** The attacker needs the technical ability to create a Word document containing a malformed index value that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the victim to open the malicious document, either through email or by luring them to a website.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any specific user credentials or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" severity.
*   Users with fewer user rights are at less risk than administrators, but are still vulnerable to exploitation.
*   Microsoft recommends applying the provided update to mitigate the vulnerability.
