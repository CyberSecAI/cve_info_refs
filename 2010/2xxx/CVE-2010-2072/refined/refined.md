Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Pyftpd creates log files in a temporary directory using predictable file names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable File Names:** The predictable nature of log file names makes it possible for attackers to anticipate and interact with these files.
*   **Insecure Temporary Directory Usage**: Log files are created in /tmp/ without proper file system modes which exposes sensitive information to unprivileged users

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can create a denial of service condition. This is not explained in more detail in the provided text.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Local attackers can gain access to sensitive information, such as user accounts connecting to the server and the paths they visit.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system where pyftpd is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local user privileges on the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided bug report ([#585773](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=585773)) includes details of the vulnerability and its fix.
* The suggested remediation was to use `tempfile.mkstemp` or log to `/var/log/` with proper file system modes.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in pyftpd versions 0.8.5 and 0.8.4.6+lenny1, by changing the default logging file location to `/dev/null`.
