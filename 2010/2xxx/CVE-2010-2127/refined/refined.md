- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a remote file inclusion flaw in the `gallery.php` script due to an insecure implementation of the `include` function with user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The `lang_file` parameter in `gallery.php` is not properly sanitized and is used directly in an include statement (`iinclude ($lang_file);`). This allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary remote files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `lang_file` in the `gallery.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need prior access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
