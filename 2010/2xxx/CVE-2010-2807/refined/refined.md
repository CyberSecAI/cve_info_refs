{
  "CVE-2010-2807": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in FreeType 2.4.1, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution when processing a maliciously crafted font.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect type comparisons in FreeType's handling of TrueType opcodes.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a maliciously crafted font file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious font file that is processed by a vulnerable application using FreeType. No specific network position or user privileges are explicitly mentioned, suggesting this can occur with local file handling or through web browsers/email clients rendering content.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability lies in the way FreeType handles TrueType opcodes, specifically in the `src/smooth/ftsmooth.c` and `src/truetype/ttinterp.*` files, which are corrected with improved bounds checking. The fix for the issue is provided by updating FreeType to version 2.4.2."
