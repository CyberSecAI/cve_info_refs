Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-2044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_konsultasi` component of Joomla. Specifically, the `sid` parameter in the `index.php` script is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`sid` parameter) before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker could leverage the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- **Potential for further compromise:** Depending on database privileges, an attacker might be able to modify data, or even gain control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with the `com_konsultasi` component and a malicious `sid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** Some familiarity with SQL syntax is needed to craft the injection payload

**Exploit Details:**
- The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract user credentials from the `jos_users` table. The payload:
  ```
  -5/**/union/**/select/**/all/**/1,2,3,4,concat(username,0x3a,password)c4uR,6,7,8,9/**/from/**/jos_users--
  ```
-  This payload is injected into the `sid` parameter within the URL: `http://127.0.0.1/[gubrak]/index.php?option=com_konsultasi&act=detail&sid=[gubrak]`.  The `[gubrak]` placeholder is used here, and replaced by the malicious SQL injection payload.

This information is more detailed than the basic CVE description placeholder, providing a clear understanding of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
