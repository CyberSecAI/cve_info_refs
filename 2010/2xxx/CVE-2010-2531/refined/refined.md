Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-2531:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `var_export()` function in PHP handled errors related to recursion, memory limits, or execution time. When a fatal error occurred during the execution of `var_export()`, the function would not clear its internal buffer. Instead, the contents of the buffer, which could include sensitive information, would be flushed to the user. This happened regardless of the `display_errors` setting, as the output was considered part of the intended output stream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure: The primary vulnerability is an information leak. Due to the failure to clear the buffer on fatal errors, internal program data could be exposed to an attacker.
- Lack of proper error handling: The function did not handle fatal errors gracefully by clearing the buffer before exiting.
- Insufficient output sanitization: Data was output without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: Attackers could obtain potentially sensitive data, such as internal variables, application structures or even parts of the source code if present in the variables passed to `var_export`. This could be used to further compromise the system.
- Denial of Service (Indirect): While not a direct DoS, attackers could trigger the vulnerability repeatedly to cause resource exhaustion, potentially leading to service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering fatal errors in var_export: The primary vector is to craft input that causes `var_export()` to trigger a fatal error (e.g., by causing a recursion, exceeding memory limits, or triggering a timeout).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute PHP code: The attacker must be able to execute PHP code on a vulnerable server. This could be achieved through web application vulnerabilities or by directly accessing a server running PHP.
- Knowledge of the application's internal data structures: Attackers might need some understanding of the data structures being processed in order to craft an input to elicit the desired information.
- No special privileges: No special privileges are necessary to exploit this vulnerability since this is a flaw in the PHP code execution itself.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**
- The issue affects PHP versions 5.2.x and 5.3.x.
- The fix was implemented by rewriting `var_export()` to use `smart_str` instead of output buffering.
- Patches were released in PHP 5.2.14 and 5.3.3.
- Various vendors like Red Hat, SUSE, Debian and HP addressed this vulnerability in their products by updating the affected PHP packages.

In summary, CVE-2010-2531 is an information disclosure vulnerability in PHP's `var_export()` function that can expose internal application data when a fatal error occurs. The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting specific inputs that lead to a recursive loop or excessive memory usage, and has been addressed in PHP versions 5.2.14 and 5.3.3.
