| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=617673#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-23 17:31:15 UTC  ``` The upstream PHP 5.2.14 and 5.3.3 releases corrected an information disclosure flaw where the var_export() function would disclose data if a fatal error occurred due to recursion, memory_limit, or execution time.  The buffer is never cleared and is flushed to the user, regardless of the configured display_errors setting, because it is considered part of the output.  This could lead to a disclosure of possibly sensitive information.  The name [CVE-2010-2531](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2531) has been assigned to this issue.  An example to test:  % cat test.php #!/usr/bin/php <?php @$obj->p =& $obj; var_export($obj, true); ?> % php test.php PHP Fatal error:  Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency? in test.php on line 4 stdClass::__set_state(array(    'p' =>    stdClass::__set_state(array(      'p' =>      stdClass::__set_state(array(        'p' =>        stdClass::__set_state(array( % cat test2.php #!/usr/bin/php <?php $a[] =& $a; var_export($a, true); ?> % php test2.php PHP Fatal error:  Nesting level too deep - recursive dependency? in test.php on line 4 array (   0 =>    array (     0 =>      array (       0 =>        array (         0 =>          array (   The upstream changes prevent any output from displaying, so should only display the "PHP Fatal error".  The upstream fix:  <http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=301143>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=617673#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-23 17:41:18 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the php package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.  This issue affects the versions of the php package, as shipped with Fedora release 12 and 13 (although 5.3.3-1 is currently an updates candidate).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=617673#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-29 21:34:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0919 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0919.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=617673#c6)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-29 22:38:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue is not planned to be fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 due to this product being in Production 3 of its maintenance life-cycle, where only qualified security errata of important and critical impact are addressed.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- samba
A buffer overflow in the sid\_parse() function of samba could
potentially be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2010-3069).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# [International PHP Conference](http://phpconference.com/)

[25-Sep-2010]

Not just another conference - this year has seen some high-valued
conferences (like our IPC Spring Edition in Berlin) and we are already
preparing the next big PHP conference. But this year makes a difference.
It's the 10th. anniversary of the International PHP Conference. Being in
business for ten years, we met some great people, made true fans and
encouraged PHP developers all over the world to commit their passion for
web-development to a growing community, that is behind some of the most
well-known websites today.

Of course, a great event is nothing without great developers and we are very
happy to welcome the PHP community to our next International PHP Conference
2010! Again, this conference is packed with workshops, sessions and keynotes
on some of the most trending topics in PHP and web development today. Wether
you are the developer dealing with core PHP features, the project lead that
is in continuous integration or the CTO looking for professional solutions,
this conference is the place to be. Not because of our 10 years of
experience in bringing together some of the most experienced heads in PHP
development - but because of this conference being one of Europe's leading
technology events that have been made possible by a really passionate
community. And that is ... by you.

# [PHP 5.3.3 Released!](http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2)

[22-Jul-2010]

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
availability of PHP 5.3.3. This release focuses on improving the
stability and security of the PHP 5.3.x branch with over 100 bug
fixes, some of which are security related. All users are encouraged
to upgrade to this release.

**Backwards incompatible change:**

* Methods with the same name as the last element of a namespaced class name
  will no longer be treated as constructor. This change doesn't affect
  non-namespaced classes.

  `<?php

  namespace Foo;

  class Bar {

  public function Bar() {

  // treated as constructor in PHP 5.3.0-5.3.2

  // treated as regular method in PHP 5.3.3

  }

  }

  ?>`

  There is no impact on migration from 5.2.x because namespaces were only introduced in PHP 5.3.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.3.3:**

* Rewrote var\_export() to use smart\_str rather than output buffering, prevents data disclosure if a fatal error occurs (CVE-2010-2531).

* Fixed a possible memory corruption in pack().
* Fixed a possible memory corruption in substr\_replace().
* Fixed a possible memory corruption in addcslashes().
* Fixed a possible stack exhaustion inside fnmatch().
* Fixed a possible dechunking filter buffer overflow.
* Fixed a possible arbitrary memory access inside sqlite extension.
* Fixed string format validation inside phar extension.
* Fixed handling of session variable serialization on certain prefix characters.
* Fixed a NULL pointer dereference when processing invalid XML-RPC requests (Fixes CVE-2010-0397, bug #51288).
* Fixed SplObjectStorage unserialization problems (CVE-2010-2225).
* Fixed possible buffer overflows in mysqlnd\_list\_fields, mysqlnd\_change\_user.
* Fixed possible buffer overflows when handling error packets in mysqlnd.

**Key enhancements in PHP 5.3.3 include:**

* Upgraded bundled sqlite to version 3.6.23.1.
* Upgraded bundled PCRE to version 8.02.
* Added FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) SAPI.
* Added stream filter support to mcrypt extension.
* Added full\_special\_chars filter to ext/filter.
* Fixed a possible crash because of recursive GC invocation.
* Fixed bug #52238 (Crash when an Exception occured in iterator\_to\_array).
* Fixed bug #52041 (Memory leak when writing on uninitialized variable returned from function).
* Fixed bug #52060 (Memory leak when passing a closure to method\_exists()).
* Fixed bug #52001 (Memory allocation problems after using variable variables).
* Fixed bug #51723 (Content-length header is limited to 32bit integer with Apache2 on Windows).
* Fixed bug #48930 (\_\_COMPILER\_HALT\_OFFSET\_\_ incorrect in PHP >= 5.3).

For users upgrading from PHP 5.2 there is a migration guide available on
[http://php.net/migration53](/migration53), detailing the changes between those
releases and PHP 5.3.

are security related.

This release marks the end of the active support for PHP
5.2. Following this release the PHP 5.2 series will receive no further
active bug maintenance. Security fixes for PHP 5.2 might be published on a
case by cases basis. All users of PHP 5.2 are encouraged to upgrade to

# [TestFest 2010](http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-06-23-1)

[23-Jun-2010]

PHP is proud to announce TestFest 2010. TestFest is PHP's annual campaign
to increase the overall code coverage of PHP through PHPT tests. During
TestFest, PHP User Groups and individuals around the world organize local
events where new tests are written and new contributors are introduced to
PHP's testing suite.

Last year was very successful with 887 tests submitted and a code coverage
increase of 2.5%. This year we hope to do better.

TestFest's own SVN repository and reporting tools are back online for this
year's event. New to TestFest this year are automated test environment build
tools as well as screencasts showing those build tools in action.

Please visit the [TestFest
2010](http://wiki.php.net/qa/testfest-2010) wiki page for all the details on events being organized in your area,
or find out how you can organize your own event.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-2531 CVE-2011-0420 CVE-2011-0421 CVE-2011-0708
                 CVE-2011-1153 CVE-2011-1466 CVE-2011-1471 CVE-2011-2202

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in PHP, which could lead to
denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-2531

   An information leak was found in the var_export() function.

CVE-2011-0421

   The Zip module could crash.

CVE-2011-0708

   An integer overflow was discovered in the Exif module.

CVE-2011-1466

   An integer overflow was discovered in the Calendar module.

CVE-2011-1471

   The Zip module was prone to denial of service through malformed
   archives.

CVE-2011-2202

   Path names in form based file uploads (RFC 1867) were incorrectly
   validated.

This update also fixes two bugs, which are not treated as security
issues, but fixed nonetheless, see README.Debian.security for details
on the scope of security support for PHP (CVE-2011-0420, CVE-2011-1153).

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny12.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.6-12.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: CVE request, php var_export

hi,

I would like to request a new # for a flaw in php's var_export. The
reason is that a fatal error occurs due to recursion, memory limit or
execution time var_export bails out. The buffer is never cleared and
it flushes to the user. It's not affected by display_errors() since
its considered part of the output.

Fix already commited to trunk, 5.2 and 5.3 and will be in the next PHP
releases (5.2.14 and 5.3.3):

<http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=301143>

Cheers,

# [International PHP Conference](http://phpconference.com/)

[25-Sep-2010]

Not just another conference - this year has seen some high-valued
conferences (like our IPC Spring Edition in Berlin) and we are already
preparing the next big PHP conference. But this year makes a difference.
It's the 10th. anniversary of the International PHP Conference. Being in
business for ten years, we met some great people, made true fans and
encouraged PHP developers all over the world to commit their passion for
web-development to a growing community, that is behind some of the most
well-known websites today.

Of course, a great event is nothing without great developers and we are very
happy to welcome the PHP community to our next International PHP Conference
2010! Again, this conference is packed with workshops, sessions and keynotes
on some of the most trending topics in PHP and web development today. Wether
you are the developer dealing with core PHP features, the project lead that
is in continuous integration or the CTO looking for professional solutions,
this conference is the place to be. Not because of our 10 years of
experience in bringing together some of the most experienced heads in PHP
development - but because of this conference being one of Europe's leading
technology events that have been made possible by a really passionate
community. And that is ... by you.

# [PHP 5.3.3 Released!](http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2)

[22-Jul-2010]

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
availability of PHP 5.3.3. This release focuses on improving the
stability and security of the PHP 5.3.x branch with over 100 bug
fixes, some of which are security related. All users are encouraged
to upgrade to this release.

**Backwards incompatible change:**

* Methods with the same name as the last element of a namespaced class name
  will no longer be treated as constructor. This change doesn't affect
  non-namespaced classes.

  `<?php

  namespace Foo;

  class Bar {

  public function Bar() {

  // treated as constructor in PHP 5.3.0-5.3.2

  // treated as regular method in PHP 5.3.3

  }

  }

  ?>`

  There is no impact on migration from 5.2.x because namespaces were only introduced in PHP 5.3.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.3.3:**

* Rewrote var\_export() to use smart\_str rather than output buffering, prevents data disclosure if a fatal error occurs (CVE-2010-2531).

* Fixed string format validation inside phar extension.
* Fixed handling of session variable serialization on certain prefix characters.
* Fixed a NULL pointer dereference when processing invalid XML-RPC requests (Fixes CVE-2010-0397, bug #51288).
* Fixed SplObjectStorage unserialization problems (CVE-2010-2225).
* Fixed possible buffer overflows in mysqlnd\_list\_fields, mysqlnd\_change\_user.
* Fixed possible buffer overflows when handling error packets in mysqlnd.

**Key enhancements in PHP 5.3.3 include:**

* Fixed bug #52060 (Memory leak when passing a closure to method\_exists()).
* Fixed bug #52001 (Memory allocation problems after using variable variables).
* Fixed bug #51723 (Content-length header is limited to 32bit integer with Apache2 on Windows).

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A stack buffer overlow exists in Apple Type Services' handling of embedded fonts. Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1800

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: CFNetwork permits anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue does not affect the Mail application. This issue is addressed by disabling anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6.3. Credit to Aaron Sigel of vtty.com, Jean-Luc Giraud of Citrix, Tomas Bjurman of Sirius IT, and Wan-Teh Chang of Google, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **ClamAV**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0098, CVE-2010-1311

  Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues by updating ClamAV to version 0.96.1. ClamAV is distributed only with Mac OS X Server systems. Further information is available via the ClamAV website at <http://www.clamav.net/>

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1801

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files. Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking. Credit to Rodrigo Rubira Branco from the Check Point Vulnerability Discovery Team (VDT) for reporting this issue.

* **libsecurity**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1802

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position who can obtain a domain name that differs only in the last characters from the name of a legitimate domain may impersonate hosts in that domain

  Description: An issue exists in the handling of certificate host names. For host names containing three or more components, the last characters are not properly compared. In the case of a name containing exactly three components, only the last character is not checked. For example, if an attacker in a privileged network position could obtain a certificate for www.example.con the attacker can impersonate www.example.com. This issue is addressed through improved handling of certificate host names. Credit to Peter Speck for reporting this issue.

* **PHP**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1205

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4
