The provided content describes a bug in Zabbix version 1.8.2 where graph titles are sometimes URL-encoded when passed as URL parameters. Specifically, forward slashes `/` are encoded as `%2F`. This issue affects the display of graph titles in the frontend.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The graph title is not properly decoded when being passed in the URL parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect URL encoding/decoding.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The displayed graph title is not user-friendly as URL encoded characters such as `%2F` are displayed instead of `/`.
- **Attack vectors**: Passing a graph title containing forward slashes in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to generate a URL with the graph title in the query parameter.

The provided information describes a bug, not a vulnerability that leads to a security issue.
