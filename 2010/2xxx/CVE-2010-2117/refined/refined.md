{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how browsers handle the news and nntp protocols.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) through resource exhaustion",
      "Blocking DoS"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to system blocking and overload, and in some cases, application crashes, due to the excessive resource consumption triggered by the news and nntp protocol handlers.  In some instances, the attack does not cause blocking, but still results in resource exhaustion, though slower.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a web page with a large number of iframes that trigger the news or nntp protocol handlers.",
      "Using JavaScript to trigger the news or nntp protocol handlers."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or host a malicious web page and lure a victim to access it with a vulnerable browser. No special privileges are required."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Mozilla Firefox 3.0.19 (and likely 3.5.x and 3.6.x)",
    "Internet Explorer 6 (6.0.2900.2180)",
    "Internet Explorer 8 (8.0.7600.16385)",
     "Google Chrome 1.0.154.48",
    "Opera 9.52"
  ],
    "more_information": "The article mentions that the attack can be triggered with or without JavaScript, by using a web page with a large number of iframes. The exploit for the news protocol works on Firefox 3.0.19, IE6, IE8, Chrome 1.0.154.48 and Opera 9.52. The exploit for nntp protocol works in Firefox 3.0.19, IE6 and Opera 9.52. The attack is described as a blocking and resource-exhaustion DoS. It is also noted that IE8 crashes without a news client installed, while Opera experiences slower resource exhaustion compared to other browsers."
