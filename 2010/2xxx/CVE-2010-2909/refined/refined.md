Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-2909

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `cid` parameter in the `ttvideo.php` file before it is used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection.  The `cid` parameter, obtained via `JRequest::getVar`, is directly inserted into an SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to the retrieval of sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (`username` and `password` from `jos_users` table as shown in the sample exploit).
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could also potentially modify or delete data in the database, though this is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided exploit code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP GET request.  The `cid` parameter is passed within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application with the TTVideo component installed.
- No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, since the vulnerable code is reachable by any user visiting the site.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `ttvideo.php` (line 188) within the `getVideo` function:

   ```php
   function getVideo($id) {
       $db = $this->getDBO();
       $db->setQuery("SELECT * from #__ttvideo WHERE id=$id");
       $video = $db->loadObject();
       if ($video === null)
           JError::raiseError(500, 'Video with ID: '.$id.' not found.');
       return $video;
   }
   ```
   - The `$id` variable is directly derived from the `cid` parameter passed through `JRequest::getVar` in `ttvideoController.php` (line 40).

- The provided sample exploit demonstrates how to use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract user information:
  ```
  http://site/path/index.php?option=com_ttvideo&task=video&cid=-1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,CONCAT(username,0x3A,password),10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 FROM jos_users
  ```

**Fix:**
- The recommended fix is to use `JRequest::getInt` instead of `JRequest::getVar` to ensure that the input is an integer, which would prevent SQL injection attacks.
