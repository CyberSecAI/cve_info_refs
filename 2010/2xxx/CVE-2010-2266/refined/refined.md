Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2010-2266:

**Vulnerability 1: Remote Source Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of the `::$DATA` stream identifier in the URL path by nginx on Windows.
*   **Weakness:**  The web server discloses the source code of requested files when `::$DATA` is appended to the URL.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information contained in the web server's source code, including configuration details, database credentials, and other application secrets.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with `::$DATA` appended to the URL of a file. For example: `http://[webserver IP][:port]/index.html::$DATA`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to the network where the target server is running.

**Vulnerability 2: Remote Denial of Service (DoS) with Memory Corruption**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of encoded directory traversal sequences such as `%c0.%c0.` within URLs by nginx on Windows.
*   **Weakness:** The server fails to correctly process these sequences, leading to memory corruption when attempting to traverse directories.
*   **Impact:** The memory corruption results in a denial of service (DoS), causing the server to crash.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with multiple instances of the `%c0.%c0.` sequence in the URL. For example: `http://[webserver IP][:port]/%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%20`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to the network where the target server is running.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are specific to the Windows version of nginx 0.8.36.
*   The DoS vulnerability is described as causing memory corruption where memory registers get overwritten with incorrect path variables.
