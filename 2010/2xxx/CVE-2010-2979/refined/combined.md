### **Cisco CleanAir**

 **Interference Detection and Classification** — CleanAir can classify over 20 different types of interference within 5 to 30 seconds. A custom chipset is optimized to allow detection of non-Wi-Fi wireless transmissions while simultaneously serving network traffic. Because the detection and classification takes place on inline silicon, rather than in software that consumes processing power, the 3500 Series produces interference visualizations that are much more detailed and precise than those produced by competing systems. This feature enables more intelligent decisions and policies, for automatic remedial action and faster troubleshooting.

 **Per-Interference Severity Impact** — CleanAir provides full visibility into the performance and security of the wireless network with an easy to read air quality index that identifies problem areas and locates them in the context of access point, floor, building, and campus. An air quality index provides a snapshot of the performance and impact of interference on the wireless network. Network administrators can set alerts so that they are notified when air quality falls below a desired threshold. The system can also be configured to automatically enforce security or management policies. Cisco CleanAir generates reports to help network administrators prioritize interference issues that require immediate attention and easily drill down into the details for further network analysis.

 **Air Quality by Access Point** — Administrators can now get an air quality rating on a per radio basis to gauge the impact of interference on the network. This feature provides advanced troubleshooting capabilities that allow organizations to view and use real-time interference data from individual CleanAir access points through the WLAN controller GUI or CLI. Administrators can quickly understand the severity and impact of non-Wi-Fi interference on network performance. This feature enables more intelligent decisions and policies for automatic remedial action and faster troubleshooting.

 **Air Quality Index Alarm Threshold** — This feature provides 24 x 7, on-demand network monitoring. It automatically sends alerts when user-defined thresholds are exceeded for enhanced visibility and control. Air quality thresholds generate alerts, are user configurable and can be used by any SNMP trap receiver for simple integration into existing network management infrastructure.

 **Rapid Update Mode** — Real-time air quality charts show interferers per CleanAir access point. Power and channel utilization is updated at 30-second intervals. Organizations can use these charts to quickly view the impact of interference in near real-time and on a per radio, per channel basis.

 **Spectrum Expert Connect Mode** — Any CleanAir access point can be configured as a network-connected sensor. Administrators can instantaneously access any network location covered by a CleanAir access point using the Spectrum Expert configuration. This feature improves response time and eliminates the need for travel to analyze interference data.

 **Interference Alarms Sent as SNMP Messages** — This feature allows the use of industry-standard SNMP interfaces to monitor the presence and severity of non-Wi-Fi interference on many network management platforms. Each time an interference device is classified by a CleanAir access point, details about the device type and severity of impact are transmitted via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) messages.

 **Spectrum Management Information Base (MIB)** — This feature allows organizations and integrators to create their own suite of network monitoring applications using CleanAir data. An industry-standard spectrum MIB was created to support third-party products in integrating with CleanAir technology.

 **Event-Driven Radio Resource Management** — Interference data from Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi devices is detected and classified by CleanAir access points and then integrated into radio resource management (RRM) technology for automatic interference mitigation. RRM intelligently and automatically adjusts network settings and channels to avoid RF interference and optimize network performance. This feature increases network reliability and reduces false positives associated with measurements based on Wi-Fi only.

 **Persistent Device Avoidance** —CleanAir access points remember intermittent yet destructive interference and avoid the channels with the interference. CleanAir can determine if interference is persistent from a stationary source, even from an intermittent device such as a microwave oven, video camera, or network bridge link. The access points within range of the interference will change channels and will remember to avoid the impacted channels in the future.

### **Support of 500 Access Points per Cisco 5500 Series Wireless Controller**

A single Cisco 5500 Series Wireless Controller can now support up to 500 Cisco Aironet Access Points.

### Cisco 5508 Series Controllers Location Support

The Cisco 5508 Series Controller can now support up to 7000 clients and 5000 RFID tags when using the location support.

### **Cisco Video Stream Technology**

A new system wide set of features of the Cisco Unified Wireless Network enables reliable and consistent delivery of multicast streaming video over the WLAN.

### **Enhanced Functionality for Wireless Controller Base Licenses**

Cisco OfficeExtend, Enterprise Wireless Mesh and Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) data encryption advanced features are now included in the wireless controller base license.

### **Passive Client Support**

Passive client support establishes TCP/IP communication with wireless clients configured with static IP addresses without any manual configuration changes on the client. With this feature, the controller supports clients that associate with the network and go into sleep mode without requiring reauthentication.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Passive Client feature is supported on the Cisco 2100 and 5508 Series Controllers.

---

### **Enhanced Access Point Update and Joining Capability**

The controller can handle up to 500 simultaneous access point joins and access point image downloads.

### **SIP Call Admission Control**

SIP call admission control provides bandwidth reservation for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based voice calls. Historically, bandwidth is reserved via Traffic Specification (TSpec) but most SIP clients do not support TSpec, which prevents bandwidth reservation. This feature enables the Controller to provision the bandwidth requirement for SIP calls and allocate or reserve bandwidth on per-usage or per-call basis.

This feature is applicable for non-TSPEC based SIP Calls. SIP Call Snooping should be enabled, only if there are non-TSPEC SIP based clients. We recommend that you use the SIP CAC feature only with static CAC.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do not use SIP CAC with Load-based CAC.

---

Load-based CAC statistics are based on the AP Radio statistics that take into consideration 802.11e QoS information in the 802.11 packets. If there are any SIP-based voice calls from clients that do not have 802.11e QoS support, those calls will not be taken into account to limit calls based on Load-based CAC.

### Max Call Limits for SIP CAC

You can configure the SIP CAC feature to set a maximum call limit. This feature must be configured only for SIP-based CAC to limit the number of calls per radio. By default, this feature is disabled. The default value for maximum number of calls is 0, which indicates there is no check for Max call limit.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The Max call limit feature is applicable only for non-TSPEC SIP based Calls, even though it counts TSPEC based calls if configured. This feature has a known limitation wherein, there is no option to set a limit for roaming-in calls. The Max Call limit includes both direct and roaming-in calls. If the maximum call limit is reached, new or roaming-in call will fail.

---

### Per WLAN Radius Source Support

The controller uses the management interface as identity. If the RADIUS server is on a directly connected dynamic interface, the traffic is sourced from the dynamic interface. Otherwise, the management IP address is used.

If the feature is enabled, the controller uses the interface specified on the WLAN configuration as identity and source for all RADIUS related traffic on the WLAN.

You can configure this feature by entering the following command:

(Cisco Controller) > config wlan radius\_server overwrite-interface enable <wlan-id>

## FIPS Support

Cisco Controller Release 7.0.98.0 has been awarded Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 validation.

### Finding the Software Release

To find the software release running on your controller, click  **Monitor** and look at the Software Version field under Controller Summary on the controller GUI, or enter  **show sysinfo** on the controller CLI.

### Special Rules for Upgrading to Controller Software Release 7.0.98.0

Before upgrading your controller to software release 7.0.98.0, you must comply with the following rules:

* Before you download a software image or an ER.aes file to a 2100 series controller or a controller network module, use the  **show memory statistics CLI** command to see the current amount of free memory. If the controller has less than 90 MB of free memory, you need to reboot it before downloading the file.
* Before you use an AP801 series lightweight access point with controller software release 7.0.98.0, you must upgrade the software in the Cisco 860 and 880 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) to Cisco IOS 12.4(22)T and the software in the Cisco 890 Series Integrated Services Router to Cisco IOS 12.4(22)YB.
* Make sure you have a TFTP or FTP server available for the software upgrade. Keep these guidelines in mind when setting up a TFTP or FTP server:

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Controller software release 7.0.98.0 is larger than 32 MB; therefore, you must make sure that your TFTP server supports files that are larger than 32 MB. Some TFTP servers that support files of this size are tftpd and the TFTP server within the WCS. If you attempt to download the 7.0.98.0 controller software and your TFTP server does not support files of this size, the following error message appears: “TFTP failure while storing in flash.”

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you are upgrading through the service port, the TFTP or FTP server must be on the same subnet as the service port because the service port is not routable, or you must create static routes on the controller.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you are upgrading through the distribution system network port, the TFTP or FTP server can be on the same or a different subnet because the distribution system port is routable.

–![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A third-party TFTP or FTP server cannot run on the same computer as WCS because the WCS built-in TFTP or FTP server and the third-party TFTP or FTP server require the same communication port.

* The AP-count evaluation licenses for the 7.0 and the 6.0 releases are different. If you downgrade from a 7.0 release to a 6.0 release, you must activate the AP-count evaluation license of the 6.0 release after you downgrade. Similarly, if you upgrade from a 6.0 release to a 7.0 release, you must activate the AP-count evaluation license of the 7.0 release after you upgrade. If you do not activate the AP-count license, then the AP-count is shown as 0.
* You can upgrade or downgrade the controller software only between certain releases. In some instances, you must first install an intermediate release prior to upgrading to software release 7.0.98.0.  [Table 1](/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/release/notes/crn7-0.html#68333)  shows the upgrade path that you must follow before downloading software release 7.0.98.0.

Table 1 Upgrade Path to Controller Software Release 7.0.98.0

| Current Software Release | Upgrade Path to 7.0.98.0 Software |
| --- | --- |
| 3.2.78.0 or later 3.2 release | Upgrade to 4.0.206.0 or later 4.0 release, then upgrade to 4.2.176.0, before upgrading to 7.0.98.0. |
| 4.0.155.5 or later 4.0 release | Upgrade to 4.2.176.0 before upgrading to 7.0.98.0. |
| 4.1.171.0 or later 4.1 release | Upgrade to 4.2.176.0 before upgrading to 7.0.98.0. |
| 4.1.191.xM | Upgrade to 4.1.192.35M and then to 6.0.182.0 before upgrading to 7.0.98.0. |
| 4.1.192.xM | You can upgrade directly to 7.0.98.0. |
| 4.2.130.0 or earlier 4.2 release | Upgrade to 4.2.176.0 before upgrading to 7.0.98.0. |
| 4.2.173.0 or later 4.2 release | You can upgrade directly to 7.0.98.0. |
| 4.2.209.0 or later 4.2 release | You can upgrade directly to 7.0.98.0. |
| 5.0.148.0 or later 5.0 release | You can upgrade directly to 7.0.98.0. |
| 5.1.151.0 or later 5.1 release | Upgrade to a 5.2 or a 6.0 release and then upgrade to 7.0.98.0. |
| 5.2.157.0 or later 5.2 release | You can upgrade directly to 7.0.98.0. |
| 6.0.188.0 or later 6.0 release | You can upgrade directly to 7.0.98.0. |
| 6.0.196.0 or later 6.0 release | You can upgrade directly to 7.0.98.0. |

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When you upgrade the controller to an intermediate software release, wait until all of the access points joined to the controller are upgraded to the intermediate release before you install the 7.0.98.0 software. In large networks, it can take some time to download the software on each access point.

---

* We recommend that you install the Cisco Unified Wireless Network Controller Boot Software 5.2.157.0 ER.aes file on all controller platforms. This file resolves CSCsm03461 and is necessary in order for you to view the version information for ER.aes files in the output of the  **show sysinfo** CLI command. If you do not install this ER.aes file, your controller does not obtain the fix for this defect, and “N/A” appears in the Emergency Image Version field in the output of this command.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You cannot install the Cisco Unified Wireless Network Controller Boot Software 5.2.157.0 ER.aes file on Cisco 5500 Series Controller platform.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The ER.aes files are independent from the controller software files. You can run any controller software file with any ER.aes file. However, installing the latest boot software file (5.2.157.0 ER.aes) ensures that the boot software modifications in all of the previous and current boot software ER.aes files are installed.

---

![caut.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)

---

**Caution**
![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you require a downgrade from one release to another, you may lose the configuration from your current release. The workaround is to reload the previous controller configuration files saved on the backup server or to reconfigure the controller.

## Special Rules for Upgrading to Controller Software 7.0.98.0 in Mesh Networks

![caut.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)

---

**Caution**
![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Before upgrading your controller to software release 7.0.98.0 in a mesh network, you must comply with the following rules.

---

### Upgrade Compatibility Matrix

 [Table 5](/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/release/notes/crn7-0.html#82103)  outlines the upgrade compatibility of controller mesh and nonmesh releases and indicates the intermediate software releases required as part of the upgrade path.

### Software Upgrade Notes

The software upgrade notes are as follows:

* You can upgrade from 4.1.192.22M and 4.1.192.135M to 6.0.182.0 without any configuration file loss. See  [Table 5](/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/release/notes/crn7-0.html#82103)  for the available upgrade paths.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you downgrade to a mesh release, you must then reconfigure the controller. We recommend that you save the configuration from the mesh release before upgrading to release 7.0.98.0 for the first time. Then, you can reapply the configuration if you need to downgrade.

---

* You cannot downgrade from controller software release 7.0.98.0 to a mesh release (for example, 4.1.190.5, 4.1.191.22M, or 4.1.192.xM) without losing your configuration settings.
* Configuration files are in the binary state immediately after upgrade from a mesh release to controller software release 7.0.98.0. After a reset, the XML configuration file is selected.
* Do not edit XML files.
* Any field with an invalid value is filtered out and set to default by the XML validation engine. Validation occurs during bootup.
* If you upgrade the controller from software release 4.1.191.xM to 4.1.192.xM and then to software release 6.0.182.0, the controller might reboot without a crash file. To work around this problem, manually reset the controller without saving the configuration after you upgrade the controller to software release 7.0.98.0. Also, make sure to check the RRM configuration settings after the reset to verify that they are correct (CSCsv50357).

## Upgrading to a New Software Release

When you upgrade the controller’s software, the software on the controller’s associated access points is also automatically upgraded. When an access point is loading software, each of its LEDs blinks in succession. Up to 10 access points can be concurrently upgraded from the controller.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The 5500 series controllers can download the 7.0.98.0 software to 500 access points simultaneously.

---

![caut.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/caut.gif)

---

**Caution**
![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do not power down the controller or any access point during this process; otherwise, you might corrupt the software image. Upgrading a controller with a large number of access points can take as long as 30 minutes, depending on the size of your network. However, with the increased number of concurrent access point upgrades supported in software release 4.0.206.0 and later, the upgrade time should be significantly reduced. The access points must remain powered, and the controller must not be reset during this time.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) In controller software release 5.2 or later, the WLAN override feature has been removed from both the controller GUI and CLI. If your controller is configured for WLAN override and you upgrade to controller software release 7.0.98.0, the controller deletes the WLAN configuration and broadcasts all WLANs. You can specify that only certain WLANs be transmitted by configuring access point groups. Each access point advertises only the enabled WLANs that belong to its access point group.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If a WiSM controller is heavily loaded with access points and clients and is running heavy traffic, a software upgrade sometimes causes an Ethernet receive-path lockup and the hardware watchdog sometimes trips. You might need to reset the controller to return to normal operation.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do not install the 7.0.98.0 controller software file and the 5.2.157.0 ER.aes boot software file at the same time. Install one file and reboot the controller; then install the other file and reboot the controller.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When upgrading from 5.2.193.0 to 7.0.98.0 release, access points with names that contain spaces will lose their configured name after the space. For example, if an access point was named “APTestName 12”, after upgrade, when the access point rejoins the controller, the name is truncated to “APTestName”.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If the SSID is associated with a dynamic interface, then the DHCP Option 82 that you configure must be enabled on the dynamic interface. Otherwise, the upgrade may not occur as expected.

---

### Safety Information

Follow the guidelines in this section to ensure proper operation and safe use of the controllers and access points.

### FCC Safety Compliance Statement

FCC Compliance with its action in ET Docket 96-8, has adopted a safety standard for human exposure to RF electromagnetic energy emitted by FCC-certified equipment. When used with approved Cisco Aironet antennas, Cisco Aironet products meet the uncontrolled environmental limits found in OET-65 and ANSI C95.1, 1991. Proper operation of this radio device according to the instructions in this publication results in user exposure substantially below the FCC recommended limits.

### Safety Precautions

For your safety, and to help you achieve a good installation, read and follow these safety precautions. They may save your life!

 **1.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If you are installing an antenna for the first time, for your own safety as well as others, seek professional assistance. Your Cisco sales representative can explain which mounting method to use for the size and type of antenna you are about to install.

 **2.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Select your installation site with safety as well as performance in mind. Electric power lines and phone lines look alike. For your safety, assume that any overhead line can kill you.

 **3.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Call your electric power company. Tell them your plans and ask them to come look at your proposed installation. This is a small inconvenience considering your life is at stake.

 **4.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Plan your installation carefully and completely before you begin. Successfully raising a mast or tower is largely a matter of coordination. Each person should be assigned to a specific task and should know what to do and when to do it. One person should be in charge of the operation to issue instructions and watch for signs of trouble.

 **5.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When installing an antenna, remember:

 **a.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do not use a metal ladder.

 **b.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do not work on a wet or windy day.

 **c.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do dress properly—shoes with rubber soles and heels, rubber gloves, long-sleeved shirt or jacket.

 **6.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If the assembly starts to drop, get away from it and let it fall. Remember that the antenna, mast, cable, and metal guy wires are all excellent conductors of electrical current. Even the slightest touch of any of these parts to a power line completes an electrical path through the antenna and the installer: you!

 **7.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If any part of an antenna system should come in contact with a power line, do not touch it or try to remove it yourself. Call your local power company. They will remove it safely.

 **8.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If an accident should occur with the power lines, call for qualified emergency help immediately.

### Installation Instructions

Refer to the appropriate quick start guide or hardware installation guide for instructions on installing controllers and access points.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) To meet regulatory restrictions, all external antenna configurations must be professionally installed.

---

Personnel installing the controllers and access points must understand wireless techniques and grounding methods. Access points with internal antennas can be installed by an experienced IT professional.

The controller must be installed by a network administrator or qualified IT professional, and the proper country code must be selected. Following installation, access to the controller should be password protected by the installer to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and ensure proper unit functionality.

## Using the Cisco 5500 Series Controller USB Console Port

The USB console port on the 5500 series controllers connects directly to the USB connector of a PC using a USB Type A-to-5-pin mini Type B cable.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The 4-pin mini Type B connector is easily confused with the 5-pin mini Type B connector. They are not compatible. Only the 5-pin mini Type B connector can be used.

---

For operation with Microsoft Windows, the Cisco Windows USB console driver must be installed on any PC connected to the console port. With this driver, you can plug and unplug the USB cable into and from the console port without affecting Windows HyperTerminal operations.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Only one console port can be active at a time. When a cable is plugged into the USB console port, the RJ-45 port becomes inactive. Conversely, when the USB cable is removed from the USB port, the RJ-45 port becomes active.

---

## Important Notes for Controllers and Nonmesh Access Points

This section describes important information about controllers and nonmesh lightweight access points.

### Upgrading to 6.0.199.4 or 7.0.98.0 Can Disrupt DHCP Service When Using Controller’s Internal DHCP Feature

Upgrading to controller release 6.0.196.0 or 7.0.98.0 can cause client devices to fail to complete DHCP. To work around this problem, use an external DHCP server, such as a router or a Layer-3 switch. This defect is described in CSCth68708, which is visible in the Bug Toolkit on Cisco.com at this URL:

 [http://tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/](//tools.cisco.com/Support/BugToolKit/)

### WPlus License Features Included in Base License

All features included in a Wireless LAN Controller WPlus license are now included in the base license; this change is introduced in release 7.0.98.0. There are no changes to WCS BASE and PLUS licensing.

These WPlus license features are included in the base license:

* Office Extend AP
* Enterprise Mesh
* CAPWAP Data Encryption

The licensing change can affect features on your wireless LAN when you upgrade or downgrade software releases, so you should be aware of these guidelines:

* If you have a WPlus license and you upgrade from 6.0.18x to 7.0.98.0: Your license file contains both Basic and WPlus license features. You will not see any disruption in feature availability and operation.
* If you have a WPlus license and you downgrade from 7.0.98.0 to 6.0.196.0, 6.0.188 or 6.0.182, the license file in 7.0.98.0 contains both Basic and WPlus license features, so you will not see any disruption in feature availability and operation.
* If you have a base license and you downgrade from 7.0.98.0, 6.0.196.0, 6.0.188.0 or 6.0.182.0, when you downgrade, you lose all WPlus features.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Some references to Wireless LAN Controller WPlus licenses remain in WCS and in the controller CLI and GUI in release 7.0.98.0. However, WLC WPlus license features have been included in the Base license, so you can ignore those references.

---

### Additive Licenses Available for 5500 Series Controllers

You can now purchase licenses to support additional access points on 5500 series controllers. The new additive licenses (for 25, 50, or 100 access points) can be upgraded from all license tiers (12, 25, 50, 100, and 250 access points). The additive licenses are supported through both rehosting and RMAs.

### One-Time Password (OTP) Support

One Time Passwords (OTP) are supported on the Wireless Lan Controller (WLC) using TACACS and RADIUS. In this configuration, the controller acts as a transparent passthrough device. The controller forwards all client requests to the TACACS/RADIUS server without inspecting the client behavior. When using OTP, the client must only establish a single connection to the controller to function properly. The controller currently does not have any intelligence or checks to correct a client that is trying to establish multiple connections.

### **RADIUS Called-station-id and Calling-station-id Attributes**

 **In software releases prior to 6.0, the controller sends uppercase alphabetic characters in the MAC address. In software release 6.0 or later, the controller sends lowercase alphabetic characters in the MAC address for the RADIUS called-station-id and calling-station-id attributes. If you enabled these attributes for 802.1X authentication in previous releases and upgrade to software release 6.0, client authentication fails. Therefore, you must change the MAC addresses to lowercase characters on the RADIUS server before upgrading to software release 6.0.**

### Access Point Groups

You can create up to 50 access point groups for 2100 series controllers and controller network modules and up to 300 access point groups for 4400 series controllers, 500 AP Groups on 5500 Series Controllers, and 192 access point groups for the Cisco WiSM, and the 3750G wireless LAN controller switch.

### Using Access Points in Sniffer Mode

You must disable IP-MAC address binding in order to use an access point in sniffer mode if the access point is joined to a 5500 series controller, a 2100 series controller, or a controller network module running software release 6.0. To disable IP-MAC address binding, enter this command using the controller CLI:  **config network ip-mac-binding disable**.

WLAN 1 must be enabled in order to use an access point in sniffer mode if the access point is joined to a 5500 series controller, a 2100 series controller, or a controller network module running software release 6.0. If WLAN 1 is disabled, the access point cannot send packets.

### Inter-Release Controller Mobility

When controllers in the mobility list are running different software releases (such as 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 6.0), Layer 2 or Layer 3 client roaming is not supported between GD to ED. It is supported only between controllers running the same and GD release such as 6.0 and 4.2.

Guest tunneling works only between controllers running the same software release or between controllers running software release 4.2 and controllers running any later software release (for example, 4.2 to 5.0, 4.2 to 5.1, 4.2 to 5.2, or 4.2 to 6.0). Guest tunneling does not work among controllers running other combinations of software.

### RLDP Limitations in This Release

Rogue Location Discovery Protocol (RLDP) is a controller feature that detects the presence of rogue access points that are connected to your wired network. In this software release, RLDP operates with these limitations:

* RLDP detects rogue access points that are configured for open authentication.
* RLDP detects rogue access points that use a broadcast BSSID (that is, the access point broadcasts its SSID in beacons).
* RLDP detects only rogue access points that are on the same network. In other words, if an access list in the network prevents the sending of RLDP traffic from the rogue access point to the controller, RLDP does not work.
* RLDP does not work on 5-GHz dynamic frequency selection (DFS) channels. However, this works when the managed access point is a monitor mode AP on a DFS channel.

### Internal DHCP Server

When clients use the controller’s internal DHCP server, IP addresses are not preserved across reboots. As a result, multiple clients can be assigned with the same IP address. To resolve any IP address conflicts, clients must release their existing IP address and request a new one.

### Bootloader Menu

When you plug a controller into an AC power source, the bootup script and power-on self-test run to initialize the system. During this time, you can press  **Esc** to display the bootloader Boot Options Menu. The menu options for the 5500 series controllers are different than for other controller platforms.

Bootloader Menu for 5500 Series Controllers

 *Boot Options*

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Refer to the Installation Guide or Quick Start Guide for your controller for more details on running the bootup script and power-on self-test.

---

### Fragmented Pings

Cisco 5500 series controllers do not support fragmented pings on any interface. Similarly, Cisco 4400 series controllers, the Cisco WiSM, and the Catalyst 3750G Integrated Wireless LAN Controller Switch do not support fragmented pings on the AP-manager interface.

### 802.11g Controller and 802.11b Clients

When a controller is configured to allow only 802.11g traffic, 802.11b client devices are able to successfully associate to an access point but cannot pass traffic. When you configure the controller for 802.11g traffic only, disable any channels (such as channel 14 in Japan) that allow associations from 802.11b client devices.

### CAPWAP Problems with Firewalls and ACLs

If you have a firewall or access control list (ACL) between the controller and its access points that allows LWAPP traffic, before upgrading to software release 5.2 or later and CAPWAP, you should allow CAPWAP traffic from the access points to the controller by opening the following destination ports:

* UDP 5246
* UDP 5247

The access points use a random UDP source port to reach these destination ports on the controller. In controller software release 5.2, LWAPP was removed and replaced by CAPWAP, but if you have a new out-of-the-box access point, it could try to use LWAPP to contact the controller before downloading the CAPWAP image from the controller. Once the access point downloads the CAPWAP image from the controller, it uses only CAPWAP to communicate with the controller.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) After 60 seconds of trying to join a controller with CAPWAP, the access point falls back to using LWAPP. If it cannot find a controller using LWAPP within 60 seconds, it tries again to join a controller using CAPWAP. The access point repeats this cycle of switching from CAPWAP to LWAPP and back again every 60 seconds until it joins a controller.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) An access point with the LWAPP recovery image (an access point converted from autonomous mode or an out-of-the-box access point) uses only LWAPP to try to join a controller before downloading the CAPWAP image from the controller.

---

### Messages Appearing Upon Controller Bootup

Several messages might flood the message logs when the controller boots up. These messages appear because of a failure to read or delete several different configuration files. These are low-severity messages that can safely be ignored. They do not affect controller functionality. These are some examples:

Mar 18 16:05:56.753 osapi\_file.c:274 OSAPI-5-FILE\_DEL\_FAILED: Failed to delete the file : sshpmInitParms.cfg. file removal failed.

-Process: Name:fp\_main\_task, Id:11ca7618

Mar 18 16:05:56.753 osapi\_file.c:274 OSAPI-5-FILE\_DEL\_FAILED: Failed to delete the file : bcastInitParms.cfg. file removal failed.

-Process: Name:fp\_main\_task, Id:11ca7618

### Web Authentication Redirects

The controller supports web authentication redirects only to HTTP (HTTP over TCP) servers. It does not support web authentication redirects to HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) servers.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) For 5500 series controllers, 2100 series controllers, and controller network modules, you must configure a preauthentication access control list (ACL) on the WLAN for the external web server and then choose this ACL as the WLAN preauthentication ACL under Security Policies > Web Policy on the WLANs > Edit page.

---

### Cisco 1250 Series Access Points and Cisco 7920 IP Phones

Cisco 1250 series access points are not supported for use with the Cisco 7920 IP phone. They can, however, be used with the Cisco 7921 and 7925 IP phones.

### Crash Files for 1250 Series Access Points

The 1250 series access points may contain a bootloader older than version 12.4(10b)JA. Units with old bootloaders do not generate a crash log when a crash occurs. The crash log is disabled so that a crash does not corrupt the flash file system. Units with bootloader versions 12.4(10b)JA or later generate a crash log if the access point is associated to a controller running software release 4.2.112.0 or later.

New 1250 series access points shipped from the factory contain new bootloader images, which fix the flash file system after it is corrupted during a crash (without losing files). This new bootloader automatically sets a new CRASH\_LOG environment variable to "yes," which enables a crash log to be generated following a crash but only on controllers running software release 4.2.112.0 or later. Therefore, no user configuration is needed to enable a crash log on new 1250 series access points shipped from the factory.

These examples show the output from the CLI commands (in bold) that you use to check the bootloader version on lightweight and autonomous 1250 series access points:

Commands entered on the controller CLI:

 **debug ap enable** AP001b.d513.1754

 **debug ap command "show version | include BOOTLDR"** AP001b.d513.1754

Thu Apr 23 09:31:38 2009: AP001b.d513.1754: BOOTLDR: C1250 Boot Loader

(C1250-BOOT-M) Version 12.4(10b)JA, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Command entered on the access point CLI:

 **show version | include BOOTLDR**

BOOTLDR: C1250 Boot Loader (C1250-BOOT-M) Version 12.4(10b)JA, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

### Configuration File Stored in XML

In controller software release 4.2.61.0 and later, the controller’s bootup configuration file is stored in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) format rather than in binary format. When you upgrade a controller to 4.2.61.0 or a later software release, the binary configuration file is migrated and converted to XML.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You cannot download a binary configuration file onto a controller running software release 7.0.98.0. Also, do not attempt to make changes to the configuration file. If you do so and then download the file to a controller, the controller displays a cyclic redundancy checksum (CRC) error while it is rebooting and returns the configuration parameters to their default values.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You cannot modify the configuration files for 2000, 4000, and 4100 series controllers. The ability to modify configuration files is available in controller software release 5.2 or later, and these controllers support only earlier software releases (up to the 4.2 release for 2000 series controllers and up to the 3.2 release for 4000 and 4100 series controllers).

---

### LWAPP Mode Changes

When you upgrade to controller software release 5.0.148.0 or later, the LWAPP mode changes to Layer 3 if it was previously configured for Layer 2.

If you downgrade from controller software release 7.0.98.0, 6.0.196.0, 6.0.188.0, 5.2.178.0, 5.2.157.0, 5.1.151.0, or 5.0.148.0 to 4.2.61.0 or an earlier release, the LWAPP mode changes from Layer 3 to Layer 2. Access points might not join the controller, and you must manually reset the controller to Layer 3 to resolve this issue.

### WLC GARP Behavior

The dynamic interface gateway fails first and controller receives the GARP for the dynamic interface from the switch and sends it accordingly to the client. After the controller sends out the GARP, the getway for the ap manager fails and this packet is dropped. The solution for this problem is as follows:

* Configure the ap-manager on a lower vlan so that the controller gets the GARP for ap-manager first, and then updates the ARP cache and sends out the GARPs that comes successively for the dynamic interface gateways through the new gateway. This way the GARPs do not get dropped and the clients does not disconnect.
* Stack-mac persistent timer 0 command on stack SW. If it is set to 0, mac address of stack SW is never changed to another one, so that the controller need not update the ARP table.

### Access Points Send Multicast and Management Frames at Highest Basic Rate

Access points running recent Cisco IOS versions transmit multicast frames at the highest configured basic rate and management frames at lowest basic mandatory rates, which can cause reliability problems. Access points running LWAPP or autonomous Cisco IOS should transmit multicast and management frames at the lowest configured basic rate. Such behavior is necessary to provide good coverage at the cell’s edge, especially for unacknowledged multicast transmissions where multicast wireless transmissions may fail to be received.

Because multicast frames are not retransmitted at the MAC layer, clients at the edge of the cell may fail to receive them successfully. If reliable reception is a goal, then multicast frames should be transmitted at a low data rate. If support for high data rate multicast frames is required, then it may be useful to shrink the cell size and disable all lower data rates.

Depending on your specific requirements, you can take the following action:

* If you need to transmit multicast data with the greatest reliability and if there is no need for great multicast bandwidth, then configure a single basic rate, one that is low enough to reach the edges of the wireless cells.
* If you need to transmit multicast data at a certain data rate in order to achieve a certain throughput, then configure that rate as the highest basic rate. You can also set a lower basic rate for coverage of nonmulticast clients.

### Disabling Radio Bands

The controller disables the radio bands that are not permitted by the configured country of operation (CSCsi48220).

### 802.11a Channels 120, 124, and 128 Disabled

802.11a channels 120, 124, and 128 are disabled to achieve compliance with draft EN 301 893 version 1.5.1 on the following -E regulatory domain products: AP1131AG, AP1242AG, and AP1252AG.

### Impact of External Antenna Gain on Transmit Power

In controller software release 4.2 or later, external antenna gain is factored into the maximum transmit power of the access point. Therefore, when you upgrade from an earlier software release to 4.2 or later, you might see a decrease in transmit power output.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The Transmit Power level can range between -10 dBM to 30 dBM.

---

### Supporting Oversized Access Point Images

Controller software release 4.2 or later allows you to upgrade to an oversized access point image by deleting the recovery image to create sufficient space. This feature affects only access points with 8 MB of flash (the 1100, 1200, and 1310 series access points). All newer access points have a larger flash size than 8 MB.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) As of August 2007, there are no oversized access point images, but as new features are added, the access point image size will continue to grow.

---

The recovery image provides a backup image that can be used if an access point power-cycles during an image upgrade. The best way to avoid the need for access point recovery is to prevent an access point from power-cycling during a system upgrade. If a power-cycle occurs during an upgrade to an oversized access point image, you can recover the access point using the TFTP recovery procedure.

To recover the access point using the TFTP recovery procedure, follow these steps:

---

 **Step 1**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Download the required recovery image from Cisco.com (c1100-rcvk9w8-mx, c1200-rcvk9w8-mx, or c1310-rcvk9w8-mx) and install it in the root directory of your TFTP server.

**Step 2**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Connect the TFTP server to the same subnet as the target access point and power-cycle the access point. The access point boots from the TFTP image and then joins the controller to download the oversized access point image and complete the upgrade procedure.

**Step 3**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) After the access point has been recovered, you may remove the TFTP server.

---

### Multicast Queue Depth

The multicast queue depth is 512 packets on all controller platforms. However, the following message might appear on 2106 controllers: “Rx Multicast Queue is full on Controller.” This message does not appear on 4400 series controllers because the 4400 NPU filters ARP packets while all forwarding (multicast or otherwise) and multicast replication are done in the software on the 2106.

This message appears when too many multicast messages are sent to the CPU. In controller software releases prior to 5.1, multicast, CDP, and ARP packets share the same queue. However, in software releases 5.1 and later, these packets are separated into different queues. There are currently no controller commands that can be entered to determine if the multicast receive queue is full. When the queue is full, some packets are randomly discarded.

### MAC Filtering for WGB Wired Clients

Controller software release 4.1.178.0 or later enables you to configure a MAC-filtering IP address for a workgroup bridge (WGB) wired client to allow passive WGB wired clients, such as terminal servers or printers with static IP addresses, to be added and remain in the controller’s client table while the WGB is associated to a controller in the mobility group. This feature, activated by the  **config macfilter ipaddress**  *MAC\_address IP\_address*  CLI command, can be used with any passive device that does not initiate any traffic but waits for another device to start communication.

This feature allows the controller to learn the IP address of a passive WGB wired client when the WGB sends an IAPP message to the controller that contains only the WGB wired client’s MAC address. Upon receiving this message from the WGB, the controller checks the local MAC filter list (or the anchor controller’s MAC filter list if the WGB has roamed) for the client’s MAC address. If an entry is found and it contains an IP address for the client, the controller adds the client to the controller’s client table.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Unlike the existing MAC filtering feature for wireless clients, you are not required to enable MAC filtering on the WLAN for WGB wired clients.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) WGB wired clients using MAC filtering do not need to obtain an IP address through DHCP to be added to the controller’s client table.

---

### CKIP Not Supported with Dynamic WEP

In controller software release 4.1.185.0 or later, CKIP is supported for use only with static WEP. It is not supported for use with dynamic WEP. Therefore, a wireless client that is configured to use CKIP with dynamic WEP is unable to associate to a wireless LAN that is configured for CKIP. We recommend that you use either dynamic WEP without CKIP (which is less secure) or WPA/WPA2 with TKIP or AES (which are more secure).

### Setting the Date and Time on the Controller

Cisco Aironet lightweight access points do not connect to the controller if the date and time are not set properly. Set the current date and time on the controller before allowing the access points to connect to it.

### Synchronizing the Controller and Location Appliance

For controller software release 4.2 or later, if a location appliance (release 3.1 or later) is installed on your network, the time zone must be set on the controller to ensure proper synchronization between the two systems. Also, we highly recommend that the time be set for networks that do not have location appliances. Refer to Chapter 4 of the  *Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Configuration Guide, Release 7.0,*  for instructions for setting the time and date on the controller.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The time zone can be different for the controller and the location appliance, but the time zone delta must be configured accordingly, based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

---

### FCC DFS Support on 1130 Series Access Points

Federal Communications Commission (FCC) dynamic frequency selection (DFS) is supported only on 1130 series access points in the United States, Canada, and the Philippines that have a new FCC ID. Access points use DFS to detect radar signals such as military and weather sources and then switch channels to avoid interfering with them. 1130 series access points with FCC DFS support have an FCC ID  *LDK102054E* sticker. 1130 series access points without FCC DFS support have an  *LDK102054* (no  *E* suffix) sticker. 1130 series access points that are operating in the United States, Canada, or the Philippines; have an FCC ID  *E* sticker; and are running the 4.1.171.0 software release or later can use channels 100 through 140 in the UNII-2 band.

### Inaccurate Transmit Power Display

After you change the position of the 802.11a radio antenna for a lightweight 1200 or 1230 series access point, the power setting is not updated in the controller GUI and CLI. Regardless of the user display, the internal data is updated, and the transmit power output is changed accordingly. To see the correct transmit power display values, reboot the access point after changing the antenna’s position. (CSCsf02280)

### Setting the Retransmit Timeout Value for TACACS+ Servers

We recommend that the retransmit timeout value for TACACS+ authentication, authorization, and accounting servers be increased if you experience repeated reauthentication attempts or the controller falls back to the backup server when the primary server is active and reachable. The default retransmit timeout value is 2 seconds and can be increased to a maximum of 30 seconds.

### Configuring an Access Point’s Prestandard Power Setting

An access point can be powered by a Cisco prestandard 15-watt switch with Power over Ethernet (PoE) by entering this command:

 **config ap power pre-standard** { **enable** |  **disable** } { **all** |  *Cisco\_AP* }

A Cisco prestandard 15-watt switch does not support intelligent power management (IPM) but does have sufficient power for a standard access point. The following Cisco prestandard 15-watt switches are available:

* AIR-WLC2106-K9
* WS-C3550, WS-C3560, WS-C3750
* C1880
* 2600, 2610, 2611, 2621, 2650, 2651
* 2610XM, 2611XM, 2621XM, 2650XM, 2651XM, 2691
* 2811, 2821, 2851
* 3631-telco, 3620, 3640, 3660
* 3725, 3745
* 3825, 3845

The  **enable** version of this command is required for full functionality when the access point is powered by a Cisco prestandard 15-watt switch. It is safe to use if the access point is powered by either an IPM switch or a power injector or if the access point is not using one of the 15-watt switches listed above.

You might need this command if your radio operational status is “Down” when you expect it to be “Up.” Enter the  **show msglog** command to look for this error message, which indicates a PoE problem:

Apr 13 09:08:24.986 spam\_lrad.c:2262 LWAPP-3-MSGTAG041: AP 00:14:f1:af:f3:40 is unable to verify sufficient in-line power. Radio slot 0 disabled.

### Controller Functions that Require a Reboot

After you perform these functions on the controller, you must reboot the controller in order for them to take effect:

* Enable or disable link aggregation (LAG)
* Enable a feature that is dependent on certificates (such as HTTPS and web authentication)
* Install a license, change the license feature set, or change the priority of an AP-count evaluation license on a 5500 series controller

### 2106 Controller LEDs

The 2106 controller’s Status LED and AP LED do not flash amber when software is being uploaded to the controller or downloaded to an access point, respectively.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Some versions of the *Cisco 2106 Wireless LAN Controller Quick Start Guide* might incorrectly state that these LEDs flash amber during a software upload or download.

---

### Rate-Limiting on the Controller

Rate-limiting is applicable to all traffic destined to the CPU from either direction (wireless or wired). We recommend that you always run the controller with the default  **config advanced rate enable** command in effect in order to rate-limit traffic to the controller and protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. You can use the  **config advanced rate disable** command to stop rate-limiting of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo responses for testing purposes. However, we recommend that you reapply the  **config advanced rate enable** command after testing is complete.

### Pings Supported to the Management Interface of the Controller

Controller software release 4.1.185.0 or later is designed to support ICMP pings to the management interface either from a wireless client or a wired host. ICMP pings to other interfaces configured on the controller are not supported.

### Pinging from a Network Device to a Controller Dynamic Interface

Pinging from a network device to a controller dynamic interface may not work in some configurations. When pinging does operate successfully, the controller places Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic in a low-priority queue, and the reply to ping is on best effort. Pinging does not pose a security threat to the network. The controller rate limits any traffic to the CPU, and flooding the controller is prevented. Clients on the WLAN associated with the interface pass traffic normally.

### GLBP Support

This version of Controller software release 7.0.98.0 is compatible with the Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP).

### 4400 Series Controllers Do Not Forward Subnet Broadcasts through the Guest Tunnel

As designed, 4400 series controllers do not forward IP subnet broadcasts from the wired network to wireless clients across the EoIP guest tunnel.

### Connecting 1100 and 1300 Series Access Points

You must install software release 4.0.179.8 or later on the controller before connecting 1100 and 1300 series access points to the controller.

### Preventing Clients from Accessing the Management Network on a Controller

To prevent or block a wired or wireless client from accessing the management network on a controller (from the wireless client dynamic interface or VLAN), the network administrator should ensure that there is no route through which to reach the controller from the dynamic interface or use a firewall between the client dynamic interface and the management network.

### Voice Wireless LAN Configuration

Cisco recommends that aggressive load balancing always be turned off either through the controller GUI or CLI in any wireless network that is supporting voice, regardless of vendor. When aggressive load balancing is turned on, voice clients can hear an audible artifact when roaming, and the handset is refused at its first reassociation attempt.

### Enabling/Disabling Band Selection and Client Load Balancing

It is not possible to enable or disable band selection and client load balancing globally through the controller GUI or CLI. You can, however, enable or disable band selection and client load balancing for a particular WLAN. Band selection and client load balancing is enabled globally by default.

### Changing the IOS LWAPP Access Point Password

Cisco IOS Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) access points have a default password of Cisco, and the prestage configuration for LWAPP access points is disabled by default. To enable it, you must configure the access point with a new username and password when it joins the controller. Enter this command using the controller CLI to push a new username and password to the access point:

config ap mgmtuser add user\_id password password {Cisco\_AP | all}

* The Cisco\_AP parameter configures the username and password on the specified access point.
* The all parameter configures the username and password on all the access points registered to the controller.

The password pushed from the controller is configured as “enable password” on the access point.

There are some cases where the prestage configuration for LWAPP access points is disabled and the access point displays the following error message when the CLI commands are applied:

“ERROR!!! Command is disabled.”

For more information, refer to Upgrading Autonomous Cisco Aironet Access Points to Lightweight Mode.

### Exclusion List Client Feature

If a client is not able to connect to an access point, and the security policy for the WLAN and client are correct, the client has probably been disabled. In the controller GUI, you can view the client’s status on the Monitor > Summary page under Client Summary. If the client is disabled, click Remove to clear the disabled state for that client. The client automatically comes back and, if necessary, reattempts authentication.

Automatic disabling happens as a result of too many failed authentications. Clients disabled due to failed authorization do not appear on the permanent disable display. This display is only for those MACs that are set as permanently disabled by the administrator.

### RADIUS Servers and the Management VLAN

If a RADIUS server is on a directly connected subnet (with respect to the controller), then that subnet must be the management VLAN subnet.

### RADIUS Servers

This product has been tested with CiscoSecure ACS 4.2 and later and works with any RFC-compliant RADIUS server.

### Management Usernames and Local Netuser Names

Management usernames and local netuser names must be unique because they are stored in the same database. That is, you cannot assign the same name to a management user and a local netuser.

### Using the Backup Image

The controller bootloader stores a copy of the active primary image and the backup image. If the primary image becomes corrupted, you can use the bootloader to boot with the backup image.

With the backup image stored before rebooting, be sure to choose Option 2: Run Backup Image from the boot menu to boot from the backup image. Then, upgrade with a known working image and reboot the controller.

### Home Page Retains Web Authentication Login with IE 5.x

Because of a caching problem in the Internet Explorer 5.x browser, the home page retains the web authentication login. To correct this problem, clear the history or upgrade your workstation to Internet Explorer 6.x.

### Ad-Hoc Rogue Containment

Client card implementations may mitigate the effectiveness of ad-hoc containment.

### Changing the Default Values of SNMP Community Strings

The controller has commonly known default values of “public” and “private” for the read-only and read-write SNMP community strings. Using these standard values presents a security risk. Therefore, Cisco strongly advises that you change these values. Refer to the  *Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Configuration Guide, Release 7.0,*  for configuration instructions.

### Changing the Default Values for SNMP v3 Users

The controller uses a default value of “default” for the username, authentication password, and privacy password for SNMP v3 users. Using these standard values presents a security risk. Therefore, Cisco strongly advises that you change these values. Refer to the  *Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Configuration Guide, Release 7.0,*  for configuration instructions.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) SNMP v3 is time sensitive. Make sure that you have configured the correct time and time zone on your controller.

---

### DirectStream Feature Is Not Supported With WGB

The DirectStream feature from the controller does not work for clients behind workgroup bridges and the stream is denied. This feature is not supported in 7.0 release.

### Controller does not Support Transmitting Jumbo Frames

The controller does not support transmitting jumbo frames. To avoid having the WLC transmit CAPWAP packets to the AP that necessitates fragmentation and reassembly, reduces the MTU/MSS on the client side. For example, the TCP MSS Adjust feature can be leveraged here.

### Features Not Supported on 2100 Series Controllers

This hardware feature is not supported on 2100 series controllers:

* Service port (separate out-of-band management 10/100-Mbps Ethernet interface)

These software features are not supported on 2100 series controllers:

* VPN termination (such as IPsec and L2TP)
* VPN passthrough option

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You can replicate this functionality on a 2100 series controller by creating an open WLAN using an ACL.

---

* Termination of guest controller tunnels (origination of guest controller tunnels is supported)
* External web authentication web server list
* Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
* Port mirroring
* AppleTalk
* QoS per-user bandwidth contracts
* IPv6 pass-through
* Link aggregation (LAG)
* Multicast-unicast mode

### Features Not Supported on 5500 Series Controllers

These software features are not supported on 5500 series controllers:

* Static AP-manager interface

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) For 5500 series controllers, you are not required to configure an AP-manager interface. The management interface acts like an AP-manager interface by default, and the access points can join on this interface.

---

* Asymmetric mobility tunneling
* Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
* Port mirroring
* Layer 2 access control list (ACL) support
* VPN termination (such as IPsec and L2TP)
* VPN passthrough option

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You can replicate this functionality on a 5500 series controller by creating an open WLAN using an ACL.

---

* Configuration of 802.3 bridging, AppleTalk, and Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The 5500 series controllers bridge these packets by default. If desired, you can use ACLs to block the bridging of these protocols.

---

### Some Clients See Only 64 Access Point MAC Addresses (BSSIDs) at a Time

In a crowded RF environment, clients may not be able to detect the desired SSID because of internal table limitations. Sometimes disabling and then enabling the client interface forces a rescan. Your RF environment needs to be controlled. Cisco UWN rogue access point detection and containment can help you to enforce RF policies in your buildings and campuses.

### 2106 Image Not Supported for 3504 Controllers

The 2106 controller image is supported for use with only 2100 series controllers. Do not install the 2106 image on a 3504 controller. Otherwise, errors may occur. Install only the 3504 image on a 3504 controller.

### Running a 3504 Image on a 2106 Series Controller

It is possible to run a 3504 controller image on a 2106 series controller, but Cisco Aironet 1130, 1200, and 1240 series access points will not be able to connect to the controller.

### Upgrading External Web Authentication

When upgrading a controller from operating system release 2.0 or 2.2.127.4 to release 3.2.116.21 or later, update the external web authentication configuration as follows:

 **1.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) For 5500 series controllers, 2100 series controllers, and controller network modules, you must configure a preauthentication access control list (ACL) on the WLAN for the external web server and then choose this ACL as the WLAN preauthentication ACL under  **Security Policies** >  **Web Policy** on the WLANs > Edit page.

 **2.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) For 4400 series controllers and the Cisco WiSM, instead of using a preauthentication ACL, the network manager must configure the external web server IP address using this command:

 **config custom-web ext-webserver add index IP-address**

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) IP-address is the address of any web server that performs external web authentication.

---

 **3.**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The network manager must use the new login\_template shown here:

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Make sure to format the script to avoid any extra characters or spaces before using the web authentication template.

### Switch Port and Controller Port

When the port status on the controller changes, the switch status does not get changed. This is a known issue. For example, when the controller port goes down, the switch port is still in administrable state. This has been resolved in Cisco 5500 Series Controllers.

### Issues With **mac-address** CLI for Unified and Autonomous Access Points

The unified and autonomous access point do not support the  **mac-address** command for the wireless interfaces. When invoked, the command executes, but can cause the access point to fail.

### Default A-MPDU settings

By default, Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit (A-MPDU) is enabled for priority level 0, 4 and 5 and the rest are disabled. In releases prior to 6.0 release, only priority 0 was enabled by default. The video performance is enhanced when priorities 4 and 5 are enabled for A-MPDU aggregation.

## Important Notes for Controllers and Mesh Access Points

This section describes important information about controllers and mesh access points.

### New Features

The following new features are available in controller software release 7.0.98.0.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) See the *Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Configuration Guide, Release 7.0*, for more details and configuration instructions.

---

### Backhaul Channel Deselection on Serial Backhaul Access Point

This feature enables you to configure a set of channels available to be assigned for the serial backhaul RAPs/MAPs. Normally, channels are selected by the user for RAPs, and the MAPs automatically tune to RAP channels (for AP1522 and AP1522PS) or select channels automatically (AP1524SB and AP1523CV). With the 7.0.98.0 release, there is a connect between the DCA list and serial backhaul mesh access points, only if someone uses (enables) this feature.

### Serial Backhaul Launch for Rest of the World (ROW)

From software release 7.0.98.0 release or later releases, new 1524 SKUs are released, with both 802.11a radio units that supports an entire 5-GHz band from 4.9-GHz to 5-GHz and radios can operate in UNII-2 (5.25 - 5.35-GHz), UNII-2 plus (5.47 - 5.725-GHz), and upper ISM (5.725 - 5.850-GHz) bands.

The public safety band (4.94 to 4.99 GHz) is not supported for backhaul and client access.

With the expansion of the channel set, DFS-enabled channels, radar detection, and automatic channel reassignment in case of radar detection on RAP/MAPs are also supported. When there is a channel change, the change is propagated to the corresponding parent/child access point (if applicable) so that the change is synchronized between the parent and child and there is no link downtime. For example, if radar is detected on the uplink radio of a child access point, the parent is informed so that it can change the channel of the downlink radio. The parent informs the child about the channel change, so that the child access point can set the new channel on its uplink radio and does not have to scan again to rejoin the parent on the new channel.

### Universal Client Access on Serial Backhaul Access Points

The serial backhaul access point consists of three radio slots. Radios in slot 0 operate in a 2.4-GHz band and are used for client access. The downlink and uplink radios operate in a 5-GHz band and are primarily used for backhaul. With the Universal Client Access feature, client access is allowed over slot 1 radios with the extended universal client access feature and client access is also allowed over slot 2 radios.

The two 802.11a backhaul radios use the same MAC address. There may be instances where the same WLAN maps to the same BSSID on more than one slot.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) This feature is intended only for WGB clients and not for typical Wireless clients.

---

By default, client access is disabled over both the backhaul radios.

### Cable Modem Serial Access from Access Point

This feature enables you to execute commands to the cable modem from the privileged mode of the CLI. This command takes a text string and sends it to the cable modem UART interface. The Cable modem interprets the text string as one of its own CLI commands. The response is captured and displayed to the IOS console. Up to 9600 characters are displayed from the cable modem. Any text beyond the 9600 characters is truncated. The modem CLI commands can be used on Mesh APs that have devices connected to the UART port.

### Wireless Client Support for WGB

A Workgroup Bridge (WGB) is a small standalone unit that can provide a wireless infrastructure connection for Ethernet-enabled devices. Devices that do not have a wireless client adapter to connect to the wireless network can be connected to the WGB through the Ethernet port. The WGB is associated with the root AP through the wireless interface. Thus, wired clients get access to the wireless network.

In the current architecture, while an autonomous AP functions as a workgroup bridge, only one radio interface is used for controller connectivity, an Ethernet interface is used for wired client connectivity, and another radio interface is used for wireless client connectivity. In a practical scenario, dot11radio 1 (5 GHz) can be used to connect to the controller (using a mesh infrastructure), an Ethernet interface can be used for wired clients, and dot11radio 0 (2.4 GHz) can be used for wireless client connectivity. This scenario can improve the serviceability of a workgroup bridge without any extra cost. Depending on your network requirements, dot11radio 1 or dot11radio 0 can be used for client association or controller connectivity.

With the 7.0.98.0 release, the wireless clients on the second radio of the WGB are not dissociated by the WGB when it loses its uplink to a wireless infrastructure or in a roaming scenario. Access points with two radios certainly gives better advantage because one radio can be used for client access and the other radio can be used for accessing the access points. Also, wireless clients on the second radio do not get disassociated by the WGB when it loses its uplink or in a roaming scenario. In this scenario, you must configure one radio as Root (radio role) and the second radio as WGB (radio role). All wireless clients connecting to the radio with role Root will belong to the same WLAN and the same VLAN which the WGB joins on the radio configured as role WGB.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If one radio is configured as a WGB, then the second radio cannot be a WGB or a Repeater.

---

### Separation of Ethernet Clients Behind WGB

This feature provides a way for the Administrator to have wired clients behind a WGB in different VLANS. This feature also provides the QoS support to prioritize packets from WGB wired clients in the Mesh Backhaul based on DSCP/dot1p values, when a WGB is associated to a Mesh Access Point. Multicast support is provided for WGB wired VLAN clients by implementing IGMP Snooping in the Workgroup-Bridge. For using this feature, the WGB must use a release later than 12.4(21a)JA1, which has support for VLAN separation. This feature does not support downstream broadcasting of per-VLAN. However, you can replicate broadcast packets to all VLANS behind the Workgroup-bridge using the CLI.

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) We recommend that you enable the IGMP feature for this feature to work.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Broadcasts received to a controller form a VLAN other than the VLAN of the WGB will not work.

---

![note.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![blank.gif](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Dynamic interfaces should be configured on the Controllers for all the VLANs configured in the WGB and the switch connecting the WGB. Layer-2 multicast is not supported for WGB Ethernet clients. The same native VLAN should be configured in the Controller, Workgroup-Bridge, and the switch connecting the Workgroup-Bridge.

---

### Features Not Supported on Mesh Networks

The following controller features are  **not** supported on mesh networks:

* Multi-country support
* Load-based CAC (Mesh networks support only bandwidth-based, or static, CAC)
* High availability (fast heartbeat and primary discovery join timer)
* EAP-FASTv1 and 802.1X authentication
* Access point join priority (Mesh access points have a fixed priority.)
* Locally significant certificate
* Location-based services
