This document describes multiple vulnerabilities in various Oracle products addressed in the October 2010 Critical Patch Update. While it mentions CVE identifiers are associated with the vulnerabilities, it does not provide specific details for each CVE. The document provides general information about the types of vulnerabilities found.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:** Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities exist in various Oracle products and components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Remote execution of arbitrary code.
*   Information disclosure.
*   Denial of service.
*  Vulnerabilities include a memory initialization issue in the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Execution of arbitrary code or commands.
*   Exposure of sensitive information.
*   Denial of service.
*   An attacker who compromises an Oracle database can access sensitive information.
*   Remote exploitation of the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control may be done by an unauthenticated attacker by enticing the user to access a specially crafted HTML file

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Vulnerable components may be accessible to unauthenticated, remote attackers.
*  A specially crafted HTML file, likely on a website controlled by the attacker, can be used to exploit the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Remote network access.
* For the Siebel Option Pack vulnerability, the attacker needs to entice a user to access a malicious HTML file.
* For some vulnerabilities, no authentication is required. However, specific exploitation of Siebel components requires some form of authentication in a traditional network access.
