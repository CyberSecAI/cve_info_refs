Exploit Title: Crystal Reports Viewer 12.0.0.549 - 'PrintControl.dll' ActiveX
CVE: CVE-2010-2590
Vulnerable Product: Crystal Reports Viewer 12.0.0.549
Vulnerable Component: PrintControl.dll ActiveX Control
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `ServerResourceVersion` method of the `PrintControl.dll` ActiveX control. It appears that an overly long string can be passed to this method, leading to a buffer overflow.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow.
Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite parts of memory, including the return address, to redirect execution flow to a shellcode, achieving code execution on the victim's machine.
Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTML page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control and calls the `ServerResourceVersion` method with a crafted string payload.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host the malicious HTML page on a server (or send it via email or other means). The victim needs to open the crafted HTML page using Internet Explorer which has the vulnerable ActiveX control enabled.
Additional information: The exploit code provided uses a heap spray technique to increase reliability. The shellcode provided is a basic payload that executes `calc.exe`.
