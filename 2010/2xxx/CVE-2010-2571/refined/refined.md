The provided content relates to CVE-2010-2571.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Publisher opens Publisher files, specifically how it parses Publisher 97 format files. An invalid index into an array within the `pubconv.dll` library during the parsing process leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to an invalid array index when parsing specially crafted Publisher files.
- Improper handling of Publisher 97 file format.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
- Ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with administrative rights are at higher risk.

**Attack vectors:**
- E-mail attachments: Attackers can send specially crafted Publisher files as email attachments.
- Web-based attacks: Attackers can host malicious Publisher files on websites.
- Compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content can also be used to host malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to create a specially crafted Publisher file.
- They need to convince a user to open the malicious file, either via email, a malicious link, or a compromised website.
- No specific privileges or special network access is required beyond this social engineering aspect.
