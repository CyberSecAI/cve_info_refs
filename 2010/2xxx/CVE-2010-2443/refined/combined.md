# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF 4.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.2-r1"

```

All libTIFF 3.9 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.9.5-r2"

```

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: libtiff4

Any application using libtiff will segfault because of a null dereference when opening the attached TIFF-file. I seem to be missing some debug symbols for libtiff4 (I couldn't find installation package for them), but here's the not-too-helpful valgrind output I got:

==5908== Process terminating with default action of signal 11 (SIGSEGV)

==5908== Access not within mapped region at address 0x0

==5908== at 0x7CB1ED0: ??? (in /usr/lib/libtiff.so.4.3.2)

==5908== by 0x807C6F1: eog\_image\_load (eog-image.c:1056)

I am initially marking this as a security vulnerability since the file makes all the nautilus etc crash too which is bit annoying even though it does not seem to allow code execution. Remove the security vuln tag if this is not considered as security issue.

Do you have any info on this?  I don't see anything obviously related
in changelog.  TIFFExtractData itself and all its uses seem unchanged
for years.

This is NULL deref.  Another Sauli's test case shows that similar
problem can occur with NULL td_stripbytecount few lines below
td_stripoffset case addressed in upstream patch.

Right, not related to what CVE-2010-2065 was assigned to.

IIRC, Sauli's file only demonstrates OOB read.  Upstream bug:
<http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2216>

> 4.  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2207> ("tif_getimage

CVE-2010-2233 was assigned to this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Download RAW [message](?l=oss-security&m=127781315415896&q=mbox) or [body](?l=oss-security&m=127781315415896&q=raw)]

On request, I'm re-posting the issues which I think actually deserve
CVE ids.  The following three issues reliably crash libtiff in the
general case of doing initial parsing to view an image:

1.  Out-of-bounds read in TIFFExtractData() may result in application
crash.  Revision 1.92.2.9 of libtiff/tif_dirread.c added code for
ensuring valid type information for each TIFF directory entry.  Prior
to this fix, unknown tag types would result in an out-of-bounds array
index in TIFFExtractData() on any code path using this macro.

Ubuntu security backported this fix as
debian/patches/fix-unknown-tags.patch because in discussion with them,
I identified the patch as a fix for this issue.  I discovered this
issue and disclosed it to iDefense Labs along with the SubjectDistance
overflow, but they did not share details of this with downstream
vendors (which was the source of my confusion surrounding knowledge of
the issue).  It seems that it was actually fixed in 3.9.4
inadvertently as a result of fixing another unrelated problem, and my
description of it here can be considered the first disclosure of the
issue, which affects all versions 3.x <= 3.9.2.

2.  A NULL pointer derefrence in TIFFVGetField() may result in
application crash
([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/tiff/+bug/589145](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/%2Bsource/tiff/%2Bbug/589145)).
The fix for this issue was combined with the fix for CVE-2010-2065,
but it has been confirmed to be a separate issue.  Reported by Sauli
Pahlman.

3.  Out-of-bounds read in TIFFRGBAImageGet() due to reading past the
bounds of a buffer
([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tiff/+bug/591605](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tiff/%2Bbug/591605)) may lead
to application crash.  Reported by Sauli Pahlman.

The remainder of the issues have already been assigned CVEs or require
additional user assistance to trigger, as as such can be considered
stability issues rather than security.

Thanks,
Dan
