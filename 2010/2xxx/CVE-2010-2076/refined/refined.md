{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-2076",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Apache CXF handles Document Type Declarations (DTDs) in XML messages, specifically in HTTP bindings, which do not enforce the SOAP 1.1 restriction against DTDs. This allows processing of the DTD by the StAX parser before the error is reported. The default entity resolver in CXF makes the application susceptible to attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of enforcement of the SOAP 1.1 specification that prohibits DTDs in SOAP messages.",
        "Failure to prevent processing of DTDs in HTTP bindings.",
        "Default entity resolver allows access to arbitrary files and resources.",
        "Insufficient checks against nested entity definitions leading to potential Denial of Service (DoS)."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially:\n\n*   Read arbitrary files on the server's file system.\n*   Scan for the presence of files or network resources accessible to the server.\n*   Retrieve content of arbitrary files by including their content in the request via external entity declarations.\n*   Execute arbitrary HTTP GET requests from the server, potentially targeting other systems in the network.\n*   Carry out Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by exploiting deeply nested entity definitions that cause excessive CPU and memory consumption.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vectors involve sending specially crafted XML messages that include DTDs to a CXF service. The messages can be sent via HTTP bindings.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send XML messages to a vulnerable CXF service. This requires knowledge of the service's endpoints. For certain attacks such as file existence checks and DoS, the attacker doesn't need detailed knowledge of the specific service or message format."
