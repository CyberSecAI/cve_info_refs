- **Vulnerability:** Weak default hashing algorithm in Wind River Systems VxWorks standard authentication API (loginLib). The hashing algorithm is susceptible to collisions.
- **Root Cause:** The default hashing algorithm used in the standard authentication API (loginDefaultEncrypt()) is susceptible to collisions.
- **Weakness:** Use of a weak hashing algorithm.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker with a known username and access to a service (telnet, rlogin or FTP) that uses the standard authentication API.
- **Impact:** An attacker can brute force a password by guessing a string that produces the same hash as a legitimate password and gain access to the relevant service as the known user.
- **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to know a valid username and have network access to a service using the vulnerable authentication API (e.g., telnet, rlogin, FTP).
- **Solution:**
  -  Vendors using VxWorks should not use the default hashing algorithm in the standard authentication API (loginDefaultEncrypt()).
  -  A trusted authentication API should be used instead, installed via the `loginEncryptInstall()` loginLib hook.
  -  Set `LOGIN_USER_NAME` and `LOGIN_USER_PASSWORD` project parameters to empty strings to avoid registering default credentials with the vulnerable encryption routine.
  -  Install a custom encryption routine using `loginEncryptInstall()`. Example code is provided using SHA-512 or SHA-256 (depending on VxWorks version).
- **Affected Vendors:** Ericsson, Polycom, Wind River Systems, Inc.
- **Unaffected Vendors:** Canon, EMC Corporation, Ricoh Company Ltd., Rockwell Automation, Siemens, amx
