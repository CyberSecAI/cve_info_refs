The provided content is related to CVE-2010-2502.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability within the Splunk Web component. This vulnerability exists in two forms:

1.  **Unauthenticated directory traversal:**  Splunk Web is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks without requiring authentication.
2.  **Authenticated directory traversal via upload:** Splunk Web is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks through its upload interface, requiring an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to navigate the file system beyond the intended web root directory.
*   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** In one of the forms, the directory traversal can be exploited without authentication.
*   **Unsanitized input:** In the upload form, directory traversal can occur if the input is not sanitized properly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers can disclose sensitive information from the Splunk server (unauthenticated).
*   **Modification of Sensitive Information:** Authenticated users can modify sensitive information on the Splunk server (authenticated).
*   **Complete confidentiality, integrity, and availability violation** (authenticated).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability is reachable over the network.
*   **Direct request to the server:** An attacker can directly request a resource using crafted paths (unauthenticated).
*   **Malicious File Upload:** An authenticated attacker can upload a file with a crafted path (authenticated).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated attack:** An attacker needs network access to the Splunk server.
*  **Authenticated attack:** An attacker needs to have valid login credentials and network access to the Splunk server.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerabilities affect Splunk versions 4.0 through 4.1.1.
*   The vendor has released critical maintenance releases and patches to address the issues.
*   Splunk recommends upgrading to the latest maintenance release or applying the provided critical patch.
*   The advisory mentions that the directory traversal is the most critical issue of the several fixed with this patch.
