Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-2313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. This means that the application allows an attacker to include local files into the application's execution context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Input Handling:** The `page` parameter in the application's URL is vulnerable. The application does not properly sanitize or validate this parameter, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary file paths.
*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not prevent path traversal attempts. This enables an attacker to use relative paths like `../../` to navigate to directories outside of the intended application directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, database connection details, or even system files like `/etc/passwd`. This unauthorized access to sensitive data can lead to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request. The attacker modifies the `page` parameter in the URL to specify the desired file path to be included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application, typically through HTTP(S).
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests and understand basic URL parameters.
*   **Knowledge of the target file system (optional):** While not strictly necessary for exploitation, the attacker's knowledge of the server file system would allow them to target specific files that may contain valuable information.
*   **No authentication required:** The provided exploit does not require any prior authentication.

**Technical Details (from Exploit-DB):**
* The vulnerable software is SIMM Management System (SMS) version 2.
* The vulnerable URL parameter is `page`
* The vulnerable URL path pattern is `http://localhost/[path]/index.php?page=[LFI]`
* Proof of concept attack: `http://localhost/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`
* The `%00` is a null byte which can be used to terminate the string to bypass some sanitization measures.
