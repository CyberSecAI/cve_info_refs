Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-2487:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `theme.add_msg` function in MoinMoin. Specifically, the `template` parameter in the URL was not properly escaped before being passed to `add_msg`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and Javascript code via the `template` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.  The unescaped user input in the `template` parameter is reflected back to the user's browser, allowing execution of malicious code.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided data before using it in the `theme.add_msg` function, which leads to the XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session identifiers (cookies) of legitimate users.
*   **Browser Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit other browser vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript could be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim user within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Unauthorized actions:** A successful XSS attack can allow attackers to perform actions that the user is authorized to do on the vulnerable web application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted malicious URL. An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload in the `template` parameter. For example: `http://<site>/NonExistantUser?action=edit&template=<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to click the malicious URL. This could be achieved via phishing emails or other social engineering tactics.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability affects MoinMoin versions 1.9.2 and prior, 1.7 and 1.8
*   The fix involves escaping the input before passing it to `theme.add_msg`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in MoinMoin versions 1.9.3, 1.7.1-3+lenny5, 1.8.
*   Multiple fixes were required to address all instances of the vulnerability, including in `PageEditor.py`, `action/login.py` and `SlideShow` action.
