{
  "CVE-2010-2962": {
    "Description": "local users could write to any kernel memory location via the i915 GEM ioctl interface. Exploitability requires the presence of a i915 compatible graphics card.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The i915 GEM ioctl interface does not check destination addresses during memory copies.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing sanity checks in `i915_gem_pread_ioctl()` and `i915_gem_pwrite_ioctl()`, which do not perform `access_ok()` checks on `args->data_ptr`.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local users can write to any kernel memory location, leading to local privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access via the i915 GEM ioctl interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with access to the video card. An i915 compatible graphics card is required."
