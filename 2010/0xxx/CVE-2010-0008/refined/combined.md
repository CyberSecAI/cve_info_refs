| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-01-15 06:55:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by our customer, via IT#371682.  a flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Telesys Software for responsibly reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-01-15 07:06:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.  Before updates are applied, it is possible to reduce the risk and mitigate this flaw by blacklisting the sctp kernel module.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: install sctp /bin/true  The sctp module cannot be unloaded from a running kernel if the module is already loaded; therefore, the above changes for /etc/modprobe.conf on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 require a reboot to take effect.  Red Hat Enterprise MRG Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: install sctp /bin/true   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c18)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-02-02 09:57:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c3)) > This issue has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat > Security Response Team. >  > Before updates are applied, it is possible to reduce the risk and mitigate this > flaw by blacklisting the sctp kernel module. >  > Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 > Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: > install sctp /bin/true >  > The sctp module cannot be unloaded from a running kernel if the module is > already loaded; therefore, the above changes for /etc/modprobe.conf on Red Hat > Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 require a reboot to take effect. >  > Red Hat Enterprise MRG > Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: > install sctp /bin/true      For customers who are unable to mitigate this should request for a hotfix via Red Hat Support until a kernel update that addresses this is available.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c19)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-06 05:09:17 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/ece25dfa0991f65c4e1d26beb1c3c45bda4239b8>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 00:18:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0147 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0147.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 00:47:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0146 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0146.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 03:18:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2010:0148 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0148.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 04:03:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3.Z - Server Only  Via RHSA-2010:0149 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0149.html>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-24 15:46:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0172 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0172.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-06 22:57:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2010:0342 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0342.html>   ``` |  |

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0146)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp\_rcv\_ootb() function

in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP
packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.
(CVE-2010-0008, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel. During a

core dump, the kernel did not check if the Virtual Dynamically-linked
Shared Object page was accessible. On Intel 64 and AMD64 systems, a local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a kernel panic by running a
crafted 32-bit application. (CVE-2009-4271, Important)

* an information leak was found in the print\_fatal\_signal() implementation

in the Linux kernel. When "/proc/sys/kernel/print-fatal-signals" is set to
1 (the default value is 0), memory that is reachable by the kernel could be
leaked to user-space. This issue could also result in a system crash. Note
that this flaw only affected the i386 architecture. (CVE-2010-0003,
Moderate)

* on AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure the

ELF interpreter was available before making a call to the SET\_PERSONALITY
macro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by
running a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application.
(CVE-2010-0307, Moderate)

* missing capability checks were found in the ebtables implementation, used

for creating an Ethernet bridge firewall. This could allow a local,
unprivileged user to bypass intended capability restrictions and modify
ebtables rules. (CVE-2010-0007, Low)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* under some circumstances, a locking bug could have caused an online ext3

file system resize to deadlock, which may have, in turn, caused the file
system or the entire system to become unresponsive. In either case, a
reboot was required after the deadlock. With this update, using resize2fs
to perform an online resize of an ext3 file system works as expected.
(BZ#553135)

* some ATA and SCSI devices were not honoring the barrier=1 mount option,

which could result in data loss after a crash or power loss. This update
applies a patch to the Linux SCSI driver to ensure ordered write caching.
This solution does not provide cache flushes; however, it does provide
data integrity on devices that have no write caching (or where write
caching is disabled) and no command queuing. For systems that have command
queuing or write cache enabled there is no guarantee of data integrity
after a crash. (BZ#560563)

* it was found that lpfc\_find\_target() could loop continuously when

scanning a list of nodes due to a missing spinlock. This missing spinlock
allowed the list to be changed after the list\_empty() test, resulting in a
NULL value, causing the loop. This update adds the spinlock, resolving the
issue. (BZ#561453)

* the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0020 introduced a

regression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices using
the Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure WoL for
such devices resulted in the following error, even when configuring valid
options:

"Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported
not setting wol"

This update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected for
network devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#565496)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

Subject: CVE-2010-0008 kernel: sctp remote denial of service

Telesys Software reported a flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb()
function in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP
packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-01-15 06:55:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by our customer, via IT#371682.  a flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Telesys Software for responsibly reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-01-15 07:06:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.  Before updates are applied, it is possible to reduce the risk and mitigate this flaw by blacklisting the sctp kernel module.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: install sctp /bin/true  The sctp module cannot be unloaded from a running kernel if the module is already loaded; therefore, the above changes for /etc/modprobe.conf on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 require a reboot to take effect.  Red Hat Enterprise MRG Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: install sctp /bin/true   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c18)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-02-02 09:57:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c3)) > This issue has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat > Security Response Team. >  > Before updates are applied, it is possible to reduce the risk and mitigate this > flaw by blacklisting the sctp kernel module. >  > Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 > Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: > install sctp /bin/true >  > The sctp module cannot be unloaded from a running kernel if the module is > already loaded; therefore, the above changes for /etc/modprobe.conf on Red Hat > Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 require a reboot to take effect. >  > Red Hat Enterprise MRG > Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: > install sctp /bin/true      For customers who are unable to mitigate this should request for a hotfix via Red Hat Support until a kernel update that addresses this is available.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c19)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-06 05:09:17 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/ece25dfa0991f65c4e1d26beb1c3c45bda4239b8>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 00:18:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0147 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0147.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 00:47:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0146 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0146.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 03:18:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2010:0148 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0148.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 04:03:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3.Z - Server Only  Via RHSA-2010:0149 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0149.html>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-24 15:46:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0172 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0172.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-06 22:57:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2010:0342 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0342.html>   ``` |  |

3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.

 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=560547#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-02-01 05:06:29 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The problem seams to be located in fs/binfmt_elf.c:load_elf_binary(). It calls SET_PERSONALITY() prior checking that the ELF interpreter is available. This in turn makes the previously 32 bit process a 64 bit one which would be fine if execve() would succeed. But after the SET_PERSONALITY() the open_exec() call fails (because it cannot find the interpreter) and execve() almost instantly returns with an error. If you now look at /proc/PID/maps you'll see, that it has the vsyscall page mapped which shouldn't be. But the process is not dead yet, it's still running. By now generating a segmentation fault and in turn trying to generate a core dump the kernel just dies.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enable core dumps 2.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-01-15 06:55:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by our customer, via IT#371682.  a flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function in the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Telesys Software for responsibly reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-01-15 07:06:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.  Before updates are applied, it is possible to reduce the risk and mitigate this flaw by blacklisting the sctp kernel module.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: install sctp /bin/true  The sctp module cannot be unloaded from a running kernel if the module is already loaded; therefore, the above changes for /etc/modprobe.conf on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 require a reboot to take effect.  Red Hat Enterprise MRG Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: install sctp /bin/true   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c18)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-02-02 09:57:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c3)) > This issue has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat > Security Response Team. >  > Before updates are applied, it is possible to reduce the risk and mitigate this > flaw by blacklisting the sctp kernel module. >  > Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 > Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: > install sctp /bin/true >  > The sctp module cannot be unloaded from a running kernel if the module is > already loaded; therefore, the above changes for /etc/modprobe.conf on Red Hat > Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 require a reboot to take effect. >  > Red Hat Enterprise MRG > Add the following entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file: > install sctp /bin/true      For customers who are unable to mitigate this should request for a hotfix via Red Hat Support until a kernel update that addresses this is available.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c19)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-06 05:09:17 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/ece25dfa0991f65c4e1d26beb1c3c45bda4239b8>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 00:18:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0147 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0147.html>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 00:47:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0146 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0146.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 03:18:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2010:0148 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0148.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 04:03:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3.Z - Server Only  Via RHSA-2010:0149 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0149.html>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-24 15:46:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0172 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0172.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=555658#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-06 22:57:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2010:0342 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0342.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
