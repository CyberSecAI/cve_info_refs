Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2010-0951
*   **Vulnerable Software:** dev4u CMS (Personenseiten)
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Root Cause:** The `go_target.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `kontent_id` parameter. The script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, direct use of user-controlled data in SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests to `go_target.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `go_target.php` script. No prior authentication is explicitly stated.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breach: Access to sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
    *   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    *   Complete compromise of the application's database.
*   **Exploit details:**
    *   The vulnerable parameter is `kontent_id`
    *   The exploit uses `union select` to extract data from the database.
    *   The example provided in the exploit extracts the username and password from the `cl_user` table.

This exploit provides more specific information than the standard CVE description would likely contain, including the vulnerable parameter, a proof of concept exploit, and the type of data that can be extracted via the SQL injection vulnerability.
