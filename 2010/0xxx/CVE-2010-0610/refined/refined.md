Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `com_photoblog` component for Joomla, which allows for Blind SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, meaning an attacker cannot see the results of the injected SQL query directly. However, they can infer information by observing the application's behavior (e.g., response times, boolean conditions).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- The attacker could also potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- Complete compromise of the database could lead to full control of the application and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameters:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the `id` parameter in `detail.php` or the `option`, `view`, `category` and `blog` parameters in `index.php` within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax and blind SQL injection techniques.
- **Target Knowledge:** The attacker may require knowledge of database structure to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**
The provided exploit examples show two different entry points:
1. `www.site.com/detail.php?id=[Blind SQL INJECTION]`
2. `www.site.com/index.php?option=com_photoblog&view=images&category=1&celebs&blog=1+and substring(@@version,1,1)=5`

The second example demonstrates the use of a SQL `substring` function for blind SQLi exploitation, which indicates a need for character-by-character data extraction.
