    "cveID": "CVE-2010-0806",
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",

  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles object access when the object has not been properly initialized or has been freed from memory. Specifically, a use-after-free condition occurs in the iepeers.dll file which is used by Internet Explorer to support Web Folders and printing. ",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory corruption",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user. This could lead to complete control of an affected system, potentially allowing the attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. A denial-of-service condition could also be achieved." ,
