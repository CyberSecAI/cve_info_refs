This already appears to have a CVE, fromt he bug report:

ReversingLabs Corp approached CERT-FI about detection evasion attacks found in
many Antivirus software and other signature-based protection software. In
short, the case is related to falures when parsing archive formats.
?ReversingLabs Corp has crafted 15 ZIP, CAB, 7Z and RAR archive files that are
considered valid by the relevant decompressors, but signature based detection
systems cannot detect malicious content contained within them.

CVE: CVE-2010-0098

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- krb5
Specially crafted requests be authenticated remote attackers could
crash the KDC (CVE-2010-1320).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- clamav
Specially crafted CAB archives could crash clamav (CVE-2010-1311) or
bypass virus detection (CVE-2010-0098). clamav has been updated to
version 0.96 which fixes those issues.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- systemtap
Remote attackers could execute arbitrary commands by including shell
meta characters in commands to the stap server (CVE-2009-4273).
Commands with a long arguments list could cause a buffer overflow
and crash the system if a script tried to retrieve the argument list
(CVE-2010-0411).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- apache2
When using a multithreaded MPM apache could leak memory of requests
handled by a different thread when processing subrequests
(CVE-2010-0434).
Specially crafted requests could crash mod\_proxy\_ajp (CVE-2010-0408).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- glib2
The when copying symbolic links the g\_file\_copy function set the
target of the link to mode 0777 therefore exposing potentially
sensitive information or allowing other user to modify files they
should not have access to (CVE-2009-3289).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- mediawiki
MediaWiki was prone to a CSS validation flaw and data leakage
vulnerability (CVE-2010-1189, CVE-2010-1190).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- apache
Specially crafted requests could lead to an integer overflow in
mod\_proxy. Attackers could exploit that to crash apache or
potentially cause execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2010-0010).
The problem only affects 64bit architectures.
Affected Products: SLES9

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.

#### Security Update 2010-005

* **ATS**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1808

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A stack buffer overlow exists in Apple Type Services' handling of embedded fonts. Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1800

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: CFNetwork permits anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue does not affect the Mail application. This issue is addressed by disabling anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6.3. Credit to Aaron Sigel of vtty.com, Jean-Luc Giraud of Citrix, Tomas Bjurman of Sirius IT, and Wan-Teh Chang of Google, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **ClamAV**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0098, CVE-2010-1311

  Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues by updating ClamAV to version 0.96.1. ClamAV is distributed only with Mac OS X Server systems. Further information is available via the ClamAV website at <http://www.clamav.net/>

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1801

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files. Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking. Credit to Rodrigo Rubira Branco from the Check Point Vulnerability Discovery Team (VDT) for reporting this issue.

* **libsecurity**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1802

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position who can obtain a domain name that differs only in the last characters from the name of a legitimate domain may impersonate hosts in that domain

  Description: An issue exists in the handling of certificate host names. For host names containing three or more components, the last characters are not properly compared. In the case of a name containing exactly three components, only the last character is not checked. For example, if an attacker in a privileged network position could obtain a certificate for www.example.con the attacker can impersonate www.example.com. This issue is addressed through improved handling of certificate host names. Credit to Peter Speck for reporting this issue.

* **PHP**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1205

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4
