**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*  **Information Disclosure/Path Traversal:** Could allow attackers to gain access to sensitive files or information not intended for public access.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are present in third-party TYPO3 extensions, meaning that an attacker would need to target the specific vulnerable extensions within a TYPO3 installation.
*   The specific attack vectors for each vulnerability would vary depending on the extension's functionality and the vulnerability's root cause (e.g., through user input, crafted requests).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have knowledge of a TYPO3 site using the vulnerable extensions.
*   For SQL injection vulnerabilities, the attacker would need the ability to submit malicious input that can manipulate database queries.
*   For XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the browser of a victim visiting a page using the vulnerable extension.
* For information disclosure/path traversal, an attacker needs to send crafted requests to access files or folders.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that some extensions with vulnerabilities were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the authors not providing updates or being unreachable. Users are advised to uninstall and delete these extensions.
*   The advisory refers to the TYPO3 Security Cookbook for general security advice.
*   The document also mentions that this is a Collective Security Bulletin (CSB) for less significant extensions to reduce the workload of the security team.
