  "CVE-2010-0205": {
    "description": "libpng does not properly handle compressed ancillary-chunk data that has a disproportionately large uncompressed representation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption, and  application hang) via a crafted PNG file",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of compressed ancillary chunk data in libpng.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Denial of Service",
		"Resource Exhaustion"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending a specially crafted PNG file, leading to excessive memory and CPU consumption, and application hang.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation via crafted PNG files."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send a crafted PNG file to a user or system that processes it."
