- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input validation vulnerability when parsing the `JMSDestination` parameter from a GET request to `/createDestination.action` page. The value of this parameter is directly inserted into the HTML code without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored/Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the ActiveMQ administration console, allowing them to steal cookies, inject content into pages, or submit requests using the user's credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malicious GET request to the `/createDestination.action` endpoint with a crafted `JMSDestination` parameter containing the XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send the malicious request remotely.
