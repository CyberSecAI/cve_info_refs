  "CVE-2010-0738": {
    "description": "By using a specially crafted HTTP request, the authentication of the jmx-console can be bypassed, as the access restrictions only apply for GET and POST. Current setting is: <security-constraint>  <web-resource-collection>   <web-resource-name>HtmlAdaptor</web-resource-name>   <description>An example security config that only allows users with the   role JBossAdmin to access the HTML JMX console web application   </description>   <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>   <http-method>GET</http-method>   <http-method>POST</http-method>  </web-resource-collection>  <auth-constraint>   <role-name>JBossAdmin</role-name>  </auth-constraint> </security-constraint> and should be changed to block ALL http-methods.",
    "root_cause": "The JMX Console configuration only specified an authentication requirement for requests that used the GET and POST HTTP methods, while other HTTP methods were not being restricted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Incomplete HTTP method restriction"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote unauthorized disclosure of information. Attackers could bypass authentication to access the JMX console.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could create an HTTP request that does not specify GET or POST, causing it to be executed by the default GET handler without authentication.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
