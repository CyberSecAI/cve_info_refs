| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=574105#c0)  Marc Schoenefeld    2010-03-16 16:20:35 UTC  ``` By using a specially crafted HTTP request, the authentication  of the jmx-console can be bypassed, as the access restrictions  only apply for GET and POST.   Current setting is:   <security-constraint>    <web-resource-collection>      <web-resource-name>HtmlAdaptor</web-resource-name>      <description>An example security config that only allows users with the        role JBossAdmin to access the HTML JMX console web application      </description>      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>      <http-method>GET</http-method>      <http-method>POST</http-method>    </web-resource-collection>    <auth-constraint>      <role-name>JBossAdmin</role-name>    </auth-constraint>  </security-constraint>   and should be changed to block ALL http-methods.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon of Minded Security for responsibly reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=574105#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-27 03:19:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.2.0 for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2010:0376 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0376.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=574105#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-27 03:39:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2010:0377 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0377.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=574105#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-27 03:55:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.2.0 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2010:0378 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0378.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=574105#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-27 04:15:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2010:0379 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0379.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=574105#c9)  Mark J.

Users of the community JBoss Application Server can secure their JMX Console on vulnerable versions by following the instructions here:  <https://community.jboss.org/wiki/SecureTheJmxConsole>   ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBEAP) 4.3 packages that fix
three security issues and multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 as JBEAP 4.3.0.CP08.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market leading platform for
innovative and scalable Java applications; integrating the JBoss
Application Server, with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam into a complete,
simple enterprise solution.

This release of JBEAP for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 serves as a
replacement to JBEAP 4.3.0.CP07.

These updated packages include multiple bug fixes which are detailed in the
Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from the link
in the References section.

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

The JMX Console configuration only specified an authentication requirement
for requests that used the GET and POST HTTP "verbs". A remote attacker
could create an HTTP request that does not specify GET or POST, causing it
to be executed by the default GET handler without authentication. This
release contains a JMX Console with an updated configuration that no longer
specifies the HTTP verbs. This means that the authentication requirement is
applied to all requests. (CVE-2010-0738)

For the CVE-2010-0738 issue, if an immediate upgrade is not possible or the
server deployment has been customized, a manual fix can be applied. Refer
to the "Security" subsection of the "Issues fixed in this release" section
(JBPAPP-3952) of the JBEAP Release Notes, linked to in the References, for
details. Contact Red Hat JBoss Support for advice before making the changes
noted in the Release Notes.

Red Hat would like to thank Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon of Minded
Security for responsibly reporting the CVE-2010-0738 issue.

Unauthenticated access to the JBoss Application Server Web Console
(/web-console) is blocked by default. However, it was found that this block
was incomplete, and only blocked GET and POST HTTP verbs. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information. This release
contains a Web Console with an updated configuration that now blocks all
unauthenticated access to it by default. (CVE-2010-1428)

The RHSA-2008:0828 update fixed an issue (CVE-2008-3273) where
unauthenticated users were able to access the status servlet; however, a
bug fix included in the RHSA-2009:0349 update re-introduced the issue. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire details about deployed web
contexts. (CVE-2010-1429)

Warning: Before applying this update, please backup the JBEAP
"server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, and any other customized
configuration files.

All users of JBEAP 4.3 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=574105#c0)  Marc Schoenefeld    2010-03-16 16:20:35 UTC  ``` By using a specially crafted HTTP request, the authentication  of the jmx-console can be bypassed, as the access restrictions  only apply for GET and POST.   Current setting is:   <security-constraint>    <web-resource-collection>      <web-resource-name>HtmlAdaptor</web-resource-name>      <description>An example security config that only allows users with the        role JBossAdmin to access the HTML JMX console web application      </description>      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>      <http-method>GET</http-method>      <http-method>POST</http-method>    </web-resource-collection>    <auth-constraint>      <role-name>JBossAdmin</role-name>    </auth-constraint>  </security-constraint>   and should be changed to block ALL http-methods.
