This document provides a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party TYPO3 extensions. It is relevant to CVE-2010-0322 as it details vulnerabilities in specific TYPO3 extensions.

**Vulnerabilities:**

The advisory lists multiple extensions with the following vulnerability types:

*   **SQL Injection:** This vulnerability exists in multiple extensions including `mk_anydropdownmenu`, `ref_list`, `powermail`, `jf_easymaps`, `tv21_talkshow`, `mg_help`, `vote_for_tt_news`, `dl3_tt_news_alerts`, `ttpedit`, `vm19_userlinks`, `mjseventpro`, `bb_simplejobs`, `job_reports`, `pb_clanlist`, and `zak_store_management`.
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially manipulate database queries, allowing them to read or modify sensitive data, bypass authentication, or even execute arbitrary code on the database server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted input injected through web forms or other input points of the vulnerable extensions.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to interact with the vulnerable web application and knowledge of the input mechanisms used by the vulnerable extensions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability exists in `devlog`, `kj_imagelightbox2`, `cs2_unitconv`, `tv21_talkshow`, `vote_for_tt_news`, `majordomo`, `mimi_tipfriends`, and `vd_geomap`.
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input, which is then displayed in a web page without proper encoding.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to stealing user session cookies, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious scripts injected through web forms or other input points of the vulnerable extensions.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to interact with the vulnerable web application and knowledge of the input mechanisms used by the vulnerable extensions.
*   **Information Disclosure / Path Traversal:** This vulnerability is found in `goof_fotoboek` and `sb_folderdownload`, as well as `kiddog_mysqldumper`.
    *   **Root Cause:**  The software does not properly restrict access to files or directories and allows for arbitrary paths to be specified by user input.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive files and directories outside the intended scope of the application, potentially exposing configuration files, database backups, or other sensitive data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted file paths injected through web forms or other input points of the vulnerable extensions.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to interact with the vulnerable web application and knowledge of the input mechanisms used by the vulnerable extensions.

**Specific Extension Details:**

The advisory provides details for each vulnerable extension:

*   **Extension Name:**  (e.g., MK-AnydropdownMenu, Photo Book)
*   **Affected Versions:**  (e.g., 0.3.28 and all versions below)
*   **Vulnerability Type:** (e.g., SQL Injection, Information Disclosure)
*   **Severity:** (High or Medium)
*   **Solution:** (Update to a patched version, or uninstall the extension if no fix is available).
*   **Credits:** (Individuals who discovered and reported the vulnerability)

**General Information:**
* The advisory notes that these are vulnerabilities in third-party extensions and not in the core TYPO3 system.
* It is a "Collective Security Bulletin" (CSB), grouping less critical vulnerabilities to reduce the workload of the security team.
* For some extensions without available fixes, the recommendation is to uninstall them.

**Note:** This document provides more details than a typical CVE description by listing all vulnerable extensions, the exact versions affected, and the type of vulnerabilities found in each extension.
