  "cveId": "CVE-2010-0206",
  "description": "xpdf allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) in the way it processes JBIG2 PDF stream objects.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of JBIG2 PDF stream objects within xpdf. Specifically, a NULL pointer dereference occurs during the processing of these objects.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS). This is achieved by triggering a NULL pointer dereference, which leads to the application crashing.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "The attack vector is remote, involving a specially crafted PDF file"
      ],
      "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file that contains a specially crafted JBIG2 stream object. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the user must open the file. "
