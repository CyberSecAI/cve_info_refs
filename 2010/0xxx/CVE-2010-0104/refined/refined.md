The provided content is related to CVE-2010-0104.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the Broadcom NetXtreme management firmware when handling malformed ASF version 2.0 RAKP Message 1 packets.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the ASF handling code of the firmware.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the embedded management controller or cause the controller to halt operation, leading to a denial of service.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, utilizing malformed ASF version 2.0 RAKP Message 1 packets sent over the network. The vulnerability can only be exploited if the Remote Management and Control Protocol (RMCP) over the RMCP Security-Extensions Protocol (RSP) manageability is enabled.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network packets to the affected device on ports 623/udp or 664/udp, within the same network perimeter if the network perimeter blocks the ports.
