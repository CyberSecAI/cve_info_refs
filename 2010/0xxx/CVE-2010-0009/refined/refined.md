Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-0009

**Vulnerability:** Timing Attack

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of simple "break-on-inequality" string comparisons when verifying hashes and passwords in Apache CouchDB versions prior to 0.11.0. This type of comparison is vulnerable to timing attacks.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Timing Side Channel:** The primary vulnerability is a timing side channel. By measuring the time it takes for the system to compare a provided password/hash with the stored one, an attacker can gain information about the correctness of the provided data, even without knowing the correct value.
*   **Insecure String Comparison:** The use of a basic string comparison that breaks upon encountering a difference makes the timing of the comparison dependent on how many characters match.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially recover passwords or sensitive hashes through repeated timing measurements by trying different characters or combinations and observing the response times.
*   Information leakage about the system, such as password/hash structure, is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is network-based since the attacker would need to send password/hash attempts and measure the server's response times.
*   An attacker could also attempt locally, if they have access to the machine running CouchDB

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the CouchDB service.
*   The attacker needs the ability to measure the time taken for a request.
*   No special privileges are mentioned as needed, just the ability to send requests and measure responses.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Apache CouchDB versions prior to 0.11.0.
*   It was fixed in versions 0.10.2 and 0.11.0
*   The fix involved changing how the string comparison is handled to prevent timing differences
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entries mention Fedora releases 11, 12, 13 and EPEL-5 as affected and receiving updates
