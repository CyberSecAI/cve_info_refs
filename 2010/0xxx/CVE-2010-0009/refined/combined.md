"Amongst all the panic and horror [of a power outage], I was smiling."
[- Assaf Morami](https://blog.couchdb.org/2017/07/19/a-couchdb-user-story-chatting-with-assaf-morami/)

"The replication in CouchDB is really the killer feature that sets it
apart from other databases."
[- Patrick Wolf](https://blog.couchdb.org/2017/07/12/replication-makes-couchdb-the-single-best-solution-for-hoptree/)

"Even if the internet was very bad our databases in the two locations would eventually sync."

## Data Where You Need It

Apache CouchDB ™ lets you access your data where you need it. The **[Couch Replication Protocol](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/protocol.html "Couch Replication Protocol")** is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from **globally distributed server-clusters**, over **mobile phones** to **web browsers**.

Store your data **safely**, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks **JSON natively** and supports **binary data** for all your data storage needs.

**[The Couch Replication Protocol](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/protocol.html "CouchDB Replication Protocol")** lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling **[offline-first](https://offlinefirst.org)** user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a **developer-friendly** query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.

See the [introduction](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/intro/why.html), [technical overview](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/intro/overview.html) for more information, or learn [whatâs new in 3.3](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/whatsnew/3.3.html).

### Single Node Database

CouchDB is a terrific single-node database that works just like any other database
behind an application server of your choice.

Most people start with a single node CouchDB instance. More demanding projects can
seamlessly upgrade to a cluster.

### Cluster

CouchDB is *also* a clustered database that allows you to run a single logical
database server on any number of servers or VMs.

A CouchDB cluster improves on the single-node setup with higher capacity and
high-availability without changing any APIs.

### HTTP/JSON

CouchDB makes use of the ubiquitous HTTP protocol and JSON data format and is
compatible with any software that supports them. CouchDB also works great with
external tools like HTTP proxy servers, load balancers.

### Offline First Data Sync

CouchDBâs unique [Replication Protocol](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/protocol.html) is the
foundation for a whole new generation of [âOffline
Firstâ](https://offlinefirst.org/) applications for Mobile applications and other environments with [challenging
network infrastructures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sLjWlWvCsc).

### Ecosystem

CouchDB is built for servers (from a Raspberry Pi to big cloud installations), while
[PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) is built for mobile & web-browsers.

They can seamlessly replicate data with each other.

### Reliability

CouchDB is serious about data reliability.

Individual nodes use a crash-resistant append-only data structure. A multi-node
CouchDB cluster saves all data redundantly, so it is always available when you need
it.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
