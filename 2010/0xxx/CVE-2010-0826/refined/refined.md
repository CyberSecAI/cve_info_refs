  "relevancy": "related",
  "CVE_ID": "CVE-2010-0826",
  "summary": "The libnss-db library in Ubuntu incorrectly reads a DB_CONFIG file from the current directory instead of the intended location, leading to a potential information disclosure vulnerability.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to libnss-db attempting to read a DB_CONFIG file in the current working directory, instead of the expected /var/lib/misc directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect file path resolution",
        "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this by creating a symbolic link named 'DB_CONFIG' in a directory where a setuid or setgid binary is executed. This would cause the binary to read the content of the linked file, potentially revealing sensitive information, such as excerpts from /etc/shadow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation",
      "Creation of a symbolic link in the current directory"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to create a symbolic link named `DB_CONFIG` in a directory where a setuid or setgid command is executed."
