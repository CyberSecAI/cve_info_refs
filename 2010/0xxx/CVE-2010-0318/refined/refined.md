{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When replaying a 'setattr' transaction, the ZFS replay code would set file attributes to insecure defaults (07777) if those attributes weren't explicitly specified in the logged transaction.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure default file permissions being applied during ZFS Intent Log (ZIL) replay.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A system crash or power failure could result in files having their mode set to 07777, potentially leaking sensitive information or leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "System crash or power failure while using ZFS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No attacker action is required other than causing a system crash or power failure."
