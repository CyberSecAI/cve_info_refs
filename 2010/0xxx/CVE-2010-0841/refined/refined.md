  "CVE-2010-0841": {
    "Description": "The content provided describes a vulnerability in the processing of JPEG image dimensions within the Sun Java Runtime Environment. Specifically, specifying large values for subsample dimensions can cause an integer overflow, leading to memory corruption and potentially allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability requires user interaction, as the target must visit a malicious web page containing a crafted JPEG image.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow during processing of JPEG image dimensions, triggered by large subsample values, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the current user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a web page containing a maliciously crafted untrusted Java applet.",
      "Processing a crafted JPEG image."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious JPEG image with specific subsample dimensions and host it on a web page or deliver it through other means, and the ability to lure the target user into interacting with the malicious content.",
       "Affected Products": [
        "Java Runtime Environment (various versions, including 1.6.0_17, 1.5.0_22, JDK and JRE 6 Update 18, JDK 5.0 Update 23, SDK 1.4.2_25)",
        "HP Network Node Manager I (NNMi) v9.0x running JDK for HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows",
        "VMware vCenter Server, vCenter Update Manager, ESXi and ESX (through Oracle JRE)",
        "HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23, B.11.31 running HP JDK and JRE 6.0.06 or earlier, 5.0.19 or earlier, and 1.4.2.24 or earlier",
         "Red Hat Products that use the affected Java versions",
        "openSUSE Products that use the affected Java versions"
    ]
