{
  "CVE-2010-0296": {
    "Description": "The encode_name macro in misc/mntent_r.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.11.1 and earlier, as used by ncpmount and mount.cifs, does not properly handle newline characters in mountpoint names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption), or possibly modify mount options and gain privileges, via a crafted mount request.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied mount point names containing special characters, specifically newline characters, within the glibc's utility responsible for editing the system's mtab table.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect handling of newline characters in mountpoint names by the `encode_name` macro in `mntent_r.c`",
      "Lack of proper input validation/sanitization when writing to the mtab table"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local attackers can corrupt the system's `/etc/mtab` file by injecting arbitrary mount points or setting unauthorized mount options. In some cases, this could lead to privilege escalation if the tool used for editing /etc/mtab is setuid root and doesn't perform additional checks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafting a mount request with a mountpoint name containing newline characters.",
       "Exploiting vulnerable mount helpers that allow injecting newlines into mount entries."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access is required. The attacker must be able to create a directory with newline characters in its name and use a vulnerable tool like `ncpmount` or `mount.cifs` to mount to it."
