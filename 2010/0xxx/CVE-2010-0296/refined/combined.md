| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=559579#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-01-28 14:35:30 UTC  ``` It was found that glibc's utility, responsible for editing of system's mtab table, improperly sanitized user supplied mount point names containing certain special character. Local attacker could use this flaw to add arbitrary mount points (corrupt system's "/etc/mtab" file) or, potentially, set unauthorized mount options. Other attacks are also possible.  Issue severity note: ------------------- The /etc/mtab file handles mounted devices and is automatically updated by the mount command (more precisely by the dedicated "mount" tool for relevant filesystem). Unprivileged user to be able to run such a tool (and modify content of /etc/mtab), this tool needs to be suid root enabled. The dedicated "mount" tools, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (mount.cifs, mount.fuse, fusermount, mount.nfs, mount.nfs4) does NOT allow unprivileged user to use them (without prior grant of additional privileges from the privileged user) for editing of system's /etc/mtab file, which mitigates impact of this flaw.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=559579#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-02 14:48:16 UTC  ``` Public via:   [1] <http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-944-1>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=559579#c11)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-02 14:52:43 UTC  ``` [CVE-2010-0296](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0296) description from Mitre:  The encode_name macro in misc/mntent_r.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.11.1 and earlier, as used by ncpmount and mount.cifs, does not properly handle newline characters in mountpoint names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption), or possibly modify mount options and gain privileges, via a crafted mount request.

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not
correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon family of
functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into
processing a specially crafted format string, a remote attacker
could crash applications, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2010-0296

Jeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did
not correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If
a local attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry
through other vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the
system or possibly gain root privileges.

CVE-2010-0830

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly
validate certain ELF program headers.  If a user or automated system
were tricked into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a
remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7-18lenny4 of the glibc package.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems has been fixed in
version 2.1.11-1 of the eglibc package.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc or eglibc packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# glibc

2010-04-22

Page content

* [CVEs:](#cves)

* Author: Miklos Vajna
* Vulnerable: 2.11.1-1
* Unaffected: 2.11.1-2locris1

Dan Rosenberg reported two security issues in glibc:

1. “ncpmount” and “mount.cifs” failed to properly sanitize provided mountpoint directory names (specifically, special characters such as newlines were not stripped). An attacker could create a directory with newline characters in its name and issue an ncpmount / mount.cifs command to mount to that directory, allowing them to corrupt /etc/mtab and potentially add unauthorized mounting options for other devices.
2. A memory corruption vulnerability in ld.so: When processing maliciously crafted ELF binaries using ld.so, regardless of whether execution of those binaries is intended (for example, using the “–verify” flag, which should not lead to any code execution), arbitrary code execution can be achieved.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux C library glibc was updated to fix critical security issues and several bugs:
CVE-2010-3847: Decoding of the $ORIGIN special value in various LD\_
environment variables allowed local attackers to execute code in
context of e.g. setuid root programs, elevating privileges.
This specific issue did not affect SUSE as an assertion triggers
before the respective code is executed. The bug was fixed by this
update nevertheless.
CVE-2010-3856: The LD\_AUDIT environment was not pruned during setuid
root execution and could load shared libraries from standard system
library paths.
This could be used by local attackers to inject code into setuid root
programs and so elevated privileges.
Both of these were found by Tavis Ormandy and we thank him for finding
and reporting those issues.
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 is not affected by the above problems,
as its glibc does neither support LD\_AUDIT nor the $ORIGIN expansion
required by the first problem.
On openSUSE 11.1, 11.2 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 3
and SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 GA also the following minor security
issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-0830: Integer overflow causing arbitrary code execution
in ld.so --verify mode could be induced by a specially crafted
binary. This would require running the code on untrusted code which
we did not consider likely.
We thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting this problem.
CVE-2010-0296: The addmntent() function would not escape the newline
character properly, allowing the user to insert arbitrary newlines
to the /etc/mtab; if the addmntent() is run by a setuid mount binary
that does not do extra input check, this would allow custom entries
to be inserted in /etc/mtab.
We thank Dan Rosenberg and Jeff Layton for reporting this problem.
CVE-2008-1391: The strfmon() function contains an integer overflow
vulnerability in width specifiers handling that could be triggered
by an attacker that can control the format string passed to strfmon().
We thank Maksymilian Arciemowicz for reporting this problem.
CVE-2010-0015: Some setups (mainly Solaris-based legacy setups)
include shadow information (password hashes) as so-called "adjunct
passwd" table, mangling it with the rest of passwd columns instead
of keeping it in the shadow table. Normally, Solaris will disclose
this information only to clients bound to a privileged port, but
when nscd is deployed on the client, getpwnam() would disclose the
password hashes to all users. New mode "adjunct as shadow" can now
be enabled in /etc/default/nss that will move the password hashes
from the world-readable passwd table to emulated shadow table (that
is not cached by nscd).
We thank Christoph Pleger for reporting this problem.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
A reboot is not required to activate this change.
However as old processes will still be using the old C library, a reboot
is at least recommended.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-944-1: GNU C Library vulnerabilities

25 May 2010

The GNU C library did not correctly handle certain mnt entries, strfmon
arguments, and ELF program headers.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [eglibc](/security/cves?package=eglibc) - Shared system libraries
* [glibc](/security/cves?package=glibc) - Shared system libraries

## Details

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not

correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon function. If a user

or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted

format string, a remote attacker could crash applications, leading to

a denial of service. (Ubuntu 10.04 was not affected.) ([CVE-2008-1391](/security/CVE-2008-1391))

Jeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not

correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If a local

attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry through other

vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the system or possibly gain

root privileges. ([CVE-2010-0296](/security/CVE-2010-0296))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly validate

certain ELF program headers. If a user or automated system were tricked

into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a remote attacker could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2010-0830](/security/CVE-2010-0830))

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc)
  -
  [2.9-4ubuntu6.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc/2.9-4ubuntu6.2)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc)
  -
  [2.7-10ubuntu6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc/2.7-10ubuntu6)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc)
  -
  [2.3.6-0ubuntu20.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc/2.3.6-0ubuntu20.6)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/eglibc)
  -
  [2.11.1-0ubuntu7.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/eglibc/2.11.1-0ubuntu7.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart all services to make

the necessary changes.

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:

            on 7th June, SEC Consult proposes new advisory release date for
            12th June
2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.

Source: <http://www.wago.us/wago/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the available patches
from the vendor. A thorough security review should be performed by
security professionals to identify further potential security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The industrial managed switch series 852 from WAGO is affected by multiple
vulnerabilities such as old software components embedded in the firmware.
Furthermore, hardcoded password hashes and credentials were also found by doing
an automated scan with IoT Inspector. Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544 and
CVE-2015-0235) were verified by emulating the device with the MEDUSA scaleable
firmware runtime. The validity of the password hashes and the embedded keys were
also verified by emulating the device.

1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
The used BusyBox toolkit in version 1.12.0 is outdated and contains multiple
known vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector.
One of the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using
the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
The used GNU glibc in version 2.8 is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of
the discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-0235, "GHOST") was verified by
using the MEDUSA scaleable firmware runtime.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The device contains hardcoded users and passwords which can be used to login
via SSH and Telnet.

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The device contains hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon. The fingerprint
of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches to the embedded
private key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Known BusyBox Vulnerabilities
BusyBox version 1.12.0 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2013-1813, CVE-2016-2148, CVE-2016-6301, CVE-2011-2716, CVE-2011-5325,
CVE-2015-9261, CVE-2016-2147 and more.

The BusyBox shell autocompletion vulnerability (CVE-2017-16544) was verified on
an emulated device. A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created
to trigger the vulnerability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Known GNU glibc Vulnerabilities
GNU glibc version 2.8 contains multiple CVEs like:
CVE-2010-0296, CVE-2010-3856, CVE-2012-4412, CVE-2014-4043, CVE-2014-9402,
CVE-2014-9761, CVE-2014-9984, CVE-2015-1472 and more.

The gethostbyname buffer overflow vulnerability (GHOST) was checked with the help
of the exploit code from <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/274>. It was compiled
and executed on the emulated device to test the system.

3) Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-12550)
The following credentials were found in the 'passwd' file of the firmware:
<Password Hash>                                 <Plaintext>         <User>
<removed>                                       <removed>            root
No password is set for the account              [EMPTY PASSWORD]     admin

By using these credentials, it's possible to connect via Telnet and SSH on the
emulated device. Example for Telnet:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# telnet 192.168.0.133
Trying 192.168.0.133...
Connected to 192.168.0.133.
Escape character is '^]'.

L2SWITCH login: root
Password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for SSH:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
root@192.168.0.133's password:
~ #
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Embedded Private Keys (CVE-2019-12549)
The following host key fingerprint is shown by accessing the SSH daemon on
the emulated device:

[root@localhost ~]# ssh 192.168.0.133
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.133 (192.168.0.133)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X5Vr0/x0/j62N/aqZmHz96ojwl8x/I8mfzuT8o6uZso.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2.

This matches the embedded private key (which has been removed from this advisory):
SSH Fingerprint: 2e:65:85:fc:45:04:bd:68:30:74:51:45:7d:2f:95:e2

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
According to the vendor, the following versions are affected:
* 852-303: <v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: <v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: <v1.1.5.S0

            on 7th June, SEC Consult proposes new advisory release date for
            12th June
2019-06-07: VDE CERT provides security advisory information from WAGO;
            WAGO releases security patches
2019-06-12: Coordinated release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides patches to their customers at their download page. The
following versions fix the issues:
* 852-303: v1.2.2.S0
* 852-1305: v1.1.6.S0
* 852-1505: v1.1.5.S0

According to the vendor, busybox and glibc have been updated and the embedded
private keys are being newly generated upon first boot and after a factory reset.
The root login via Telnet and SSH has been disabled and the admin account is
documented and can be changed by the customer.

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device & SSH server.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GNU C library: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201011-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in glibc, the worst of which allowing
local attackers to execute arbitrary code as root.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.11.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.11.2-r3** |

### Background

The GNU C library is the standard C library used by Gentoo Linux
systems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in glibc, amongst others the
widely-known recent LD\_AUDIT and $ORIGIN issues. For further
information please consult the CVE entries referenced below.

### Impact

A local attacker could execute arbitrary code as root, cause a Denial
of Service, or gain privileges. Additionally, a user-assisted remote
attacker could cause the execution of arbitrary code, and a
context-dependent attacker could cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNU C library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/glibc-2.11.2-r3"
```
