  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2010-0398",
    "description": "The init script in autokey before 0.61.3-2 allows local attackers to write to arbitrary files via a symlink attack.",
    "affected_component": "autokey init script",
    "root_cause": "Insecure use of temporary files within the init script.",
    "vulnerability_details": "The autokey init script creates a temporary file, such as a PID file, in /tmp. An attacker can exploit this by creating a symbolic link to a different file in /tmp with the same name as the temporary file the init script attempts to create.  When the init script starts, it will then write to the attacker's chosen file.",
    "impact": "Local attackers can overwrite arbitrary files, potentially leading to data corruption or local denial of service.",
     "attack_vector": "Local access",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker requires local access to the system and the ability to create symbolic links.",
    "affected_versions": "autokey versions before 0.61.3-2",
    "fixed_versions": "autokey 0.61.3-2 and later",
