# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. It also includes non-security fixes that are required (because of interdependencies) by those security patches. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative, except as noted below, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2010 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1159443.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=77924097606278&id=1159443.1).

### Unsupported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/).

We recommend that customers upgrade to a supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches. Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=77937127389943&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2010 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1159443.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=77924097606278&id=1159443.1) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the [Oracle Database](#AppendixDB) and [Fusion Middleware](#AppendixAS) sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2010 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite.
