    "CVE-2010-0787": {
      "description": "Multiple sources indicate this CVE is related to a race condition in the mount.cifs utility when verifying user permissions, allowing local attackers to trick samba into mounting over arbitrary locations, leading to root privilege escalation.",
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the mount.cifs utility when verifying user permissions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition in permission verification.",
	      "Improper handling of mount points, allowing arbitrary locations to be targeted"
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root due to the ability to mount over arbitrary locations.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local attack by exploiting the race condition in mount.cifs.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to execute mount.cifs (potentially requiring setuid permissions if not root), or a system misconfiguration allowing users to execute the utility. The attacker also requires the ability to create symlinks in mount point.",
      "additional_details": "Some sources mention that `mount.cifs` is not setuid root by default, mitigating the issue unless configured otherwise, and also note that a race condition in `mount.cifs` can lead to a corruption of `/etc/mtab`."
