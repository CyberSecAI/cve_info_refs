Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-0315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how WebKit (the rendering engine used by Safari and Google Chrome) handles the `href` property of stylesheets when redirects occur.  Specifically, the `href` property was returning the *final* URL after a redirect, rather than the *original* URL as specified in the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that the redirected URL, which might contain sensitive information like session IDs or CSRF tokens in the query string, becomes accessible through JavaScript via `document.styleSheets[0].href`.
* **Incorrect Base URL:** The base URL for the stylesheet was also being incorrectly set to the redirected URL, which could cause issues with relative URLs within the stylesheet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Session Hijacking/CSRF Attacks:** An attacker could potentially obtain a user's session ID or CSRF token if the user visits a malicious website that loads a stylesheet from a vulnerable site that redirects. This could lead to account hijacking or CSRF attacks.
* **Login Status Detection:** An attacker could determine if a user is logged into a particular website by comparing the original and final URLs of a stylesheet loaded from a login-protected area. If a redirect occurs, the user is likely logged in.
* **Other potential information leakage:** The redirected URL might contain other useful information that can be used for further attacks, although this was not elaborated on in the provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a malicious web page that loads a stylesheet from a vulnerable website.
* The vulnerable website would need to redirect the stylesheet request, with potentially sensitive parameters in the redirect URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage with malicious JavaScript.
* The attacker needs the user to visit their malicious webpage while the user has an active session on a vulnerable website.
* No direct interaction with the vulnerable server is needed since the vulnerability is client-side.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Browser differences:** Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox were not vulnerable to this issue. They correctly displayed the original URL.
* **Fix:** The fix involved teaching `StyleSheet` objects to differentiate between the original and final URLs. The `href` property was modified to return the original URL while the base URL used for resolving relative paths within the stylesheet was set to the final URL.
* **Test:** A test (`http/tests/security/stylesheet-href-redirect.html`) was added to ensure the fix was correct.
* **XSL Stylesheets:** While a test was added for CSS stylesheets, it was noted that it was unclear how to test the XSL stylesheet behavior.
* **Patch Confirmation:** The vulnerability was confirmed to be fixed in Google Chrome 4.0.249.89.
