One of those attacker-controlled overflows is demonstrated by MWR Lab reproducer.  This attack vector is mitigated on RHEL5 by FORTIFY_SOURCE, reducing impact to crash.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-03 13:07:03 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:   <http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pcsclite/?sc=1&rev=4208>   <http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pcsclite/?sc=1&rev=4334>  Issues should be fixed in upstream version 1.5.4.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-04 14:01:36 UTC  ``` pcscd in RHEL5 and Fedora runs as user root, but is confined in a restricted SELinux domain (pcscd_t).   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-11 08:09:20 UTC  ``` Public now via Debian DSA-2059-1:   <http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2059>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c11)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-15 19:23:27 UTC  ``` pcsc-lite-1.5.2-4.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pcsc-lite-1.5.2-4.fc12>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c12)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-15 19:23:36 UTC  ``` pcsc-lite-1.5.2-3.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pcsc-lite-1.5.2-3.fc11>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c13)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-16 17:40:57 UTC  ``` pcsc-lite-1.5.2-3.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

The descriptions are a bit confusing, but by the sounds of them, [CVE-2009-4901](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4901) and [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) affect us, and [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902) is due to the incorrect fix for [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) (which we had not previously fixed, so would not affect us).  Name: [CVE-2009-4901](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4901)  The MSGFunctionDemarshall function in winscard_svc.c in the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (aka PCSCD) in MUSCLE PCSC-Lite before 1.5.4 might allow local users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via crafted SCARD_SET_ATTRIB message data, which is improperly demarshalled and triggers a buffer over-read, a related issue to [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407).  Name: [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902)  Buffer overflow in the MSGFunctionDemarshall function in winscard_svc.c in the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (aka PCSCD) in MUSCLE PCSC-Lite 1.5.4 and earlier might allow local users to gain privileges via crafted SCARD_CONTROL message data, which is improperly demarshalled.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407).  Name: [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407)  Multiple buffer overflows in the MSGFunctionDemarshall function in winscard_svc.c in the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (aka PCSCD) in MUSCLE PCSC-Lite before 1.5.4 allow local users to gain privileges via crafted message data, which is improperly demarshalled.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c16)  Asha Akkiangady    2010-06-18 17:49:26 UTC  ``` Installed 'pcsc-lite-1.4.4-2.el5_5' and performed smart card regression tests such as token enroll/format/pin reset etc., looks good.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-23 09:57:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c15)) > MITRE assigned another two CVE names to this issue: [CVE-2009-4901](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4901) and > [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902).

Yes, these assignments are somewhat confusing.  Issue was originally reported and fixed upstream in 2009 (as mentioned in [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c7)), but they were only recognized as security fix in 2010, when [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) was assigned to all these issues.  Later on Mitre assigned [CVE-2009-4901](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4901) for one of the issues originally under [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407), apparently due to different impact (see [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c6)).  [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902) was also assigned for an incomplete fix for [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) (sic, different years make it even more confusing) in the upstream commit (see [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c7)), even though it's not clear if such incomplete fix was ever used in any upstream or vendor release.  Our updates addressing [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) will include complete fix that does not introduce [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902).  Statement CVE-2009-4902:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of pcsc-lite as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c21)  JJ Keijser    2010-06-24 09:23:14 UTC  ``` FYI: this security fix breaks Aladdin's pkiclient 5.0 on at least Fedora 12: With pcsc-lite-libs 1.5.2-3 installed I can use   pkcs11-tool --module /lib64/libeToken.so.5 -L without errors.

This is because the code is: 	if ((ctStr->cbRecvLength > sizeof(ctStr->cbRecvLength)) instead of: 	if ((ctStr->cbRecvLength > sizeof(ctStr->pbRecvBuffer))  ctStr->cbRecvLength is a uint32_t so sizeof returns 4. ctStr->pbRecvBuffer is the buffer.  So (nearly) any code that use SCardControl() will get an error. SCardControl() is used in particular with pinpad readers.  To know if the reported problem is the one I describe you should start pcscd in debug mode.

Ok, my comment was bad / confusing, I realized shorty after posting it.  Relevant change is from <= (i.e. rejecting all queries where specified attribute length is valid and not exceeding pbAttr size) to > (i.e. rejecting requests with excessive cbAttrLen length value).

If buffer is less than or equal to MAX_BUFFER_SIZE the patched in check in MSGFunctionDemarshall will fail with SCARD_E_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER.  case SCARD_GET_ATTRIB:   gsStr = ((getset_struct *) msgStruct->data);   rv = MSGCheckHandleAssociation(gsStr->hCard, dwContextIndex);   if (rv != 0) return rv;    /* avoids buffer overflow */   if (gsStr->cbAttrLen <= sizeof(gsStr->pbAttr))   {       gsStr->rv = SCARD_E_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER ;       break;   }   Case 2. If buffer is larger than MAX_BUFFER_SIZE the call fail in winscard_clnt.c:SCardGetSetAttrib instead. The result is SCARD_E_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER. (This case is not affected by the patch)  Case 3. If buffer is set to NULL to query required buffer size. SCardGetSetAttrib will set buffer size to MAX_BUFFER_SIZE and the call will fail as in case 1.  Not sure if this is the right bug to report this in or what the buffer size check is supposed to achieve but it will definitely make SCardGetAttrib defunct.   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c44)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-21 10:10:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #43](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c43)) > The patch pcsc-lite-1.5.2-overflow.patch in pcsc-lite-1.5.2-6.el6.src.rpm > breaks SCardGetAttrib on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. It will always return > SCARD_E_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER regardless of buffer size.  This is now corrected in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 via RHSA-2013:0525, see [bug 891852](show_bug.cgi?id=891852 "CLOSED ERRATA - pcsc-lite: incorrect check in SCardGetAttrib and SCardSetAttrib handling").  > Not sure if this is the right bug to report this in or what the buffer size > check is supposed to achieve but it will definitely make SCardGetAttrib > defunct.  Separate bug against affected component should be done to avoid having the report overlooked as happened in this case.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : pcsc-lite
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-0407

It was discovered that PCSCD, a daemon to access smart cards, was vulnerable
to a buffer overflow allowing a local attacker to elevate his privileges
to root.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
1.4.102-1+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pcsc-lite package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

CVE-2010-0839: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0840: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update
23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous
information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not
commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is related to
improper checks when executing privileged methods in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE), which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
via (1) an untrusted object that extends the trusted class but has not
modified a certain method, or (2) "a similar trust issue with interfaces,"
aka "Trusted Methods Chaining Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."
CVE-2010-0841: Unspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, and
1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow in the Java
Runtime Environment that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a JPEG image that contains subsample dimensions with large values,
related to JPEGImageReader and "stepX".
CVE-2010-0842: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is an uncontrolled array index that
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MIDI file with
a crafted MixerSequencer object, related to the GM\_Song structure.
CVE-2010-0843: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
claims from a reliable researcher that this is related to XNewPtr and
improper handling of an integer parameter when allocating heap memory
in the com.sun.media.sound libraries, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2010-0844: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is for improper parsing of a crafted
MIDI stream when creating a MixerSequencer object, which causes a pointer
to be corrupted and allows a NULL byte to be written to arbitrary memory.
CVE-2010-0846: Unspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25,
and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow
that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, related to an
"invalid assignment" and inconsistent length values in a JPEG image
encoder (JPEGImageEncoderImpl).
CVE-2010-0847: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java 2D component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25,
and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow
that allows arbitrary code execution via a crafted image.
CVE-2010-0848: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java 2D component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25,
and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0849: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java 2D component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25,
and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow
in a decoding routine used by the JPEGImageDecoderImpl interface, which
allows code execution via a crafted JPEG image.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
