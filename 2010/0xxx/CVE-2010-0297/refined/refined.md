  "CVE-2010-0297": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the USB passthrough handling code. A specially-crafted USB packet sent from inside a guest could be used to trigger a buffer overflow in the usb_host_handle_control() function, which runs under the QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest hang or crash) or possibly escalate their privileges within the host.",
    "Root cause": "A static buffer in `usb-linux.c` was too small to handle larger USB packets, leading to a buffer overflow when copying data into it.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (guest hang or crash), and potentially privilege escalation within the host.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious USB device attached to the host machine, either directly or via guest passthrough.",
      "A crafted USB packet sent from within a guest VM to trigger the overflow."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Physical access to plug in a USB device or access to libvirtd to attach a USB device",
      "Code execution within the guest VM, likely root access, to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
     "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs in `usb_host_handle_control()`, which is called by `do_token_in()` multiple times to handle larger USB packets. The initial buffer size was 1024 bytes which was not sufficient for some USB transfers. The fix increased the buffer size to 2048 to mitigate the issue."
