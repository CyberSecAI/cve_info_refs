Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the TYPO3 "openid" system extension handles OpenID authentication. Specifically, some OpenID providers discard the submitted OpenID identity during the authentication process and allow users to choose a different identity. This behavior allows an attacker to impersonate a valid backend user if they have an account at the same vulnerable provider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is an authentication bypass, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the TYPO3 backend.
- **Insecure OpenID Handling:** The "openid" extension doesn't properly validate the OpenID identity after it has been processed by the provider.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain full access to the TYPO3 backend with the privileges of the user they impersonated. This includes the ability to modify content, configurations, and potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the permissions of the compromised user, attackers can completely compromise the affected TYPO3 system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely by anyone with network access to the TYPO3 instance.
- **Specific OpenID Provider:** The attack requires both the attacker and the victim to have accounts at the same vulnerable OpenID provider which allows changing the submitted identity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Account at Vulnerable Provider:** The attacker needs an account with a specific type of OpenID provider that discards the submitted identity.
- **Knowledge of User's OpenID:** The attacker needs to know a victim's OpenID identity which is assigned to a TYPO3 user account.
- **TYPO3 "openid" Extension Enabled:** The "openid" system extension needs to be enabled on the target TYPO3 installation.

**Additional Details:**
- The "openid" extension is disabled by default, requiring manual configuration to enable it.
- The vulnerability is specific to TYPO3 version 4.3.0 with the "openid" extension enabled.
- TYPO3 version 4.3.1 fixes this vulnerability.
