{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Email clients and webmail services perform DNS prefetching of URLs found in the email body to improve loading speed. This behavior occurs even when remote image loading is disabled.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The DNS prefetching mechanism in email clients like Thunderbird and webmail services such as Gmail and Hotmail leaks information about email viewing. Specifically, a recipient's IP address can be exposed to a malicious sender via DNS lookups, even when remote images are disabled.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious sender can track when and from where an email was viewed by logging DNS queries for unique domains embedded within email URLs. This tracking occurs without the user's explicit action of clicking the links.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is sending an email containing URLs with unique domains. The attacker configures a DNS server to log all queries for those unique domains.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails and control a DNS server to log queries. The attacker also needs a method to correlate the DNS query logs to the emails sent. They also need to craft emails with unique domains for each recipient."
