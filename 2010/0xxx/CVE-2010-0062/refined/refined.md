Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow within the CoreMedia and QuickTime frameworks when handling H.263 encoded movie files. Specifically, the application miscalculates the buffer length when parsing sample data from a malformed .3g2 file utilizing the H.263 codec. This results in an under-allocated buffer. During decompression, the application overflows this buffer leading to code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a heap buffer overflow due to incorrect buffer size calculations when processing H.263 encoded movie files.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability is also due to a lack of proper validation of the H.263 encoded movie file data. This results in insufficient bounds checking allowing the overflow to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the currently logged-in user.
*   **Application Termination:** Viewing a maliciously crafted movie file may also lead to an unexpected application termination.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Movie Files:** Attackers can craft malicious H.263 encoded movie files (.3g2) designed to trigger the overflow.
*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can embed these malicious files on websites, so that when a victim visits the page or opens the malicious file, it triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, making it possible to exploit this vulnerability over a network.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, as the target user must either visit a malicious webpage or open the malicious file to trigger the exploit.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Damian Put and an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a Digital Vaccine protection filter with ID ['8438'].
*   Apple has released a security update to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects systems running Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.2, and Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.2.
