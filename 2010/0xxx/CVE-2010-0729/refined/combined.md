kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2010-0394 RHSA-2010-0424)

Original Release Date: June 21, 2010

Last Revised: March 26, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-146

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

\* RHSA-2009:1024 introduced a flaw in the ptrace implementation on Itanium
systems. ptrace\_check\_attach() was not called during certain ptrace()
requests. Under certain circumstances, a local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to call ptrace() on a process they do not own, giving them
control over that process. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-0729](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0729.html) to this issue.

\* a flaw was found in the kernel's Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
(ULE) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted ISO
MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) frame to a target system, resulting in a
denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1086](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1086.html) to this issue.

\* a use-after-free flaw was found in tcp\_rcv\_state\_process() in the
kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using IPv6 had
the IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote attacker
could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel panic.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1188](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1188.html) to this issue.

\* a divide-by-zero flaw was found in azx\_position\_ok() in the Intel High
Definition Audio driver, snd-hda-intel. A local, unprivileged user could
trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1085.html) to this issue.

\* an information leak flaw was found in the kernel's USB implementation.
Certain USB errors could result in an uninitialized kernel buffer being
sent to user-space. An attacker with physical access to a target system
could use this flaw to cause an information leak. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1083.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0394.html>

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0424.html>

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=572007#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-10 00:20:05 UTC  ``` (Internal git) Commit c31d1f3f363a5c3b6dbd4d6daa36fa0f4273e948 "a64: fix deadlock in ia64 sys_ptrace" moved ptrace_check_attach() from find_thread_for_addr() to tasklist-is-not-held area. However it introduced other problems.  In the likely case, when rbs_child == child, ptrace_check_attach() is never called. Otherwise we do ptrace_check_attach(rbs_child) twice. This means that any peek/poke request can silently fail and fool the tracer.  With this patch the logic is 	ptrace_check_attach(child);  	if (rbs_child != child) { 		// we should use rbs_child ... 		if (!ptrace_check_attach(rbs_child)) 			child = rbs_child;  		// but if check_attach() fails we continue to 		// use child, we are doing as well as we can. 	}  To simplify the error-handling and the logic, this patch changes the code to detect the likely rbs_child == child case earlier, right after find_thread_for_addr().  This only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=572007#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-10 00:31:56 UTC  ``` From Oleg, the problem is, ptrace_check_attach() also verifies the caller is the tracer and thus it have the rights to do "anything it wants" with the tracee.  But since ptrace_check_attach() can be missed, any user can do ptrace() on any target even without PTRACE_ATTACH.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=572007#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-05 13:05:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0394 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0394.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=572007#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-10 00:20:05 UTC  ``` (Internal git) Commit c31d1f3f363a5c3b6dbd4d6daa36fa0f4273e948 "a64: fix deadlock in ia64 sys_ptrace" moved ptrace_check_attach() from find_thread_for_addr() to tasklist-is-not-held area. However it introduced other problems.  In the likely case, when rbs_child == child, ptrace_check_attach() is never called. Otherwise we do ptrace_check_attach(rbs_child) twice. This means that any peek/poke request can silently fail and fool the tracer.  With this patch the logic is 	ptrace_check_attach(child);  	if (rbs_child != child) { 		// we should use rbs_child ... 		if (!ptrace_check_attach(rbs_child)) 			child = rbs_child;  		// but if check_attach() fails we continue to 		// use child, we are doing as well as we can. 	}  To simplify the error-handling and the logic, this patch changes the code to detect the likely rbs_child == child case earlier, right after find_thread_for_addr().  This only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=572007#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-10 00:31:56 UTC  ``` From Oleg, the problem is, ptrace_check_attach() also verifies the caller is the tracer and thus it have the rights to do "anything it wants" with the tracee.  But since ptrace_check_attach() can be missed, any user can do ptrace() on any target even without PTRACE_ATTACH.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=572007#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-05 13:05:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0394 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0394.html>   ``` |  |

Message-ID: <4B99E011.70303@kernel.sg>
Date: Fri, 12 Mar 2010 14:32:49 +0800
From: Eugene Teo <eugeneteo@...nel.sg>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
CC: coley@...us.mitre.org
Subject: CVE-2010-0729 kernel: ia64: ptrace: peek_or_poke requests miss ptrace_check_attach()

The "ia64: fix deadlock in ia64 sys_ptrace" patch (no reference as it's
only added in our shipped kernels) moved ptrace_check_attach() from
find_thread_for_addr() to tasklist-is-not-held area. However it
introduced other problems.

One of the problems is security-relevant. In certain code path, it is
possible that ptrace_check_attach() is not called, and the user can do
ptrace() on any target even without PTRACH_ATTACH.

This only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

Thanks, Eugene
