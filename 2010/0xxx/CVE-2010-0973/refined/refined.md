**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` file of the "PHPpool media Domain Verkaufs und Auktions Portal" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:**  An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including user information like usernames, passwords, and email addresses.
*   **Database Manipulation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection vulnerabilities can potentially be used to modify or delete data within the database, or execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with the `a` parameter set to `d` and a malicious `id` parameter.
*   **Malicious Input:** The `id` parameter is vulnerable and can accept SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need any special access to the server. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely using a web browser or other HTTP clients.
*   **Knowledge of Application:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL and parameter to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit example provided is:
    `http://www.site.com/portal/index.php?a=d&id=-11111111111+union+select+1,2,concat(firstname,0x3a,password,0x3a,email),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11+from+dsp_buyers--`
*   This specific exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `dsp_buyers` table.
