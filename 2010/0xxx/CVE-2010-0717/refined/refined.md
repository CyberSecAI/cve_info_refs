    "related": true,
    "summary": "The default configuration of cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded in MoinMoin does not prevent unsafe package actions.",
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from the MoinMoin configuration not adequately preventing unsafe actions related to package pages. Specifically, the default setting of `cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded` does not include all necessary restrictions, allowing for potentially harmful actions to be performed.\n\nThis is further detailed in the Debian Security Advisory DSA-2014-1, which states: \"The default configuration of cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded in MoinMoin does not prevent unsafe package actions.\"\n\nThe fix for this issue is mentioned in the MoinMoin 1.8.7 release notes which states \"Improved package security: cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded excludes unsafe or otherwise questionable package actions by default now.\"",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate access control",

    "impact": "This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary actions via package pages, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.",
