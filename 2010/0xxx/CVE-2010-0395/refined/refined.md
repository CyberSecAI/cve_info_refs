Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2010-0395 from the provided documents:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of Python macros embedded within office documents in OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice. Specifically, when using the built-in scripting IDE or macro browser to inspect Python code, OpenOffice and LibreOffice would execute the code even when macros were disabled.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unexpected Code Execution:** The core vulnerability lies in the unexpected execution of Python code when inspecting macros via the integrated IDE, even when macro execution was supposed to be disabled.
*   **Lack of Proper Handling of Python Macros:** OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice didn't properly handle and isolate Python macros when browsing their code, which bypasses intended security restrictions.
*   **Bypass of Macro Security Settings:** The vulnerability allowed the execution of macros regardless of user-defined security settings intended to block them.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the document. This could lead to a complete system compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly mentioned in all sources, execution under the user context could potentially be leveraged for further privilege escalation on the system depending on the specific user.
*   **Remote Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted document containing malicious macros. This could be achieved remotely by sending the document through email or hosting it on a malicious website.
*   **Denial of Service:** One source mentioned a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack as a possible consequence, though code execution seems to be the primary concern.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Documents:** Attackers can craft malicious ODT (OpenDocument Text) files containing Python macros that exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** Users need to be tricked into opening and inspecting the macro code within these specially crafted documents using the integrated scripting IDE or macro browser.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack Vector:** A remote attacker needs to entice a target user to open a specially crafted file using a vulnerable version of OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No specific authentication was required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Summary of Key Points Across Sources:**

*   **OpenOffice.org:**
    *   The vulnerability exists in all versions prior to 3.2.1 and all versions of OpenOffice.org 2
    *   The built-in scripting IDE and macro browser allows for unexpected code execution
    *   Workaround: Avoid inspecting Python code from untrusted documents using the built-in scripting IDE.
    *   Resolution: Update to OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 or later.
*   **Ubuntu:**
    *   OpenOffice.org would execute macros from the macro browser even when macros were disabled.
    *   A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges
    *   Affected Ubuntu versions: 10.04, 9.10, 9.04, and 8.04.
    *   Resolution: Update the openoffice.org packages to the specified versions in the provided text.
*   **Debian:**
    *   OpenOffice.org was not properly handling Python macros embedded in a document.
    *   This allows attacker to execute arbitrary code in the python macro viewer component with user assistance
    *   Affects stable (lenny) and unstable (sid) distributions.
    *   Resolution: Update openoffice.org packages to the versions mentioned.
*  **Red Hat:**
    *    CVE-2010-0395 allows execution of python code when browsing macros
    *   Fix was provided in RHSA-2010:0459
*   **Gentoo:**
    *   Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenOffice and LibreOffice, the worst of which may result in arbitrary code execution
    *   Resolution: Update to the latest version of OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or their binary counterparts.
*   **Secunia:**
    *   Provides information on the vulnerability within the context of their products: Software Vulnerability Research, Software Vulnerability Manager, Data Platform and Flexera One.
    *   Emphasizes that a specially crafted document is needed to trigger the vulnerability
*   **Oracle:**
     *   Oracle acknowledges that CVE-2010-0395 exists in "StarOffice, StarSuite"
*   **Apache:**
      *  Acknowledges the issue as CVE-2010-0395 affecting Apache OpenOffice

**Additional Notes:**

*   Several sources credit Marc Schoenefeld from Red Hat Security Response Team for discovering the vulnerability.
*   Multiple sources mention that this vulnerability is triggered by previewing macros, or inspecting code via scripting IDE and macro browser, which allows execution, regardless of macro disable settings.
*   Some sources mention the vulnerability could be used for denial of service although code execution seems to be the primary concern.

In summary, CVE-2010-0395 describes a vulnerability in OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice that allowed for the unintended execution of Python macros when browsing them, leading to the risk of arbitrary code execution through specially crafted document files. The primary attack vector requires social engineering of a victim to open such a file, and the resolution involves upgrading to patched versions.
