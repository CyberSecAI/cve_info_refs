  "CVE-2010-0112": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The ASP code in `IMAdminReportTrendFormRun.asp` lacks proper sanitization of the 'groupList' parameter, allowing for SQL injection.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary SQL into the backend database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or complete system compromise.",
      "Attack vectors": "By directly accessing the vulnerable page `IMAdminReportTrendFormRun.asp` and injecting malicious SQL code via the `groupList` parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "No authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
    },
    {
      "Root cause": "The `rdPageImlogic.aspx` page loads and executes SQL queries based on the `rdReport` argument which, when set to `DetailReportGroup`, loads the `DetailReportGroup.lgx` definition file. This file contains multiple parameters vulnerable to SQL injection.",
       "Weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary SQL statements on the backend database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or complete system compromise.",

      "Root cause": "The `rdpageimlogic.aspx` page does not properly filter the arguments to the parameters: 'selclause', 'whereTrendTimeClause', 'TrendTypeForReport', 'whereProtocolClause' and 'groupClause', allowing for SQL injection.",
       "Weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by injecting arbitrary SQL statements to be evaluated by the back-end database. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or complete system compromise.",
