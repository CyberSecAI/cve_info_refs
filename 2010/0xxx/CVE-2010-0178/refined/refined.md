Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0178:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of a browser applet (specifically a Java applet) to override the default mouse drag gesture recognizer. This allows an attacker to initiate a drag-and-drop action with only a mouse click, without requiring any actual mouse movement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Forced Drag and Drop:** The core vulnerability is that the browser can be manipulated into initiating a drag-and-drop operation without requiring the typical user interaction (mouse movement). This bypasses an expected user behavior.
2.  **Privilege Escalation via `chrome:` URL:**  By forcing a drag and drop of a `chrome:` URL, an attacker can gain access to privileged browser functionalities.
3.  **Arbitrary Script Execution via `javascript:` URL:** Once a `chrome:` URL is loaded, a second forced drag-and-drop, this time of a `javascript:` URL, allows the execution of arbitrary script with chrome privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the browser.  This could be used for malicious purposes including installing malware or stealing data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to execute javascript with chrome privileges allows for unauthorized manipulation of browser functionality

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious website containing a specially crafted Java applet.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires minimal user interaction: a series of clicks (the user has to click on the java applet) to initiate drag and drop actions and release the mouse button in the right place

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Web Content:** The attacker needs to host a webpage that includes a vulnerable Java applet.
*   **Understanding of Drag and Drop Mechanics:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate mouse events within a Java applet.
*   **Knowledge of `chrome:` and `javascript:` URLs:** The attacker has to be able to use those special URI to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within `nsDragAndDrop.js` in the Mozilla codebase.
*   The fix involves checking the `sourceDoc` of drag events to ensure they are valid, and using `file:///` as a fallback for cases where no source document is present.
*   The checkLoadURIStr function is used to prevent the load of privileged chrome URLs and is bypassed by the forced drag and drop.
*   The vulnerability was found on Windows XP, but potentially affects other operating systems where the vulnerability was not as easily exploitable

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is more easily exploitable on Windows where a drag-and-drop action can be triggered only by click, while a real mouse drag is necessary on Linux.
*   The vulnerability could also be used to load malicious `file://` URIs, but this was deemed less of an immediate issue.
*   The vulnerability also affects Firefox's use of Xulrunner.
*   The vulnerability affects Firebug add-on due to `XMLHttpRequestSpy` module.
