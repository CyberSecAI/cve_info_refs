  "CVE-2010-0821": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because of the way that Microsoft Office Excel parses the Excel file format when opening a specially crafted Excel file, specifically during the parsing of SXVIEW records, where insufficient checks allow writing arbitrary data to a user-controlled address.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper parsing of Excel file format",
      "Lack of bounds checking during parsing of structure items for SXVIEW records",
      "Ability to write arbitrary data to a user-controlled address"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vector": "Opening a specially crafted Excel file via email or website.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires crafting a malicious Excel file with a specially crafted SXVIEW record. No authentication is needed, but user interaction (opening the file) is required.",
