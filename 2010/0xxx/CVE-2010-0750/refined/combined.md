| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=26982#c0)  Dan Rosenberg    2010-03-09 11:17:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 33901](attachment.cgi?id=33901 "Patch for pkexec info disclosure") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=33901&action=edit "Patch for pkexec info disclosure") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=26982&attachment=33901) Patch for pkexec info disclosure  pkexec is vulnerable to a minor information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker to verify whether or not arbitrary files exist, violating directory permissions. I reproduced the issue on my Karmic installation as follows:  $ mkdir secret $ sudo chown root:root secret $ sudo chmod 400 secret $ sudo touch secret/hidden $ pkexec /home/drosenbe/secret/hidden (password prompt) $ pkexec /home/drosenbe/secret/doesnotexist Error getting information about /home/drosenbe/secret/doesnotexist: No such file or directory  I've attached my patch for the issue. I replaced the stat() call entirely with access() using F_OK, so rather than check that the target exists, pkexec now checks if the user has permission to verify the existence of the program. There might be another way of doing this, such as chdir()'ing to the parent directory of the target and calling lstat(), but this seemed like more code than necessary to prevent such a minor problem.  I see no reason to allow pkexec to execute targets that are not accessible to the executing user because of directory permissions. This is such a limited use case anyway that this doesn't really affect functionality. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=26982#c1)  David Zeuthen (not reading bugmail)    2010-03-10 09:48:49 UTC  ``` Nice catch, committed.  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/PolicyKit/commit/?id=14bdfd816512a82b1ad258fa143ae5faa945df8a>  Thanks. ``` |  |

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

in pkexec, which has been fixed[[2]](#2) upstream.  It would disclose the
existence of files a given user would normally not be able to confirm:

$ pkexec /home/drosenbe/secret/hidden
(password prompt)
$ pkexec /home/drosenbe/secret/doesnotexist
Error getting information about /home/drosenbe/secret/doesnotexist: No such file or directory

Thanks,

-Kees

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: policykit-1

pkexec is vulnerable to a minor information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker to verify whether or not arbitrary files exist, violating directory permissions. I reproduced the issue on my Karmic installation as follows:

$ mkdir secret

$ sudo chown root:root secret

$ sudo chmod 400 secret

$ sudo touch secret/hidden

$ pkexec /home/drosenbe/secret/hidden

(password prompt)

$ pkexec /home/drosenbe/secret/doesnotexist

Error getting information about /home/drosenbe/secret/doesnotexist: No such file or directory

I've attached a simple patch that resolves the issue by using access() to check whether or not the user has permission to verify the existence of the file before calling stat() on it.

Come to think of it, please ignore that patch. A determined attacker could exploit the race condition between the access() and stat() calls. I'll revisit this and produce a better patch within the next couple of days.

Patch for pkexec info disclosure

pkexec is vulnerable to a minor information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker to verify whether or not arbitrary files exist, violating directory permissions. I reproduced the issue on my Karmic installation as follows:

$ mkdir secret

$ sudo chown root:root secret

$ sudo chmod 400 secret

$ sudo touch secret/hidden

$ pkexec /home/drosenbe/secret/hidden

(password prompt)

$ pkexec /home/drosenbe/secret/doesnotexist

Error getting information about /home/drosenbe/secret/doesnotexist: No such file or directory

I've attached my patch for the issue. I replaced the stat() call entirely with access() using F\_OK, so rather than check that the target exists, pkexec now checks if the user has permission to verify the existence of the program. There might be another way of doing this, such as chdir()'ing to the parent directory of the target and calling lstat(), but this seemed like more code than necessary to prevent such a minor problem. I see no reason to allow pkexec to execute targets that are not accessible to the executing user because of directory permissions. This is such a limited use case anyway that this doesn't really affect functionality.

Hi Dan,

Thanks for looking at this. It would be great if you could take this issue

to the developers of the software at

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/>

and discuss the patch with them.

I would be happy to do this for you, but it would be much more efficient for

you to do it.

Thanks,

James

Security team,

the upstream fix is straightforward enough. Do you need me to prepare a debdiff, or do you want to apply/upload this yourself?

# PolicyKit: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201204-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in PolicyKit, the worst of
which may allow a local attacker to gain root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-auth/polkit** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.104-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.104-r1** |

### Background

PolicyKit is a toolkit for controlling privileges for system-wide
services.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in PolicyKit:

* Error messages in the pkexec utility disclose the existence of local
  files (CVE-2010-0750).
* The pkexec utility initially checks the effective user ID of its
  parent process for authorization, instead of checking the real user ID
  (CVE-2011-1485).
* Members of the "wheel" group are able to execute commands as an
  administrator without a password (CVE-2011-4945).

### Impact

A local attacker could gain elevated privileges or sensitive
information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PolicyKit users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/polkit-0.104-r1"

```
