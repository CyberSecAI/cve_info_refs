How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# 05 Mar 2010: My wifes alarm clock kept me awake at night

![](/mark/talks/20100305.gif)
And not because she's set the alarm for the wrong time, or used a
'crazy frog' sound theme, but because it had a remote root exploit.
It's fixed now.

It all started when I bought her a Chumby for Christmas. A Chumby
is a little bedside device that can act as an alarm clock as well as
running flash-lite applets. What made it especially appealing is that
you can write your own applets if you want, and the whole thing is
Linux-based and designed to be hackable: they correctly abide by the
GPL and have their sources available, you can build and install your
own software, you can even enable ssh and have a remote shell if you
want to. And with NTP the clock is always at the right time, since
I really don't like having out-of-sync clocks around the house.

So it was time to connect another device to my wireless network: a
device designed to be left on and permanently connected to the
network, and having a connected microphone, in the bedroom. A quick
look around the OS and I found that it had a web server accessible by
default, and a pair of CGI scripts, written in shell script, running
as root, that didn't correctly escape their input. (Hint: writing
secure CGI scripts in shell is non-trivial).

With a bit of careful manipulation (to get around some character
handling in the code) I had a remote root shell on a default Chumby and
could stream audio from the microphone remotely. Oops. Not too big a
deal though as it's unlikely you're going to have it directly
connected to the internet, although with some social engineering, if
you know someone with a Chumby, you could do a cunning cross-site
scripting attack and get a reverse shell that way.

I contacted the Chumby folks and they dealt with this like an ideal
vendor; acknowledging the issue, keeping in contact, and doing [a security update](https://www.chumby.com/pages/release10mar).
Good for them. I like this device and vendor so much I'm going to buy
another Chumby, and a few colleagues from work are too.

But how many other devices do we connect to our networks without
thinking about them, and how many folks outside of the security
paranoid have properly secured and segmented wireless networks? I've
got a IP wireless network CCTV camera and a VOIP phone system both
which seem to be running Linux (and both which seem to have
vulnerabilities) to worry about next although harder since both are
closed systems which haven't released their source.

So for CVE database: CVE-2010-0418 is *"Chumby One before 1.0.4 and
Chumby Classic before 1.7.2 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a carefully crafted
request to the web interface".* Reported 29 Dec 2009, vendor responded
29 Dec 2009, tested fix 3 Feb 2010, public and updates 4 Mar 2010.
