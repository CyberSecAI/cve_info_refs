{
  "Root cause": "The application has insufficient input sanitization leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Database Backup Dump: The application exposes a database backup file directly.",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI): The application allows inclusion of arbitrary local files via the 'page' parameter."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": [
    "Database Backup Dump: Exposure of sensitive database information.",
    "Local File Inclusion:  Attackers can potentially read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration or system files."
  ],
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Database Backup Dump: Accessing the backup.sql file directly through a web browser.",
    "Local File Inclusion: Crafting a URL with a malicious value for the 'page' parameter."
  ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable ZeusCMS instance."
