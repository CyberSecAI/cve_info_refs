Forged to be secure
[SHOP HARD](/en/usb-flash-drives/encrypted)

# Don't let your data be a soft target.

Only hardware encryption gives your data the defence it deserves. Fortunately, the on-the-go secure storage solutions by Kingston IronKey™ don’t have any soft edges.

#### Non-encrypted drives

When data is taken outside of the office, your existing cybersecurity and data loss prevention policies can no longer keep you safe, making your data a soft target. Luckily IronKey drives provide on-the-go file storage with the ultimate portable security strategy.

#### Software-encrypted drives

The hard truth is that software-based encryption isn't enough. While it has its advantages, it may not match its perception as being comprehensive. It's only as secure as the device it is used on. In contrast, hardware-based encryption offers a more robust solution. So, if you’re only software-secure, it’s time to harden defences.

#### Cloud storage

The cloud is not under your control. With unlimited password attempts, your files can continuously get attacked. Fortunately, IronKey devices meet the toughest security and compliance standards.

## Give your data a HARD defence.

## Ask an expert

Planning the right solution requires an understanding of your project's security goals. Let Kingston's experts guide you on how to best defend your sensitive data.

![Why choose IronKey](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/IronKey_promo_why_choose-lg.jpg "Why choose Kingston IronKey")

## Why choose Kingston IronKey™?

With the power and pedigree of Kingston Technology forged into every product, trust that your data is truly secure when it’s secured by Kingston IronKey.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/data-protection.svg)
#### Hardware-encrypted storage options for data protection

Safeguard important data with FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified, FIPS 197 certified and XTS-AES 256-bit encryption capable devices. Additionally, there are built-in protections against BadUSB and brute force attacks.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/Ironkey-user-pin.svg)
#### Multi-password option for data recovery

Enable Admin, User and One-Time Recovery passwords. Admin can reset a User password and create a One-Time Recovery password to restore User’s access to data. Brute force attack protection locks out User or One-Time Recovery passwords if 10 invalid passwords are entered in a row, and crypto-erases the drive if the Admin password is entered incorrectly 10 times in a row.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/ironkey_passphrase_mode.svg)
#### Passphrase mode

Select between Complex or Passphrase password mode. Passphrases can be a numeric PIN, sentence with space characters, list of words or even lyrics – from 10 to 64 characters long.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/dual-read-only.svg)
#### Dual read-only (write-protect) settings

Avoid malware attacks with a forced Read-Only mode set by Admin for User, or a session based Read-Only mode set by Admin or User.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/locally-manage.svg)
#### Locally manage drives for small and medium businesses

Use Admin role to locally manage employee User and One-Time Recovery passwords, recover data access on locked drives, and comply with laws and regulations when forensics are required.

## IronKey origins

IronKey Inc. was an internet security and data privacy company established in 1996. IronKey received a grant from the US Department of Homeland Security in 2004 to develop a secure, tamper-resistant USB Flash drive, primarily for use by the US government and military. The IronKey brand soon grew quickly as the need for secure portable devices became evident: the biggest security threat to corporate and government users was the frequent loss or theft of data stored on USB drives.

In 2016, Kingston Technology, which had been manufacturing and delivering hardware-encrypted products since 2007, purchased IronKey. “Kingston IronKey” was born – and became the largest, best-known maker of hardware-encrypted USB drives in the world..

    Only? It's \*mainly\* defects in the rest of the system that tend to bring things down.

    Algorithms, once they get to the point where the experts trust them, are very seldom broken in the everything-laid-completely-bare way that faulty system design gets you. It's usually more like "could be broken with a week of supercomputing time ten years from now" or "can calculate a hash collision for certain specially constructed messages" variety of crack.

    Of course once you get to that point, you have to assume that some really bright people will find a way to generalize the fault in the algorithm. If they'd broken AES, or even found an unexpected weakness in it, that'd be \*huge\* news. Instead, what they've found appears to be a classic case of plain old brain damaged design.

    If the article is to be believed, the researchers found a really, really stupid flaw, the kind a non-expert like I could understand and probably exploit with not much effort. I would paraphrase this way: all these drives \*effectively\* have exactly the same key, but that fact is obscured by the software.

    These aren't disks, they're USB thumb drives. The folks who "cracked" it just figured out a way to bypass the password and send a specific string that ALL of these devices use to access the data on these USB thumb drives. This seems to be endemic to these things. The info isn't encrypted, it's just locked with a password.

        If it was properly encrypted, the decryption would be carried out on the device using a key supplied by the host PC and the device wouldn't be physically capable of decrypting it without the key. As it stands, the most charitable reading of this is that it **IS** using AES encryption, but it always uses the exact same key regardless of what the enduser does in the software.

    If you set up Truecrypt in portable-mode on a USB key so it acts like these off-the-shelf keys, then it needs administrator privileges to work. That's a big problem for a lot of people.

    Portable Truecrypt has problems. The user will import their private key or at least have it somewhere they can get to it or use conventional cryptography. So there's a lot of security vulnerabilities right there. Oh, forgot to delete your private key? Now Im cracking the conventional encryption that protects it. TrueCrypt portable requierd admin privs:

    The idea with these drives is that the app can be run from the drive itself, so no extra software or training is needed. No key management. So that really just leaves us conventional cryptography, not public/private key. The problem of having security on your USB drive that gets plugged into various computers that you might not have control over and may be running trojans is tough to solve. Application level encryption is probably the best way to go but it requires standard installs and trust of the host computer.

    Youre better off just carrying a netbook or other trusted security device with an encrypted drive and sharing the files via conventional methods with the host without giving the host all your data - email, ftp, web, plaintext transfers, etc.

    IronKey D200 and S200 models are validated to the much more demanding FIPS 140-2 Level 3. The products that are the subject of this hack are validated to Level 2. They are all in fact manufactured by SanDisk.
    Previous authors are correct, their architecture has serious design flaws. They are relying on the host PC to do password verification, and essentially using a static code to tell the device to unlock. Basically it's a back door to all of those affected SanDisk, Kingston and Verbatim devices.
    I will be posting an FAQ later today on the [https://www.ironkey.com/](https://www.ironkey.com/ "ironkey.com") [ironkey.com] website describing the flaws and how IronKey's architecture does not have these issues.
    IronKey validates all passwords in hardware. We have password replay prevention and encrypted USB command channels. We also use a hash of the password to decrypt the data AES key, so it's cryptographically impossible to unlock an IronKey without the password. Finally, IronKeys store encryption keys and brute force counters in a hardened CryptoChip. The SanDisk, Kingston and Verbatim products store them in Flash memory, which isn't even part of their FIPS 140-2 security policy.

    No, it's not. If the hardware gives up the data without requiring the encryption key, the hardware is flawed.

    First, here's the [NIST list of approved 140-1 and 140-2 modules](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm "nist.gov") [nist.gov].

    Note that they approve the module and not the access software. The flaw is in the access software. Therefore, 140-2 compliance or approval isn't proof that your data is safe. It just means that some approved form of encryption is implemented by the crypto module. It appears that the modules in question were given some form of TEMPEST examination as well, but once again, that means nothing in terms of the access software.

    Actually, the flaw is indeed in the modules. They ALL use they same unlock key. I'd say that makes them flawed. The software is not helpful - it just obscures the fact that they all use the same unlock key by asking for a unique password that it converts to the common unlock key - but as unhelpful as the software is, it isn't the issue.

    To put it another way, there is no way of fixing the software to change the fact that all of these drives can be accessed with one known key, which means its not the software that is broken, its the keys.

    Of course, it doesn't help that the software gave up that key, so that is certainly a flaw but if the modules all had different keys it wouldn't be as helpful and it certainly isn't as big as a problem as the modules all being the same!

  I don't believe why any portable secure drive needs to or should trust its host computer. This is a particularly stupid implementation, with an obvious and blatant exploit. But the host computer could by definition be compromised, and could intercept or store / cache or misbehave generically with the password you enter to get in.

  Put a thumb-key sized numeric or hex keypad on the device, and make the owner punch in the code on insertion into a host device. One could still physically break into and tap the keys somehow, if the device is stolen and then returned without the owner knowing, but the user interface moves to right next to the data...

  As someone who works in the secure flash drive space, maybe I can shed a little light on some questions/comments I see above..

  First and foremost the vulnerability described in this article is related to only the secure flash drives stated in TFA. There are several others available that do not have this vulnerability because instead of password matching in software, they match in Hardware of Firmware, run on the drive itself. Are there others within the industry that may be susceptible? Probably, but all secure flash drives certainly are not. Look to only use drives with password matching done on-chip (HW/FW).

  How could a FIPS 140-2 certified flash drive have this vulnerability? Well FIPS is great to prove you use certified encryption algorithms, authentication methods, and so on, but FIPS does not certify the whole system. This is one of those very important security areas that fall outside of the FIPS umbrella. In the future look for additional certifications that will encompass the entire system rather than just the encryption like FIPS..

  Why not just use TrueCrypt?? TrueCrypt is a great product, there is no doubt. But at its core, TrueCrypt is a software encryption container for your data. There are some inherent shortcomings with software encryption on USB flash drives.

  1. Performance is sacrificed since your PC CPU needs to perform all security operations in software, rather than on the hardware of the flash drive.

  2. Though it may work well for consumers that \*want\* to have their data secure, TrueCrypt would be a nightmare in an enterprise setting. Users could format the drive, or store files outside of the encrypted partition just to make things easier. This is not possible on secure flash drives with forced data encryption via hardware. with these drives an Admin knows that if he sees a drive by company X, that the data on it must be secure.
  Just to name a couple..

  I hope this is helpful to some.

    What I got from the article was the following scenario:
    1. Drive asks for a password
    2. User enters a password
    3a. The password is incorrect -> "DO NOT OPEN" message is sent to the drive
    3b. The password is correct -> "OPEN" message is sent to the drive
    4. User gains access to the drive

    The "crackers" simply bypassed steps 1 and 2 and went straight to 3b. You'd of course have to be a complete idiot to design an authenticating mechanism in this manner. TrueCrypt does not share this design.

      If you were to check the flash drives partitioning, you'll see that it has two separate partitions. The section with encryption program is on the primary partition of the flash drive. When the program executes, you get access to the other partition.

      Now I've mounted those drives under Linux by bypassing the login process. Instead of mounting sdc1 (assuming sdc is your encrypted flash drive), you mount sdc2. What I've learnt is that the drive isn't encrypted at all - nor password protected. If you can find a way to format the first partition, you pretty much kill the password protection that comes with the flash drive. The "protected" partition just becomes the default partition when the primary one is unavailable.

      TrueCrypt or any other data encryption method is the right way to actually secure your data

        IF in fact what you've discovered is true across several vendors "FIPS certified" flash drives, then I'm not sure what is more disturbing; The idiot who designed this "encryption" scheme, or the idiot in charge of rubber stamping the FIPS certification on it.

        I knew there was more than one reason I use TrueCrypt everywhere...

      Strongly agreed! This tells me that none of those vendors can be trusted. NIST also cannot be trusted.

      That sort of snake oil is way too common in "secure" USB drives. The first one I personally tested was equally bad. It supposedly used fingerprints to secure the data. It did in a sense, but an incorrect fingerprint just caused the drive to claim it was smaller than it actually was. It would happily allow you to read those sectors past the reported "end of disk" though, so it wasn't exactly secure. The vend

    There's a difference between a "tiny vulnerability" and a "hole a blind man could drive an 18-wheeler through". This one is in the latter category.

        As far as I can see, the main threats to be protected against for an encrypted USB drive are

        1) Misplacing the drive and having some random ne'er do well find it and read the data off of it.
        2) Having a co-worker, family member or other person with occasional physical access to the drive read the data off of it.

        This hole means the encryption substantially fails to protect against either threat

    Um, she should be concerned. WEP might as well be an open access point, in which case anyone can sniff anything that goes over it unencrypted. All it takes is one person to sniff her email password over the WiFi and they can cause all sorts of headaches.

    What you don't need to do is explain it to her. Just say "WEP is obsolete garbage, trust me".
