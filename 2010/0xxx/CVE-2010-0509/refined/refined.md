- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A privilege escalation issue exists in `SFLServer`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SFLServer runs as group 'wheel' and accesses files in users' home directories, which allows a local user to escalate privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user may be able to obtain elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
