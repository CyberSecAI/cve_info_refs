  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The provided content indicates the presence of multiple vulnerabilities in Acidcat CMS v3.5, but does not specify the exact root cause for each. It does mention potential exploits related to access to the database file and the installation script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The content mentions two specific vulnerabilities:\n  - Direct access to the database file:  `http://server/[dizin]/databases/acidcat_3.mdb`.\n  - Direct access to the installation script: `http://server/[dizin]/install.asp`.\nThese indicate a lack of access control and improper security configuration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of the database file could lead to complete information disclosure, potentially including sensitive data such as user credentials, application settings, and other confidential information. Access to the installation script may allow a malicious actor to potentially re-install the application, overwrite existing data, and potentially gain unauthorized access or control of the application or server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attack vectors are accessing the database file and the installation script through direct web requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know or discover the paths to the vulnerable database file (`acidcat_3.mdb`) and installation script (`install.asp`) on a server running the vulnerable Acidcat CMS v3.5 application. No authentication is required for these particular exploits."
