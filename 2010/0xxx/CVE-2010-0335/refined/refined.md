**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, or execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malware distribution.
*   **Information Disclosure / Path Traversal:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive files or directories on the server that they are not authorized to view, potentially revealing system information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors vary depending on the vulnerability type. SQL injection typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in database queries, while XSS often involves injecting malicious code through user-supplied inputs. Information disclosure / path traversal vulnerabilities arise from insecure handling of file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For SQL injection and XSS, attackers would generally need to find vulnerable input fields, parameters or access points within the web application. They would need some understanding of the application and its interactions with the database or frontend. For path traversal, attackers need to manipulate file paths to access restricted areas on the server.

**Mitigation:**

*   The document recommends that users update vulnerable extensions to the patched versions or remove the extension if no patch is available. If updates are not available, and the author of the extension is not responsive, the extensions should be uninstalled.
*   It also recommends following the guidelines in the TYPO3 Security Cookbook.
