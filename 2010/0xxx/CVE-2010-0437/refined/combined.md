Subject: CVE request - kernel: ip6_dst_lookup_tail() NULL pointer dereference

ipv6: Fix OOPS in ip6_dst_lookup_tail().

This fixes kernel bugzilla 11469: "TUN with 1024 neighbours:
ip6_dst_lookup_tail NULL crash"

dst->neighbour is not necessarily hooked up at this point in the
processing path, so blindly dereferencing it is the wrong thing to do.
This NULL check exists in other similar paths and this case was just an
oversight.

Also fix the completely wrong and confusing indentation here while we're
at it.

```
```

3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.

```
```
 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.
```
```
    VMware would like to thank Claudio Criscione of Secure Networking
    for reporting this issue to us.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I just failed to copy the very first crash trace.  Likely it will not help, since subsequent crashes are results of the first one and rarely contain good info, but dump you have presented is not tainted, so problem is not in some other place. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=11469#c5)  Evgeniy Polyakov    2008-09-07 11:11:58 UTC  ``` Hi.

Since dst entry is allowed not to have neighbour entry, flush it just like with incomplete one. This drops performance of your application with more than 1024 neighbours to 1024 messages, to fix it you should tune ipv6 routing parameters (gc intervals, gc threshold, maximum number of entries and so on). There may be another problem with perfomance though, at least I was able to bump it 10 times with different settings, but still two times smaller than with 4k neighbours.

Well, yes. The whole 'optimistic' dad looks a bit suspicious. I think failed dst entry without neighbour is a result of the 'static' dst entry returned by the above route lookup and previously neighbour was not used at all. This patch fixes the opps, but may be just hiding a problem, but reading how this optimistic duplicate address detection works, I see no strict requirements that returned route entry has to have neighbour, so this check actually can be a right fix.  I've added Neil Horman, who created the patch 1.5 years ago, to the copy list. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=11469#c9)  Neil Horman    2008-09-09 03:58:40 UTC  ``` On Tue, Sep 09, 2008 at 12:34:18AM +0400, Evgeniy Polyakov wrote: > Hi David. >  > On Mon, Sep 08, 2008 at 01:15:47PM -0700, David Miller (davem@davemloft.net) > wrote: > > But I don't like this patch for several reasons: > >  > > 1) Slapping on a NULL check in response to a OOPS at that exact > >    location is usually a very big red flag, and deserves high scrutiny > >    instead of blind acceptance. > >  > > 2) Looking at the indentation of this DAD code block (it's all one tab > >    too much) it's obviously a very shitty cut and paste job.

Regardless, making sure we have one by explicitly checking the pointer seems like the right thing to do.  As Evgeniy noted, the Optimistic DAD code provides no explicit guarantee that we have a neigh entry for this dst. We just want to be sure we forward packets to an incomplete neighbour that is marked as optimistic to the router.  We already do this dst->neighbour NULL check in many other locations (giving us precident, see ip6_output_finish and ip6_forward as just a few examples).  I think its right to do the same check in the Optimistic DAD code.  I just never hit it in my testing since its an uncommon case.   As for the indentation, I'm pretty sure this was the only point I wrote/used this code, so I'm loathe to believe that the indentation was a cut and paste error.  Unfortunately, that just implies it was my own stupidity and poor eyesight that created that uglynesss.  Apologies Dave, I'll submit a patch shortly to correct that.

Sorry. >  > Signed-off-by: Neil Horman <nhorman@tuxdriver.com>  Applied with the following commit message.  I'll queue this up for -stable as well.  Thanks!  ipv6: Fix OOPS in ip6_dst_lookup_tail().  This fixes kernel bugzilla 11469: "TUN with 1024 neighbours: ip6_dst_lookup_tail NULL crash"  dst->neighbour is not necessarily hooked up at this point in the processing path, so blindly dereferencing it is the wrong thing to do.  This NULL check exists in other similar paths and this case was just an oversight.  Also fix the completely wrong and confusing indentation here while we're at it.  Based upon a patch by Evgeniy Polyakov.  Signed-off-by: Neil Horman <nhorman@tuxdriver.com> Signed-off-by: David S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=563781#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-02-11 05:03:09 UTC  ``` Description of problem: ipv6: Fix OOPS in ip6_dst_lookup_tail().  This fixes kernel bugzilla 11469: "TUN with 1024 neighbours: ip6_dst_lookup_tail NULL crash"  dst->neighbour is not necessarily hooked up at this point in the processing path, so blindly dereferencing it is the wrong thing to do.  This NULL check exists in other similar paths and this case was just an oversight.  Also fix the completely wrong and confusing indentation here while we're at it.  Based upon a patch by Evgeniy Polyakov.  References: <http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11469>  Upstream patch: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/e550dfb0c2c31b6363aa463a035fc9f8dcaa3c9b>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=563781#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-02-11 05:13:57 UTC  ``` How to mitigate against NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities? <http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20536>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=563781#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 00:19:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0147 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0147.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=563781#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 03:18:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2010:0148 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0148.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=563781#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-17 04:03:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3.Z - Server Only  Via RHSA-2010:0149 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0149.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=563781#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-23 15:42:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0161 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0161.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
