  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient domain name validation in getPlus ActiveX control.",
      "weaknesses": "The getPlus ActiveX control validates the domain in the URL by checking if it ends with `.adobe.com`. However, the validation logic fails to account for cases where the URL does not point to a subdomain, allowing for the use of arbitrary domains ending with `adobe.com`, such as `xadobe.com`, `aadobe.com`, etc., by an attacker.",
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to distribute and execute arbitrary malicious software by registering a domain name like `xadobe.com` and luring a vulnerable user to visit a malicious website. By controlling the download URL, the attacker can bypass security checks and install malware.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves luring a vulnerable user to visit a malicious website that uses a specially crafted URL with the vulnerable getPlus ActiveX control to download and execute malicious software.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to register a domain ending in `adobe.com`, such as `xadobe.com`, and host a malicious website. The attacker also needs to create a crafted URL to exploit the vulnerability in the getPlus ActiveX control. The attacker must also lure the user to visit the malicious website.",
       "additonal_details": "The vulnerability lies in the flawed domain validation function (isDomainValid) within the getPlus ActiveX control. The function parses the URL, extracts the domain, and compares it against a hardcoded value. However it performs a flawed check to see if a domain is a sub-domain or not by comparing the pointers before and after a string comparison. The flaw is that this allows for domain names that start with an arbitrary character such as `xadobe.com` to pass domain verification. The function checks if the character preceding the matched domain (`adobe.com` in this instance) is a dot, intended to ensure the validated domain is a subdomain. This check is skipped for strings of the form `xadobe.com`, allowing a malicious domain to be used. \n\n The parameters in the object tag example in the content specify the URL,  `http://get.adobe.com/reader/webservices/dlm/`, which serves as the base for fetching additional parameters. getPlus then appends other params to this url before downloading the configuration parameters. The parameter *object_url* within the config contains the actual link to the file that has to be downloaded, and this is where an attacker could inject a URL to a malicious executable. \n\n The executables downloaded by getPlus are compressed using a technology called NOSSO. When executed, this compressed data is loaded in memory within a segment called *.nos*. This segment is where the vulnerability exists.\n"
