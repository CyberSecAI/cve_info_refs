Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-0059:

**Root Cause:**
- A memory corruption issue exists in the handling of QDM2 encoded audio content within Apple's CoreAudio framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability arises from a buffer overflow. During the rendering of a QDesign audio stream, an allocation is made using a field from the sample's description, but a different length is used when initializing the buffer. This discrepancy in lengths causes the overflow.
- **Memory Corruption:** This overflow leads to memory corruption, making it possible for malicious code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the currently logged-in user.
- **Application Termination:** It can also cause an unexpected application termination if the attacker does not inject malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Audio Content:** The primary attack vector is through the use of maliciously crafted QDM2 encoded audio content. This content could be embedded in a file or accessed via a website.
- **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create or have access to malicious QDM2 encoded audio content.
- The attacker needs to find a way to deliver this content to the target user through a malicious file or by hosting it on a website the user is likely to visit.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.2 and Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a digital vaccine filter (ID 9431).
- Apple addressed this issue in Security Update 2010-002/ Mac OS X v10.6.3 by implementing improved bounds checking.

The information from the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) provides a more detailed description of the root cause than the Apple advisory, specifying the allocation and initialization length discrepancy.
