Samba Remote Directory Traversal
logic fuckup discovered & exploited by Kingcope in 2010

It seems there was a quite similar bug found back in 2004:
<http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=109658688505723&w=2>

A remote attacker can read, list and retrieve nearly all files on the System \
remotely. Required is a valid samba account for a share which is writeable OR
a writeable share which is configured to be a guest account share,
in this case this is a preauth exploit.

The attacker can write for example into /tmp or where the account
he is connecting with has access to (/home/<user> etc).

Exploit session (using the patched smbclient exploit):

smb is a samba user created.

No, it's actually incorrect. If "wide links = no", then no
one can ever access anything off share, and so UNIX symlinks
should be allowed to point to anywhere they like, as UNIX
clients will follow them locally, not on the server.

Nope - see above :-).

Imagine an app running on a Linux client that needs a symlink
to /usr/local/lib inside it's filespace (don't know why, but
it might :-). If that app is run off a CIFSFS share creating
the /usr/local/lib symlink would fail with "wide links = no",
which is not what you want.

Yes, I think this is fair game for CVE.

Use CVE-2010-0926, to be filled in later.

i think this should get a CVE.  "wide links = no" is not really a
hardening feature.  it is a solution for a certain subset of samba
users [[0]](#0).  many will need to set "wide links = yes" (in order to
use symlinks to local files) and will remain vulnerable.

besides, the Confidentiality Impact and Integrity Impact are rather
high since pretty much any file on the victim's system can be read
(confidentiality) and /tmp and other locations are writeable
(integrity).

that's a very good example.  would it be wrong to dictate that local
paths must be hardcoded, rather than symlinked (or manually symlinked
by the samba server administrator)?

Correct.

I'm making a code change that will disallow "wide links = yes"
to be set on a share is "unix extensions = yes". That should
address any root cause.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

As many of you have probably seen, there was a supposed Samba 0day flaw
posted to full-disclosure and youtube.

Samba has a response to this:
<http://marc.info/?l=samba-technical&m=126539387432412&w=2>

I'm not sure if this should get a CVE id. It is documented behavior.
Somewhat unexpected though. I think changing the default is the right way
to go, but it may be more of a hardening measure than a security fix.

Thoughts Steve?

Thanks.

As far as I read, the current situation comes down to 2 options.

1- "unix extensions = no", "wide links = yes"

With these options set, a samba administrator can link a directory (say
/usr/lib) on a samba share and users can see it. However, users can not link
anything. Even inside a samba share.

2- "unix extensiosn = yes", "wide links = no"

Symbolic linking is completely disabled. Even if a samba administrator links a
directory, users cannot follow symbolic links nor they can create.

It would be feature-complete for users and administrators to control whether a
remote user is trying to link outside his share because a user might want to
link a directory in his own share, and an administrator might want to link a
directory for users inside their shares.

I'm sure Samba team is working on it. However, I don't know how Samba
developers are treating this issue. In my humble opinion, this issue deserves
high priority.

I would be happy if I can learn when Samba team will respond to this issue
with a patch. Although setting proper configuration solves the issue, applying
proper fix without breaking anything would be appreciative.

My best regards,
Eren

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

That code already exists and will be turned on when "wide links = no"
is set.

The problem is that's not what you want. There are valid reasons
for Linux / UNIX clients to create symlinks on a remote file system
that point to local files (/etc/passwd).

In the short term, "wide links = no" is what you need. I'm
addressing this in code (correct parameter checks) as well,
but that's obviously a longer term change.

thinking about this some more.

if "wide links = no" is the chosen solution, then for this use case
the user needs to set "wide links = yes" to get this to work, and then
they are vulnerable to the security issue, which is bad.

on the other hand, if remote "wide link" prevention is the chosen
solution, then this use case is supported and the user is concurrently
protected from the security issue.  however, it adds the additional
tedium of getting authorization from the samba administrator to create
the symlink.

       wide links (S)

           This parameter controls whether or not links in the UNIX file
           system may be followed by the server. Links that point to areas
           within the directory tree exported by the server are always
           allowed; this parameter controls access only to areas that are
           outside the directory tree being exported.

           Note that setting this parameter can have a negative effect
on your
           server performance due to the extra system calls that Samba
has to
           do in order to perform the link checks.

           Default: wide links = yes

This is samba 2:3.4.5~dfsg-1. Note the name is wide links, not wide_links.

i.e. the app would have to always make use of /usr/local/lib, rather
than ./symlink-to-local-usr-local-lib.

the problem is that some users will need to set "wide links = yes", and
will be forced to leave themselves vulnerable to this issue.

Claimed Zero Day exploit in Samba.

A user named "kcopedarookie" posted what they claim to
be a video of a zero-day exploit in Samba on youtube
yesterday here:

<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN50RtZ2N74&aia=true>

The video shows modifications to smbclient allowing
/etc/passwd to be downloaded from a remote server.

The issue is actually a default insecure configuration
in Samba.

Quick FAQ: What do I do !
-------------------------

Set:

wide links = no

in the [global] section of your smb.conf and restart
smbd to eliminate this problem.

Longer FAQ: The real issue
--------------------------

The problem comes from a combination of two features in
Samba, each of which on their own are useful to Administrators,
but in combination allow users to access any file on the system
that their logged in username has permissions to read (this is
not a privilege escalation problem).

By default Samba ships with the parameter "wide links = yes",
which allows Administrators to locally (on the server) add
a symbolic link inside an exported share which SMB/CIFS clients
will follow.

As an example, given a share definition:

[tmp]
	path = /tmp
	read only = no
	guest ok = yes

The administrator could add a symlink:

$ ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd

and SMB/CIFS clients would then see a file called "passwd"
within the [tmp] share that could be read and would allow
clients to read /etc/passwd.

If the "wide links" parameter is set to "no", any attempt
to read this file will fail with an "access denied" error.

The problem occurs as Samba allows clients using the UNIX
extensions (which are also turned on by default) to create
symlinks on remotely mounted shares on which they have write
access that point to any path on the file system.

This is by design, as applications running on UNIX clients
may have good reasons to create symlinks anywhere on the
filesystem they have write access that point to local files
(such as /etc/passwd).

UNIX clients will resolve these links locally, but Windows
clients will resolve them on the server. It is this combination
that causes the problem.

All future versions of Samba will have the parameter
"wide links" set to "no" by default, and the manual
pages will be updated to explain this issue.

while more secure (hardened) defaults are good, wouldn't it be more
effective to tackle the root cause of the problem?  i.e. on the samba
server side, detect attempts by remote users to create symlinks to
targets outside of their authorized shares and prevent that.

Any update on this? I think unexpected insecure default
configurations that surprise admins did get CVE numbers in the past.

hardcoded to what ?

what would be advantage except making the life of a user harder when an
application that needs to create a symlink breaks ?

Remember that creating a symlink is not a problem, with wide links = no
it is not followed in any case.

Simo.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.
(CVE-2010-1321: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C))
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- kvirc
This update of KVirc fixes a remotely exploitable format string and
directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2010-2451, CVE-2010-2452).
Additionally KVirc does not further allow remote client to send
arbitrary CTCP commands. (CVE-2010-2785)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- lftp
This update of lftp improves the filename handling of downloaded files
to avoid downloading arbitrary content to unexpected locations (like
.login). (CVE-2010-2251)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libpython2\_6-1\_0
This update of python has a copy of libxmlrpc that is vulnerable to
denial of service bugs that can occur while processing malformed XML
input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,
and Access Control (CWE-264)
- CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Insufficient Information
- CVE-2009-3560: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Buffer Errors (CWE-119)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libtiff
This update of libtiff fixes several integer overflows that could lead
to a corrupted heap memory. This bug can be exploited remotely with a
crafted TIFF file to cause an application crash or probably to execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1411)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libvorbis
This update of libvorbis fixes a memory corruption while parsing OGG
files. This bug was exploitable by remote attackers to cause an
application crash and could probably be exploited to execute arbitrary
code.
CVE-2009-2663: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8: Resource Management Errors (CWE-399)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- lxsession
lxsession-logout did not properly lock the screen before suspending,
hibernating and switching between users which could allow attackers with
physical access to take control of the system to obtain sensitive infor-
mation and / or execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who is
currently logged in (CVE-2010-2532).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- mono-addon-bytefx-data-mysql/bytefx-data-mysql
Mono's ASP.NET implementation did not set the 'EnableViewStateMac'
property by default. Attackers could exploit that to conduct cross-
site-scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2010-1459)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- moodle
Moodle was prone to several Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
(CVE-2010-2228, CVE-2010-2229, CVE-2010-2230, CVE-2010-2231).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- openldap2
Specially crafted MODRDN operations can crash the OpenLDAP server.
(CVE-2010-0211 and CVE-2010-0212)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- opera
Opera was upgraded to the 10.60 release.
- CVE-2010-0653: Opera permits cross-origin loading of CSS style sheets
even when the style sheet download has an incorrect
MIME type and the style sheet document is malformed,
which allows remote HTTP servers to obtain sensitive
information via a crafted document.
- CVE-2010-1993: Opera 9.52 does not properly handle an IFRAME element
with a mailto: URL in its SRC attribute, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via an HTML document with many IFRAME
elements.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS was prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities which could
allow remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code via
unspecified vectors. (CVE-2010-0438)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- popt
This update fixes the problem where RPM misses to clear the SUID/SGID
bit of old files during package updates. (CVE-2010-2059)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
This update of postgresql was pblished to fix several minor security
vulnerabilities:
- CVE-2010-1975: postgresql does not properly check privileges during
certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.

which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- python-mako
Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly
escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- vte
VTE was vulnerable to an old title set+query attack which could be used
by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2713).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- w3m
w3m did not handle embedded nul characters in the common name and in
subject alternative names of x509 certificates.
CVE-2010-2074 has been assigned to this issue.
This update also turns on verification of x509 certificates by default
which was not the case before.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- xmlrpc-c
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=562568#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-02-07 13:17:45 UTC  ``` Security researcher called "Kingcope" pointed out:    [1] <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Feb/82>   [2] <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN50RtZ2N74>  and detailed:    [3] <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Feb/99>  a deficiency in the behaviour of Samba server, providing SMB/CIFS services to the clients.  Samba server, in the default configuration, is shipped with configuration file parameter "wide links" set to "yes" ("wide links = yes"). If a local user would first locally create a symbolic link, which target would point to some system sensitive file / directory and link name of this link would be placed into an exported Samba share, with write access for Samba users, this might allow a remote attacker to read, list and retrieve files, behind the target of the symbolic link.  Samba upstream review of reasons and impact of this issue:    [4] <http://marc.info/?l=samba-technical&m=126539387432412&w=2>  As mentioned in [4] the problem "is actually a default insecure configuration in Samba." and "comes from a combination of two  features in Samba, each of which on their own are useful to Administrators".   Workaround -- to prevent occurrence of this deficiency set: ===========================================================  wide links = no  in the [global] section of your smb.conf and restart the Samba (smbd) daemon. This will ensure, remote Samba clients will not follow symbolink links, exported in Samba shares, to their target anymore (thus prevent the potential disclosure of sensitive data).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=562568#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-02-07 13:19:27 UTC  ``` Link to public Metasploit module:    <http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/02/exploiting-samba-symlink-traversal.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=562568#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2010-02-08 14:34:52 UTC  ``` Upstream bug report and patch to make sure "wide links" and "unix extensions" can not both be enabled on one share:  <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7104> <http://gitweb.samba.org/?p=samba.git;a=commitdiff;h=bd269443e311d96ef495a9db47d1b95eb83bb8f4>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=562568#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-06 04:09:00 UTC  ``` This has been assigned [CVE-2010-0926](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0926).   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=562568#c10)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-28 17:32:50 UTC  ``` Updated: 2012-02-21  Statement:  This issue was addressed in Samba packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. It did not affect Samba packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact. There is no plan to address this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  To prevent this issue, disable "wide links" or "unix extensions" in the Samba configuration file (/etc/samba/smb.conf) and restart smbd (service smb restart). Disabled "wide links" ensure that remote Samba clients will not have wide symbolic links (links pointing outside of the shared directory) resolved on the server side when processing requests from a client that does not support UNIX extensions. Disabled "unix extensions" prevents creation of wide links by malicious clients which support UNIX extensions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- gnome-screensaver
Pressing the "Return" key repeatedly caused an X error that terminated
gnome-screensaver (CVE-2010-0732).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- tomcat5, tomcat6
tomcat was updated to fix several security issues:
- CVE-2009-2693, CVE-2009-2902:
Directory traversal vulnerability allowed remote attackers
to create or overwrite arbitrary files/dirs with a specially crafted
WAR file.
- CVE-2009-2901:
When autoDeploy is enabled the autodeployment process deployed
appBase files that remain from a failed undeploy, which might allow
remote attackers to bypass intended authentication requirements
via HTTP requests.
- CVE-2008-5515:
When using the RequestDispatcher method, it was possible for remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and conduct directory
traversal attacks.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libtheora
An integer overflow was fixed in libtheora. It could be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-3389).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- java-1\_6\_0-sun
Sun Java 6 Update 19 was released to fix a large number of security
issues, including several buffer overflows.
(CVE-2010-0082, CVE-2010-0084, CVE-2010-0085, CVE-2010-0087,
CVE-2010-0088, CVE-2010-0089, CVE-2010-0090, CVE-2010-0091,
CVE-2010-0092, CVE-2010-0093, CVE-2010-0094, CVE-2010-0095,
CVE-2010-0837, CVE-2010-0838, CVE-2010-0839, CVE-2010-0840,

CVE-2010-0845, CVE-2010-0846, CVE-2010-0847, CVE-2010-0848,
CVE-2010-0849, CVE-2010-0850).
This update also disables unsafe TLS renegotiations (CVE-2009-3555).
Please refer to the following document for more information:
<http://java.sun.com/javase/javaseforbusiness/docs/TLSReadme.html>
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- samba
With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links on the server
side, therefore allowing clients to overwrite arbitrary files
(CVE-2010-0926). This update changes the default setting to have
"wide links" disabled by default. The new default only works if
"wide links" is not set explicitly in smb.conf.
Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker could corrupt
/etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid root. mount.cifs is not
setuid root by default and it's not recommended to change that
(CVE-2010-0547).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Given the count of users that are probably affected by this and it not being
documented in e.g. man 5 smb.conf I'd vote for yes! :)
