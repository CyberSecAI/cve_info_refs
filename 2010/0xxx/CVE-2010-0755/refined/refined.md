Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with WikyBlog 1.7.3rc2, including the one related to CVE-2010-0755

**CVE-2010-0755 is one of multiple CVEs listed for WikyBlog 1.7.3rc2 vulnerabilities**.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **File Upload Vulnerability (Implied)**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insecure file upload mechanism.
    *   **Weakness:** Allows arbitrary file uploads, potentially including malicious scripts (e.g., PHP shells).
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution by uploading and accessing malicious files.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Register an account, use the upload form.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs a valid account to upload.

2.  **Cookie Manipulation Vulnerability**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization/output encoding when setting cookies.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize user input that is reflected in a cookie. An attacker can inject arbitrary META tags in the `which` parameter which allows modifying the cookies stored in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session fixation, allowing the attacker to hijack user sessions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted GET request to `/Wiky/index.php/Special/Main/Templates`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send a crafted GET request.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**
   *   **Root Cause:** Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input reflected in the page.
   *  **Weakness:**  The application fails to sanitize user supplied input via the `which` parameter in the url when reflected in the html page.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacement, and other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted GET request to `/Wiky/index.php/Special/Main/Templates` with Javascript code in the `which` parameter.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send a crafted GET request.

4.  **Session Fixation Vulnerability**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows the session ID to be set through the URL, instead of generating a new, random session ID upon login.
    *   **Weakness:**  The application accepts the `jsessionid` parameter to set session cookies.
    *   **Impact:** Session fixation, allowing the attacker to hijack user sessions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted GET requests to `/Wiky/index.php/Comment/Main/`,  `/Wiky/index.php/Comment/Main/Home_Wiky/`, or `/Wiky/index.php/Edit/Main/`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send a crafted GET request.

5.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application includes a file based on user-controlled input (`langFile` parameter).
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization of the `langFile` parameter in `/Wiky/include/WBmap.php` that allows including remote files.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution by including arbitrary code hosted on a malicious server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted GET request to `/Wiky/include/WBmap.php` with an external URL in the `langFile` parameter.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send a crafted GET request.
