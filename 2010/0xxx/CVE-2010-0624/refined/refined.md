  "CVE-2010-0624": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tar and cpio archive manipulation tools expanded archives with certain character in the archive name. If a local user was tricked into expanding a specially-crafted archive, it could cause the tar, cpio executables to crash or, potentially, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the utility.",
    "root_cause": "A boundary error in the rmt_read__ function in lib/rtapelib.c, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
       "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attacker could entice a user to load a specially crafted archive, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted archive",
      "Networked rmt server"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious archive and either convince a user to extract it locally or control a remote rmt server accessed by the target application.",
     "additional_details": [
        "The vulnerability is present in GNU tar and cpio.",
        "The vulnerability is triggered during archive expansion or extraction.",
         "The issue affects the rmt_read__ function which is related to remote tape access.",
         "Using tar's --force-local option can help avoid exploitation."
