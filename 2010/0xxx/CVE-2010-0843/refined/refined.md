  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An integer parameter used in memory allocation within the com.sun.media.sound libraries is not properly checked, leading to a heap overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation leading to integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun's Java Runtime Environment.",

      "Visiting a web page containing a maliciously crafted untrusted Java applet."

    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to host a malicious web page with a crafted Java applet"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The specific flaw exists within a function responsible for allocating objects in the com.sun.media.sound libraries. This function takes an integer parameter and adds a fixed amount to it before allocating from the heap. This can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution by forcing a call to this allocator with a large enough integer parameter."
