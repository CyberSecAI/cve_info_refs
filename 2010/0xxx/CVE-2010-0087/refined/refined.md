Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0087:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents contain multiple references to CVE-2010-0087, specifically within the context of Java vulnerabilities. This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause is an unspecified vulnerability within the "Java Web Start, Java Plug-in" component of Oracle Java SE and Java for Business. This vulnerability is linked to untrusted Java applets and how they interact with the Java sandbox. The vulnerability details do not describe the specific programming flaw, but rather highlights an issue in how applets are handled in general.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The primary weakness is the ability of a maliciously crafted untrusted Java applet to bypass the Java sandbox restrictions. This allows for potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:
    *   **Remote Execution of Arbitrary Code**: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, with the privileges of the user running the applet.
    *   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**:  Exploitation can lead to loss of confidentiality (data breaches), loss of integrity (data modification), and impact availability (denial of service).
*   **Attack Vectors**: The primary attack vector is through a web browser. An attacker can embed a malicious Java applet into a website. When a user visits this website, the applet executes, potentially leading to exploitation. Another attack vector is Java Web Start applications. 
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Remote Network Access**: Attackers must be able to host or inject their malicious Java applet onto a reachable web server.
    *   **Malicious Applet Creation**:  Attackers need to be able to craft malicious Java applets that exploit the sandbox escape.
    *   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any user authentication, making it especially dangerous.

**3. Additional details from various sources**

*   **Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - March 2010**: This document provides the context of the CVE within a larger set of security fixes, confirming the vulnerability is part of a larger Oracle security issue.
*   **Apple Security Updates**: Documents show the vulnerability affects Java installations on macOS, which are addressed through updates that include fixes. The description also highlights a critical impact, "Visiting a web page containing a maliciously crafted untrusted Java applet may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user."
*   **HP Security Bulletin**: This bulletin confirms the presence of this CVE in "HP-UX Running Java" and highlights that the vulnerability can lead to "Remote execution of arbitrary code, disclosure of information, and other vulnerabilities." This source also clarifies the affected HP-UX versions and recommends specific patch versions for resolution.
*   **SUSE Security Summary Report**: This report lists CVE-2010-0087 as being resolved by their Java update. It highlights that the fix was part of an update addressing "a large number of security issues, including several buffer overflows". This source implies the vulnerability might have an overflow component.
*   **VMware Security Advisory**: This source shows the vulnerability was mitigated by updating to "Oracle (Sun) JRE updated to version 1.6.0_21" and specifies that the update addressed "multiple security issues that existed in earlier releases".

**4. Summary**

CVE-2010-0087 is a vulnerability that enables arbitrary code execution due to the way untrusted applets interact with the Java sandbox. The vulnerability affects Java Web Start and Java Plugin. The attack vector is through malicious web pages.  The vulnerability has been confirmed to affect multiple systems, and updates have been made available by various vendors. The vulnerability is serious due to the potential for remote code execution and requires prompt attention.
