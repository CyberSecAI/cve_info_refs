  "CVE-2010-0838": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Java 1.6.0_17, the most serious of which may allow an untrusted Java applet to execute arbitrary code outside the Java sandbox. Visiting a web page containing a maliciously crafted untrusted Java applet may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user.",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the CMM module of the Sun JVM in the function readMabCurveData. The function trusts the size of a curv object, provided by an applet, implicitly and copies the data into a fixed-length stack buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
        "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a web page containing a maliciously crafted untrusted Java applet"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs to host a malicious web page with a specially crafted Java applet"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by enticing a user to visit a malicious web page with a specifically crafted untrusted Java applet.  This issue is addressed by updating to Java version 1.6.0_20."
