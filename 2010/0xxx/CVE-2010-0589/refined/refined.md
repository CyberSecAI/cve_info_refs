Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-0589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Cisco Secure Desktop Web Install ActiveX control (specifically, the control with CLSID `705EC6D4-B138-4079-A307-EF13E4889A82`).
*   This ActiveX control fails to properly verify the digital signature of the executable it downloads and installs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Signature Verification:** The core weakness is the lack of proper verification of the downloaded executable's signature. This allows an attacker to replace a legitimate executable with a malicious one.
*   **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is located within an ActiveX control, which, when exploited, can lead to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker gains full control over the compromised system with the privileges of the currently logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The primary attack vector involves tricking the user into visiting a malicious web page hosting the exploit.
*   **Exploitation via ActiveX:** The malicious page would contain code that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker can be remote, requiring only the ability to host a malicious web page.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to lure the victim to visit the malicious web page.
*   **Crafted Exploit:** The attacker must be able to craft an exploit that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Additional Details:**

*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a specific Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['8247'].
*   Cisco has released an update to address this vulnerability.
