**CVE-2010-0512**

*   **Root Cause:** An implementation issue in the handling of system login restrictions for network accounts.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** If network accounts allowed to log in to the system at the Login Window are identified by group membership only, the restriction will not be enforced.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A network user may be able to bypass system login restrictions and gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs at the system login window by attempting to log in with a network account.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a network user and the system must be configured to use a network account server with login restrictions based only on group membership.
