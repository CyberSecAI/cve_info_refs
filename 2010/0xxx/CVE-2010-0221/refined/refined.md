Content from www.h-online.com_deaf5ee6_20250125_045442.html and it.slashdot.org_2d8850ed_20250125_045442.html provides more details than the official CVE description.
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the password handling mechanism of several hardware-encrypted USB drives. Instead of generating a unique key based on the user-provided password, the drives use the same static decryption key across all devices. The password entry program sends the same character string to the drive after performing various crypto operations, regardless of the password entered by the user.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Use of a static, shared encryption key across multiple devices.
- Authentication process is flawed and allows bypassing.
- Password verification is done by the host software, not within the secure hardware.
- Inadequate implementation of the FIPS 140-2 standard.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can bypass the password protection and decrypt data from affected USB drives by sending the known static key to the device. This allows full access to the data without knowledge of the user's password.

Attack vectors:
- Intercepting the communication between the password program and the USB drive.
- Using a small tool or "widget" that sends the correct decryption command.
- Directly mounting the second partition on Linux systems and bypassing authentication altogether.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Physical access to the vulnerable USB device.
- Ability to intercept and manipulate the commands sent to the device, which can be done via software or by using a man-in-the-middle attack
- Basic understanding of how to mount partitions and communicate with the device.
