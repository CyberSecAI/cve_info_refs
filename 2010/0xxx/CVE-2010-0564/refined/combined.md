How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

rollback.
5.2 Manual Rollback Procedure
=====================================================================
To manually roll back to the previous configuration:
a. Locate the backup folder that the critical patch package created
in the "\PCCSRV\Backup\CriticalPatch\_B1224" directory.
b. Copy the backup modules to the original folders.
c. Run the "TmTouch.exe" tool to trigger the hot fix mechanism.
To run "TmTouch.exe":
i. Open a command prompt on the server.
ii. Go to the "PCCSRV\admin\utility\touch" directory.
iii. Run the touch tool using the following syntax:
TmTouch.exe

2. What's New
========================================================================
This patch addresses the following issues and includes the
following enhancements:
2.1 Enhancements
=============================================================================
The following enhancements are included in this patch:
Enhancement 1: Patch 5 adds Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) 7
platform support for OfficeScan clients.
Please be sure to update the following drivers
to Windows 7 compatible version:
- Virus Scan Engine (8.952 or higher)
- Virus Cleanup Engine (6.2.1016 or higher)
- Anti-rootkit Driver (2.8.1063 or higher)
- Common Firewall Driver(NSC) (5.8.1092 or higher)
"Virus Scan Engine" and "Virus Cleanup Engine"
can be updated from TrendMicro ActiveUpdate server.
The "Anti-rootkit Driver" and "Common Firewall
Driver(NSC)" are included in this patch.
Notes:
Updating the Common Firewall Driver may cause a short
network disruption on client. The TDI driver which
is updated with Common Firewall Driver requires a
system reboot to load the new driver. Please refer
to Section 5.1 for more information.
This patch provides a function to allow OfficeScan
clients to update the Common Firewall Driver only
after the system reboots. This can avoid network
disruption when updating the Common Firewall Driver.
Please refer to Post-installation section 6.1.9.
Enhancement 2: Patch 5 adds a new function to enable OfficeScan
clients to check the file MD5 checksum when retrieving
file from OfficeScan server. This prevents clients
from getting corrupt files from the server.
Note : This function does not work if the patch is
deployed on clients because clients are still using an
old version of this patch. It will only work when the
latest hot fix and patches are applied.
Enhancement 3: Users who configure standard alerts can use "%i" to
display the infected computer's IP address on the
alert message.
Enhancement 4: When OfficeScan client is installed, it automatically
removes the following products first:
- Authentium(TM) Command AntiVirus for Windows
Enterprise 4.9x
- Computer Associates (CA) eTrust(TM) Antivirus 8.1.655
- eScan(TM) for Windows 8.0.653.1
- ESET(TM) NOD32(TM) Antivirus build 3.0.642
- ESET NOD32 Antivirus 3.0.667.0
- ESET NOD32 Antivirus 3.0.684.0
- F-Secure(TM) Anti-Virus Client Security 6.03

- Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0.4202.75
- Symantec 11.0.4000.2295 Endpoint Protection 64-bit Edition
Enhancement 5: Users can specify another update schedule for offline
OfficeScan clients. When clients are online, they use
the original scheduled update settings. Once clients
go offline, they can switch to the new scheduled update
settings. Offline clients are clients that are not
connected to the server because of reasons such as:
- the clients are disconnected from the office network
- the OfficeScan server is not up and running
Refer to section on Post-installation for detailed
configuration steps to specify another update schedule
for offline OfficeScan clients.
Enhancement 6: Patch 5 introduces the following Scheduled Scan enhancements.
Refer to the online help for details about these enhancements.
The Scheduled Scan enhancements were introduced since
OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 with Patch 1)
Postpone Scheduled Scan
-----------------------
Users with the "Postpone Scheduled Scan" privilege can
perform the following actions:
- Postpone scheduled scan before its scheduled run
and specify the postponement duration.
- If scheduled scan is in progress, stop scanning
and restart it at a later time. Users can specify
the amount of time that should elapse before scanning
restarts.
Skip and Stop Scheduled Scan
----------------------------
- Users can skip scheduled scan before its scheduled
run or stop scheduled scan when it is in progress.
- OfficeScan can automatically stop a scheduled scan
when scanning takes longer than the period of time
that the user has configured.
- OfficeScan can skip scheduled scan if a wireless
computer's power supply runs low and the AC adapter
is unplugged.
Resume Scheduled Scan
---------------------
When the OfficeScan client misses a scheduled scan
because it is not running on the day and time set for
the Scheduled Scan, scanning will be launched at the
scheduled time, regardless of the day, when the client
resumes running.
Scheduled Scan Reminder
-----------------------
You can now configure OfficeScan to display a
notification message informing users of an upcoming
Scheduled Scan and any Scheduled Scan privileges
(postpone, skip, or stop Scheduled Scan) you have
granted them.
2.2 Resolved Known Issues
=====================================================================
Patch 5 resolves the following product issues:
(170999 EN\_Hotfix\_3371)
Issue 1: The OfficeScan Client Packager tool command line mode does
not support the "Update Agent" option.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 1: After applying this patch, the Client Packager tool can
support the "Update Agent" option in command line mode.
Procedure 1: To use the new tool to create client installation packages
through the command line, follow the step below:
a. Add the "/ua" parameter to the command string.
For example:
clnpack.exe /i /o NT /ua /s "C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\
OfficeScan\PCCSRV" /d "C:\Temp\UA\_client.exe"
Where "C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\OfficeScan\PCCSRV"
is the folder where the source file is, while
"C:\Temp\UA\_client.exe" specifies the name and location
of the output file.
(168449 EN\_Hotfix\_3373)
Issue 2: Users cannot sort data by columns in the "Component Update
Details" on the Networked Computers page.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 2: After applying this patch, the sorting function in the
"Component Update Details" on the Networked Computers page
works properly.
(170068 EN\_Hotfix\_3372)
Issue 3: OfficeScan 32-bit clients can write Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM)
NT event logs for some conditions. OfficeScan 64-bit clients
do not have this functionality.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 3: This patch enables OfficeScan 64-bit clients to write Windows
NT event logs.
(171163 EN\_Hotfix\_3374)
Issue 4: Hot fix 3374 resolves the issue wherein the OfficeScan client
console displays the wrong spyware pattern file version.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 4: This patch handles the third digit after the decimal point of
the spyware pattern version to solve the issue.
(171716 EN\_Hotfix\_3376)
Issue 5: In the "Scheduled Verification" page, if users set the value
of the "start time:" between 12:00 PM and 12:59 PM, the value
of the "Scheduled\_Reestablish\_AmPm" parameter in the "ofcscan.ini"
file becomes "1". Setting "Scheduled\_Reestablish\_AmPm=1"
signifies the time as AM not PM.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 5: This patch enhances the boundary condition checking to fix
this issue.
(169286 EN\_hotfix\_3378)
Issue 6: When users delete more than one unnecessary update source
from "Updates" > "Networked Computers" > "Update Source" on
the OfficeScan console, some of these update sources are not
deleted from the configuration files. These unnecessary update
sources do not serve any purpose and may confuse users.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 6: This patch adds a function for removing all unnecessary
update sources from the configuration file.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.1.1 for
detailed configuration steps.
(170339 EN\_Hotfix\_3380)
Issue 7: The Image Setup Utility tool, an OfficeScan client tool,
cannot be run on Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) Vista and Windows
server 2008.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 7: This patch adds the support of Windows Vista and Windows
server 2008 platforms for this tool.
(168807 EN\_Hotfix\_3383)
Issue 8: When "ntrtscan.exe" scans a large file, "ntrtscan.exe" unloads
the scan engine drivers which causes the blue screen of death
(BSoD).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 8: After applying this patch, "ntrtscan.exe" can successfully
scan large files.
Note: To support this function, users need to update the
virus scan engine to version 8.960.1009 or a later
version.
164901 EN\_Hotfix\_3384)
Issue 9: OfficeScan clients upload suspected infected files to the
"PCCSRV\Temp" folder of the OfficeScan server where the
files are temporary stored before being transferred to the
"PCCSRV\Virus" folder. Suspected infected files that are
not uploaded completely will remain in the "PCCSRV\Temp"
folder and will occupy disk space.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 9: After applying this patch, if the upload process terminates
abnormally, OfficeScan will not save the suspected infected
files in the "PCCSRV\Temp" folder.
(171669 EN\_Hotfix\_3386) (169316 EN\_Hotfix\_3379)
Issue 10: OfficeScan Common Firewall Driver may cause the blue
screen of death issue on Windows(TM) system.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 10: This patch updates the OfficeScan 8.0 Common Firewall Driver
to solve this issue.
(171448 EN\_Hotfix\_3388)
Issue 11: In Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) Vista platform, launching the
OfficeScan client console takes several seconds and uses a
high amount of CPU resources.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 11: After applying this patch, the OfficeScan client console
launches in a shorter amount of time and does not require
a high amount of CPU resources to launch.
(172645 EN\_Hotfix\_3389)
Issue 12: The status for OfficeScan clients that have been inactive/
offline for a long period of time, are not purged
from the database. This issue occurs when OfficeScans
purge client procedure stops because it cannot find
the clients?data in the database.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 12: This patch enhances OfficeScan's purge client procedure to
ensure that the database contains the offline/online
status of active clients only.
(173091 EN\_Hotfix\_3390)
Issue 13: After applying hot fix 3376, some items in the "Move client"
page are disabled.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 13: After applying this patch, the file dependency issue of
hot fix 3376 is solved.
(168307 EN\_Hotfix\_3393)
Issue 14: When users move OfficeScan clients from an old OfficeScan
server to a new OfficeScan server, OfficeScan clients may
register back to the old server after a while. This issue
occurs when the clients are moved using the client mover
tool or through the management console.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 14: After applying this patch, when users move OfficeScan clients
from one server to another, the old server will remove the
client data from its "notify queue". This prevents the old
server from notifying the client at a later time and prevents
clients from registering back to the old server.
(170555 EN\_hotfix\_3393.1)
Issue 15: In a Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) Vista platform, the Windows
Security Center shows the status of the OfficeScan client as
"Not compatible". This issue occurs because Microsoft changed
its status reporting format.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 15: After applying this patch, OfficeScan clients will use
Microsoft's new reporting format when sending status to the
Windows Security Center.
(169641 EN\_Hotfix\_3393.2)
Issue 16: When an OfficeScan client computer starts in a network
environment and the client applies the firewall settings
before it can obtain a valid IP address, the client will use
the IP "0.0.0.0". When this happens, the client cannot apply
the correct firewall settings from the server and will use
the default firewall settings instead.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 16: This patch provides an option to extend the time for an
OfficeScan client to obtain an IP address during startup.
This ensures that the OfficeScan client will be able to obtain
valid IP address before applying the firewall settings. This resolves
the issue.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.1.2 for
detailed configuration steps.
(172648 EN\_Hotfix\_3396)
Issue 17: The OfficeScan notification email messages do not use the
specified daylight saving time (DST) setting.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 17: This patch updates the TmNotify.dll module to fix the
notification related issue.
(170179 EN\_Hotfix\_3394)
Issue 18: When an OfficeScan client starts, it tries to connect to
the server to establish its own online/offline status.
When the client cannot establish a connection with the server,
some ISPs redirect the client to another Web page. As a
result, the still offline client perceives its own status
as "online" because the redirect action returns a successful
http return code.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 18: After applying this patch, OfficeScan clients will use a
different http return code for its online/offline status result.
This prevents the client from treating the http return code
for the redirect action as an online status confirmation.
(172973 EN\_Hotfix\_3397)
Issue 19: Users need a registry key for OfficeScan clients to indicate
the clients' update status.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 19: This patch adds the "UpdateOngoing" registry key to OfficeScan
clients under the following path:
HKLM\Software\TrendMicro\PC-cilinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\Misc
OfficeScan clients will set the value of this key to "1" before a
component update. After the component update, OfficeScan clients
will set the value of this key to "0". This key will serve as an
update status indicator for OfficeScan clients.
(173347 EN\_Hotfix\_3401)
Issue 20: When the "Add Manual Scan to the Windows shortcut menu on client
computers" function is enabled, users can scan files and folders
by accessing the right-click menu. This is done by right-clicking a
file or folder on the Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) desktop or in Windows
Explorer(TM) and selecting "Scan with OfficeScan Client" from the
options.
If users select a large number of files or folders to scan,
"PccNT.exe" stops responding unexpectedly.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 20: This patch enhances the OfficeScan clients' memory allocation
mechanism to enable "PccNT.exe" to handle a large number of files.
(173866 EN\_Hotfix\_3406)
Issue 21: When performing manual scans on network drives, OfficeScan
impersonates the user that is currently logged on. This patch
resolves the issue wherein during manual scans on network drives,
OfficeScan reverts to the currently logged on user account after
scanning the first folder. This prevents the "NTRtScan" service from
retrieving the attributes of and scanning other folders.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 21: After applying this patch, the OfficeScan "NTRtScan" service can
successfully retrieve the attributes of and scan all folders.
(172541 EN\_Hotfix\_3409)
Issue 22: On a Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) platform, the OfficeScan client's
program exception handling function cannot handle an invalid memory
access issue. When this occurs, the OfficeScan client stops
responding and needs to be closed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 22: This patch enables the OfficeScan client's program exception
handling function to correctly handle program exceptions in
Microsoft Windows platforms.
(173851 EN\_Hotfix\_3410)
Issue 23: OfficeScan server's NT event log function on the Notifications
page uses the same event ID for all types of event.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 23: After applying this patch, the OfficeScan server's NT event log
function on the Notifications page assigns the following event IDs
to the respective NT event logs:
- Virus/spyware is detected -- 500
- The action on the virus/spyware is unsuccessful -- 600
- Outbreak is found -- 700
(173569 EN\_Hotfix\_3411)
Issue 24: OfficeScan virus/malware and spyware/grayware logs originally
contain an OfficeScan client's computer name only.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 24: After applying this patch, the logs will also display an
OfficeScan client's IP and MAC addresses.
Note: A client's IP may change in some environments.
For example, when a client detects a virus, its IP
is 10.1.1.1, but when querying the virus log from the server,
its IP is 10.2.2.2. The IP and MAC addresses that are
added to the logs are the current addresses of the client
machine that are used for querying the logs and NOT the client's
addresses when it detects virus, malware, spyware, or grayware.
In the case presented above, the logs will use 10.2.2.2 as
the client's IP address.
(172600 EN\_Hotfix\_3415)
Issue 25: When the OfficeScan virus cleanup engine (DCE) detects and
cleans malware, the virus log displays the malware as
"cleaned by DCE" instead of displaying the file name or the
path where the malware was detected.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 25: This patch enables the virus log to show the file name or
the path where the malware was detected.
(175721 EN\_Hotfix\_3425)
Issue 26: When OfficeScan clients start or perform a manual or
scheduled scan, the clients will run the "Process Image File
Scan" function first to list all running processes on the
system and scan all related files. This delays the start-up
and scan processes and affects system performance.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 26: This patch provides the following enhancements:
- enhances the performance of the "Process Image File Scan"
function in OfficeScan clients.
- adds a Global Setting to disable the "Process Image File Scan"
function on all OfficeScan clients.
- adds an option to disable the "Process Image File Scan" function
on certain OfficeScan clients.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.1.3 and
6.1.4 for detailed configuration steps.
(172986 EN\_Hotfix\_3428.1)
Issue 27: "TmListen.exe" monitors the routing table and IP address events
in a single thread. These threads call the "NotifyRouteChange"
function at the same rate as the changes in the routing table.
When the frequency of the changes to the routing table is high,
a non-paged pool overflow issue occurs because the
"NotifyRouteChange" function uses non-page pool memory. MSDN
cannot disable the handle on the threads after calling this
API, which causes the issue to increase in severity.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 27: This patch enables OfficeScan to monitor the IP address only and
not the routing table event to resolve the issue.
(175556 EN\_Hotfix\_3430)
Issue 28: OfficeScan clients cannot resend quarantined files to the
OfficeScan server if the first quarantine attempt is
unsuccessful.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 28: This patch updates "PccNTMon.exe" to use new VSAPI DLL to
resolve this issue.
(175380 EN\_Hotfix\_3429)
Issue 29: The "DontDropUnknowTCP" setting for the OfficeScan client
firewall is dropped after a common firewall driver update.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 29: After applying this patch, OfficeScan clients can keep the
"DontDropUnknowTCP" setting after a common firewall driver
update.
(173004 EN\_Hotfix\_3432)
Issue 30: OfficeScan server needs a function to detect and verify
digital signatures of files in its directories.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 30: After applying this patch, if an OfficeScan server detects
that a file in its directory has an invalid digital signature,
it renames the file and adds a warning message in Microsoft(TM)
Windows(TM) application event log.
(164043 EN\_Hotfix\_3434)
Issue 31: OfficeScan Network Security Component (NSC) has an
incompatibility issue with Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) Vista,
Windows Server 2008, or Windows 7 platforms.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 31: This patch updates the OfficeScan NSC to enhance
compatibility with Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008,
and Windows 7 platforms.
(172232 EN\_Hotfix\_3435)
Issue 32: The OfficeScan Trend Micro Vulnerability Scanner can retrieve
the location of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
driver only if it is run under "Pccsrv\Admin\Utility\TMVS"
default path. It cannot retrieve the location of the DHCP
driver if users run it under a different path.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 32: This patch changes the Vulnerability Scanner's logic for
retrieving the location of the DHCP driver. After applying
this patch, the Vulnerability Scanner will retrieve the
information from the related registry key in the OfficeScan
client. This resolves the issue.
(174873 EN\_Hotfix\_3436)
Issue 33: If the OfficeScan client detects a virus but could not clean
or delete it, several virus alert message windows appear
consecutively over a long period of time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 33: This patch enables users to set a minimum time interval in
between duplicate virus alert messages. If a duplicate virus
alert message is triggered within the time interval, the
duplicate message is not displayed.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.1.5 for
detailed configuration steps.
(176614 EN\_Hotfix\_3437)
Issue 34: When users export "Scan Exclusion Lists" information, the
items under the "Scan Now Exclusion List (File Extensions)"
column are the same as those under the "Scan Now Exclusion List
(Files)" column.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 34: This patch enables OfficeScan to export the correct
information for the "Scan Now Exclusion List (File Extensions)"
column.
(175281 EN\_Hotfix\_3448.1)
Issue 35: Network VirusWall Enforcer 1200 and 2500(TM) cannot
recognize the OfficeScan client's system after the
OfficeScan NT firewall is enabled. This issue occurs when
the OfficeScan firewall drops the special ICMP packet sent
by Network VirusWall Enforcer because it does not recognize
it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 35: This patch updates the OfficeScan 8.0 Common Firewall
Driver to resolve the unknown ICMP issue in the IDS feature.
(175478 EN\_Hotfix\_3450)
Issue 36: After applying OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 4, some
Plug-in Manager programs cannot retrieve the correct
OfficeScan domain and client information from the OfficeScan
server database. This issue occurs because OfficeScan 8.0
Service Pack 1 Patch 4 updated the function used to query
OfficeScan domain and client information, which prevents the
plug-in programs from recognizing query results.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 36: This patch splits the function for querying OfficeScan
domain and client information. OfficeScan uses the updated
function while plug-in programs can still use the old
function to query domain and client information.
(164871 EN\_hotfix\_3452)
Issue 37: Some users encounter an issue wherein the OfficeScan server
HTTPDB stops unexpectedly. The root cause of the issue is
hard to trace since it cannot be easily reproduced in time
and users cannot enable server debug log all the time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 37: This patch adds a function for collecting database-related
debug information.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.1.6 for
detailed configuration steps.

Issue 38: The Trend Micro Rootkit Common Module (RCM) of the
OfficeScan client may cause the blue screen of death (BSoD)
issue.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 38: This patch updates the RCM driver to version 2.8.1063.
This new version of the RCM driver includes more checking
procedures to prevent the BSoD issue from recurring.
(178108 EN\_Hotfix\_3454)
Issue 39: The Web Reputation policy approval list cannot handle
approval URLs that end with a slash "/", for example,
"http://abc.com/". This defect is created in the original
javascript while saving the approval URL setting.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 39: This patch enables the checking logic in javascript to
remove the last character from approval URL entries
that end with a slash "/".
(175096 EN\_Hotfix\_3464)
Issue 40: In a roaming user profile environment, users can configure
the system to remove cached local profiles before shutting
down. Sometimes, the system does not remove cached local
profiles properly because the OfficeScan client locks the
"index.dat" file.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 40: This patch updates OfficeScan client spyware scan engine
to version 6.2.0.3015. This version does not lock the
"index.dat" file to allow the system to successfully remove
cached local profiles before shutting down.
(178216 EN\_Hotfix\_3462)
Issue 41: If the "TotalInfected" registry key is missing under
"HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\
CurrentVersion\Misc", the Real-time scan service resets the
counter for the total number of scanned files on the
Real-time monitor dialog box the next time the Real-time
scan service starts up.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 41: After applying this patch, the "TotalInfected" key does
not affect the counter for the total number of scanned
files in the Real-time monitor dialog box.
(178045 EN\_Hotfix\_3465)
Issue 42: After enabling or disabling daylight saving time (DST),
OfficeScan incorrectly calculates the time for the next
scheduled scan. This occurs because OfficeScan does not
detect the change in the DST setting.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 42: After applying this patch, OfficeScan correctly
calculates the time for the next scheduled scan even after
a change in the DST setting.
(176576 EN\_Hotfix\_3471)
Issue 43: The action results on the OfficeScan client console virus
logs are inconsistent with those in the OfficeScan server
console.
For example, when "NtRtscan.exe" detects a virus and the
action is "Quarantine", "NtRtscan.exe" prompts
"PccNTMon.exe" to upload the infected file to the
OfficeScan server without determining if the infected file
was successfully moved to the client's "SUSPECT" folder or
not. Sometimes, the scan engine cannot move the infected
file to the client's "SUSPECT" folder or the folder already
contains a file that has the same file name as the infected
file. This causes the action result in the client virus log
to report a failed action while the server virus log
reports a successful action.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 43: After applying this patch, "NtRtscan.exe" waits for the
the action result from the VSAPI scan engine.
If the action is "Quarantine" and the action result is
"Successful", "NtRtscan.exe" creates a virus log in the
OfficeScan client's "Flog folder". This prompts
"PccNTMon.exe" to upload the infected file.
In cases where the infected file is inside a compressed
file, "NtRtscan.exe" cannot check the action result for the
infected file but checks the action result of the
compressed file instead.
(176387 EN\_Hotfix\_3470)
Issue 44: OfficeScanNT RealTime scan service cannot start properly
due to system resources issues that may occur while the scan
engine starts.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 44: After applying this patch, when the RealTime scan service
starts and it receives a "system too busy" notification, it
tries to restart the scan engine.
(173660 EN\_hotfix\_3473)
Issue 45: When OfficeScan clients update the virus pattern file, the
scan engine file is also unloaded and reloaded.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 45: After applying this patch, OfficeScan clients update
pattern files directly without unloading and reloading the
scan engine file.
(178610 EN\_Hotfix\_3475)
Issue 46: Sometimes, OfficeScan cannot migrate firewall settings
successfully because an active file in no sharing mode was
opened and not closed properly. This prevents OfficeScan
from saving the firewall profile settings and causes the
firewall tab to disappear from the OfficeScan client
console.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 46: This patch enables OfficeScan to properly close file
handles to prevent file sharing violations. To further
ensure that the firewall settings are successfully
migrated, this patch adds Windows(TM) Vista as target
platform of the "tmcfw" driver un-installation for the
firewall migration task.
(175017 EN\_Hotfix\_3476)
Issue 47: The blue screen of death (BSoD) may occur when the
OfficeScan client Common Firewall Driver of the
Network Security Component (NSC) is running on several
Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) platforms.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 47: This patch updates the NSC driver to resolve the issue.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.1.7 for
detailed configuration steps.
(179001 EN\_Hotfix\_3477)
Issue 48: When the OfficeScan server contains a large number of
"Cfw\*.tmp" files, the OfficeScan server experiences high
CPU usage issues while processing firewall logs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 48: This patch changes the way the OfficeScan server creates
temporary files to prevent high CPU usage issues while
processing firewall logs.
(180009 EN\_Hotfix\_3478)
Issue 49: There is a potential vulnerability which may cause a buffer
overflow issue in the Trend Micro URL Filtering Engine (TMUFE)
which can eventually cause a general protection fault or
cause OfficeScan to stop responding.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 49: This patch updates TMUFE to resolve this issue.
(179399 EN\_Hotfix\_3480)
Issue 50: When an OfficeScan client registers to the database, it is
assigned the unload/uninstall password of the OfficeScan
root. Sometimes, newly installed OfficeScan clients are
registered under a domain with a different unload/uninstall
password. In such cases, the newly installed clients are
still assigned the root's unload/uninstall password instead
of the domain's unload/uninstall password.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 50: After applying this patch, if the newly installed
client is registered to a domain, then it keeps the
unload/uninstall password of the domain and not the
unload/uninstall password of the OfficeScan root.
(172114 EN\_Hotfix\_3485)
Issue 51: Under certain conditions, when the OfficeScan server
detects a virus and it sends a report to Trend Micro
Control Manager(TM) 5.0, it leaves the virus name field
empty. This causes Control Manager 5.0 reports to show
"empty" as the virus name.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 51: This patch adds an option to prevent the OfficeScan
server from sending a notification that does not contain
a virus name to Control Manager 5.0.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Procedure 51: To enable this feature, add the "SkipEmptyVirusNameLog"
DWORD key under the following path and set its value
to "1".
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\OfficeScan\
service\Information\
(177899 EN\_Hotfix\_3481)
Issue 52: Using the "DeviceLock" software to prevent unauthorized
access to USB devices prevents OfficeScan manual scans
from detecting viruses in the USB storage. Only OfficeScan
scheduled scans can detect viruses in the same device.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 52: This patch enables OfficeScan to use another API to check
file attributes in USB devices. This resolves the issue.
(180568 EN\_Hotfix\_3488)
Issue 53: Clicking "OK" on the "Scheduled Scan" page of the client
console enables the spyware/grayware scan function of
Scheduled Scan and sends the setting to the server.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 53: This patch configures the spyware/grayware scan function
properly to resolve the issue. After applying this patch,
clicking "OK" on the "Scheduled Scan" page of the client
console does not enable the spyware/grayware scan function
and only the correct settings are sent to the server.
(179377 EN\_Hotfix\_3492)
Issue 54: The OfficeScan server management console shows a successful
result even when users try to add unsupported
spyware/grayware to the approved list.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 54: This patch enables OfficeScan to display the following
message when users try to add unsupported spyware/grayware
to the approved list in the "Spyware/Grayware Logs" page.
"The approved list does not support one or some of the
selected spyware/grayware."
(180279 EN\_Hotfix\_3491)
Issue 55: OfficeScan clients that were installed using a 64-bit
OfficeScan client setup package created by Client Packager
may receive 32-bit files.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 55: This patch ensures that 64-bit OfficeScan clients
receive the correct files during setup.
(177839 EN\_Hotfix\_3493)
Issue 56: The Trend Micro Common Firewall Pattern is displayed as
"Tmf0.ptn" when the firewall service startup process does
not complete on time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 56: This patch adds the "firewall service startup retry"
option to the OfficeScan client program. After applying
this patch, users can set the firewall service to
retry the startup process on a specified number of times
after the startup process fails.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.1.8 for
detailed configuration steps.
(178129 EN\_Hotfix\_3495)
Issue 57: On the Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) Vista platform, sometimes,
OfficeScan clients cannot add the Trend Micro OfficeScan
Listener service to the Windows firewall exception
settings.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 57: After applying this patch, OfficeScan clients can
successfully add Trend Micro OfficeScan Listener service to
the Windows firewall exception settings on the Windows
Vista platform.
(174309 JP\_Hotfix\_3414)
Issue 58: When updating the common firewall driver, the network
is disconnected unexpectedly.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 58: This patch adds a new function to allow OfficeScan clients
to update the common firewall driver only after the system
restarts.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.1.9 for
detailed configuration steps.
(178437 EN\_Hotfix\_3456)
Issue 59: After applying Patch 4, users cannot upgrade OfficeScan 7.x
clients to 8.0 by MSI client package.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 59: This patch removes Trend Micro Internet Security from
automatic un-installation support because Trend Micro
Internet Security and OfficeScan 7.x clients share some
registry keys. This resolves the issue.
(180405 EN\_Hotfix\_3503)
Issue 60: The Virus Cleanup Engine version information of the
OfficeScan client reverted to an older version after the
client received the Manual Update notification from the
OfficeScan server.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 60: This patch updates the client program to resolve this
issue.
(182963 EN\_Hotfix\_3506)
Issue 61: The word "please" is misspelled as "plese" on the server
console: "Networked Computers" > "Web Reputation" >
"Policies" > "Web Reputation Policies" page.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 61: This patch corrects the word "plese" to "please".
(181877 EN\_Hotfix\_3512)
Issue 62: On Microsoft(TM) Windows(TM) server platforms, after users
upgrade to OfficeScan client 10.0 Service Pack 1, the
Windows server shows a warning message that Trend
Micro Behavior Monitoring drivers did not start properly.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution 62: This patch updates OfficeScan client programs to prevent
this message from appearing after upgrading to OfficeScan
client 10.0 Service Pack 1.
2.3 Resolved Known Issues in Patch 4
=====================================================================
Patch 4 resolves the following product issues:
(163268 EN\_CriticalPatch\_3313)
1. "Ntrtscan.exe" closes unexpectedly and an error message appears
when OfficeScan attempts to scan folders with names that exceed
1040 characters.
After applying Patch 4, OfficeScan allocates memory to processes
using the dynamic memory buffer instead of a static fixed buffer
to resolve the issue.
(158889 EN\_Hotfix\_3247)
2. After applying Patch 4, the NT event log will not record an
unexpected OfficeScanNT RealTime Scan service termination if the
service stops properly after OfficeScan clients receive hot fix
updates.
(158944 EN\_Hotfix\_3252)
3. The OfficeScan server console does not show accurate hot fix
"datetime" values in the "Client Management" page. This issue
occurs when users enable the following option:
"Clients can update components but not upgrade the client program
or deploy hot fixes"
(158282 EN\_Hotfix\_3255)
4. The OfficeScan server loses Web protection logs during a
scheduled log purge or manual log purge in OfficeScan 8.0
Service Pack 1 Patch 1.
(158429 EN\_Hotfix\_3257)
5. The OfficeScan log maintenance function does not follow the
"delete logs older than N days" setting, where N is the age of
the log in days.
(159831 EN\_Hotfix\_3261)
6. Patch 4 enables Control Manager(TM) and OfficeScan to support the
modified Management Communication Protocol (MCP). After applying
Patch 4, when unregistering an OfficeScan client, an OfficeScan
server will send its agent GUID. This enables Control Manager
to execute the unregister command correctly.
(158867 EN\_Hotfix\_3262)
7. The OfficeScan scan engine normally deletes the "VSS\*.\*" temporary
files immediately after scanning. However, in some cases,
OfficeScan does not delete the temporary files.
(159646 EN\_Hotfix\_3264)
8. Newly installed OfficeScan clients cannot enable the NT event log
writing function after starting up for the first time.
The function can only be enabled successfully after restarting
the OfficeScan client program.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.1 for
detailed configuration steps.
(157699 EN\_Hotfix\_3265)
9. When the update queue is empty and the update agent is restarting,
OfficeScan still waits for the update agent to respond before
notifying the normal client. As a result, OfficeScan does
not notify the normal client.
When users disable the program update flag, OfficeScan does not
notify the client to perform the program/hot fix update. This
allows the update agent to set the priority level for other update
requests.
(157835 EN\_Hotfix\_3273)
10. Some software cannot run properly because these cannot find the
corresponding process names in the memory. This issue occurs
because OfficeScan changes the process names that are saved in
the memory to lower-case when the OfficeScan NT Proxy Service is
enabled. For example, for "ABC200" software, OfficeScan changes
its process name to "abc200".
(159703 EN\_Hotfix\_3275)
11. After a scheduled scan, the task tray icon does not change from
the scanning icon to the normal icon. This issue occurs when the
OfficeScan client performs the scheduled scan while connected via
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
(158508 EN\_Hotfix\_3277)
12. A timeout sometimes occurs when the OfficeScan server tries to
connect to the ActiveUpdate (AU) server through a proxy server.
This issue occurs because the hard-coded default timeout value
in the OfficeScan server is too short.
Patch 4 enables users to specify the timeout value for these
type of situations.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.2 for
specific steps to specify the timeout value.
(156968 EN\_Hotfix\_3277.2)
13. The OfficeScan client Real-time scan service does not correctly
detect changes in the scheduled scan setting.
(159892 EN\_Hotfix\_3278)
14. In OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 1, users cannot configure
the timeout value for the HTTP module and globally deploy the
timeout settings to clients. Patch 1 only enables users to
configure the timeout value of the HTTP module WAN environments
where the connection is slow.
Patch 4 enables users to configure the timeout value for the
HTTP module and deploy the settings to clients.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.3 for
detailed configuration steps.
(159645 EN\_Hotfix\_3280)
15. The OfficeScan server records the current quarantine folder size
information in the ".store" hidden file. Every time the OfficeScan
client uploads a quarantined virus to the OfficeScan server,
OfficeScan checks the quarantine folder size in the ".store"
hidden file instead of recalculating the actual size of the
quarantine folder.
After applying Patch 4, users can specify how frequent OfficeScan
should recalculate the actual size of the quarantine folder in the
"ofcscan.ini" file.
This enhances the OfficeScan performance when there is a large
number of files in the quarantine folder and users manage and
delete quarantined files manually.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.4 for
detailed configuration steps to specify the frequency of the
quarantine folder size recalculation.
(158399 EN\_Hotfix\_3285)
16. After applying Patch 4, OfficeScan can globally deploy the Common
Firewall settings from the OfficeScan server to OfficeScan clients
after a change in network.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.5 for
detailed configuration steps to enable this feature.
(161568 EN\_Hotfix\_3294)
17. OfficeScan clients do not display pop-up notifications before
proceeding with scheduled scans in the following situations:
- Client was installed using a client package
- Client cannot communicate with OfficeScan, for example, a laptop
that is not in constant connection with OfficeScan
(161747 EN\_Hotfix\_3298)
18. Patch 4 enhances OfficeScan's scan error handling process by
utilizing the heap mechanism instead of the stack buffer in
the scan directory function. This enhancement prevents the
"NTRtScan.exe" process from stopping unexpectedly when OfficeScan
scans long pathnames either by scheduled or manual scan.
(161112 EN\_Hotfix\_3299)
19. Patch 4 updates the OfficeScan 8.0 MCP agent components to
prevent the MCP agent from sending data when the Control Manager
server is unreachable.
(161569 EN\_Hotfix\_3301)
20. Patch 4 enables users to configure the time interval for sending
virus logs.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.6 for
specific steps to configure the time interval for sending
virus logs.
(162480 EN\_Hotfix\_3304)
21. When the following registry key is set to "1", access to the
CD-ROM drive is restricted to the user account that is currently
logged-in.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\
Winlogon\allocatecdroms
When OfficeScan manually scans the CD-ROM drive, the "NTRtScan"
service cannot access the disk because the "NTRtScan" service
uses a system account to scan.
(161995 EN\_Hotfix\_3306)
22. Patch 4 enables users to deploy the TMProxy process whitelist
from the OfficeScan server.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.7 for
detailed configuration steps to enable the feature.
(161685 EN\_Hotfix\_3307)
23. Patch 4 adds an option to prevent the OfficeScan server from
sending OfficeScan client information to Control Manager.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.8 for
specific steps to enable the option.
(162929 EN\_Hotfix\_3308)
24. When the OfficeScan 8.0 server is installed on a Windows 2003
Server with Internet Information Services (IIS) 6, the OfficeScan
server may be unable to perform pattern updates. This may lead to
"server.ini" file truncation.
(160789 EN\_Hotfix\_3308.1)
(166668 EN\_Hotfix\_3345.1)
25. Patch 4 updates the Network Security Component (NSC) to prevent
the following issues:
- A performance issue that occurs on a computer with multiple
network connections, such as a Windows Active Directory Domain
Controller computer.
- The OfficeScan Common Firewall Driver may cause the blue screen
of death when the length of the content does not match the
payload size.
(163174 EN\_Hotfix\_3309)
26. After applying Patch 4, "PccNT.exe" will successfully load the
"ssaptn" file regardless of whether the Web threat protection
product license is enabled or disabled when performing a scan in
Windows safe mode.
Note: If the "ssaptn" file is not in the OfficeScan client folder,
"PccNT.exe" will perform scans in Windows safe mode without
loading the "ssaptn" file.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.9 for
specific steps to run a virus scan in Windows safe mode.
(162383 EN\_Hotfix\_3309.1)
27. Patch 4 adds an option to prevent OfficeScan from importing
the "quarantine directory path" settings from the exported
OfficeScan "policy.dat" file.
When the option is enabled, the "quarantine directory path"
settings for Manual Scan, Real-time Scan, Scheduled Scan, and
Scan Now will not be imported to the OfficeScan server.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.10 for
specific steps to configure this option.
(163474 EN\_Hotfix\_3312)
28. After applying Patch 4, the OfficeScan NT listener service,
"Tmlisten.exe" skips the discovery process when the new key,
"ExcludeExchangeStore", is disabled. As a result, the stopped
IIS Administrator Service will not start when the "Tmlisten.exe"
service starts.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.11 for
specific steps to configure "Tmlisten.exe" to discover IIS server
and Microsoft Exchange server related folders for exclusion from
scans.
(163236 EN\_Hotfix\_3314)
29. Patch 4 updates the OfficeScan Anti-Spyware Scan Engine
components (SSAPI) to resolve this issue. The new SSAPI will
ignore the shortcut links to unavailable disks, such as "A:",
when scanning for spyware/grayware.
(163189 EN\_Hotfix\_3314.1)
30. After applying Patch 4, all OfficeScan clients will register
to the Windows Security Center using the following GUID only:
4CA5B9AB-4295-4D4C-9664-0EBE85AE0525
Users can use this GUID to identify if the target antivirus
product is OfficeScan 8.0.
(163235 EN\_Hotfix\_3315)
31. Patch 4 prevents the buffer overflow issue that causes
"PccNT.exe" to close unexpectedly during a manual scan.
(167848 EN\_Hotfix\_3358)
32. When OfficeScan clients startup or perform a Manual/Scheduled
scan, they run the "Process Image File Scan" function. Patch 4
allows users to disable the "Process Image File Scan" function
to reduce the startup time and scan time.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.12 for
specific steps to disable the function.
(158177 EN\_Hotfix\_3317)
33. After applying Patch 4, OfficeScan clients will use the proxy
server for client and server communication if the intranet
proxy setting is enabled.
(164306 EN\_Hotfix\_3318)
34. Patch 4:
- Removes the following six (6) file name extensions from the
OfficeScan Web Reputation exclusion list to increase the
detection rate:
- qt
- qtm
- swf
- jar
- js
- css
- Provides a way for users to edit the OfficeScan Web Reputation
excluded file name extension list.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.13 for
detailed steps to manually configure the Web Reputation exclude
extension list.
(163468 EN\_Hotfix\_3319)
35. Patch 4 improves the interaction between "OfcService" and
"DbServer". As a result, the OfficeScan server will not encounter
a deadlock issue even when the OfficeScan command-handling
threads of "OfcService" are busy with requests from other CGIs
while those CGIs are waiting for information from "DbServer".
(164168 EN\_Hotfix\_3320)
36. Users may encounter an application error in the OfficeScan NT
Listener service.
(164425 EN\_Hotfix\_3321)
37. Patch 4 increases the maximum length for filename extensions
in the scan exclusion list from 6 characters to 10 characters.
(164240 EN\_Hotfix\_3322)
38. After applying Patch 4, OfficeScan will wait until third-party
software has been successfully uninstalled before proceeding
with the remote installation. This improves the success rate of
the OfficeScan remote installation process.
(161902 EN\_Hotfix\_3325)
39. Patch 4 enables users to configure OfficeScan to either retrieve
the user name used to start "PccNtMon" from the registry or
retrieve the user name from Security Identifiers (SID). When
OfficeScan is configured to retrieve the user name from Security
Identifiers (SID), it will retrieve the SYSTEM account name.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.14 for
detailed configuration steps to configure this function.
Note: The new function does not work on the Windows 2000
platforms series because of system limitations.
(162938 EN\_Hotfix\_3329)
40. Patch 4 adds the "Domain" column to the table that contains the
result of running the Vulnerability Scanner (TMVS utility) in
silent (batch command) mode. The "Domain" column displays the
domain name of all computers included in the scan.
(166238 EN\_Hotfix\_3329.1)
41. After applying Patch 4, the OfficeScan server will not notify
updated OfficeScan clients to update when users select clients
with outdated components for Manual Update.
(162155 EN\_Hotfix\_3330)
42. OfficeScan clients does not retry sending quarantined files to
the OfficeScan server if the first quarantine attempt is
unsuccessful.
(164418 EN\_Hotfix\_3333)
43. Patch 4 adds an option to enable the OfficeScan server to send the
global OPP to old and newly registered OfficeScan clients.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.15 for
specific steps to configure this option.
(165684 EN\_Hotfix\_3336)
44. The on-off status of the OfficeScan client's Web Reputation
Service may be incorrect. This issue occurs after the OfficeScan
client computer starts up.
(166689 EN\_Hotfix\_3338)
45. After applying Patch 4, the "SPNSXfr" migration tool checks if
the account name and password have enough privileges for
migration. If the username and password do not have enough
privileges, "SPNSXfr" uses the default local system account for
migration.
(163928 EN\_Hotfix\_3339)
46. When the OfficeScan server is installed using the "Domain name"
on a computer with multiple network cards, duplicate OfficeScan
client entries may be reported to the OfficeScan server after the
Connection Verification task has been processed.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.16 for
specific post-installation steps to resolve the issue.
(165770 EN\_Hotfix\_3339.1)
47. When OfficeScan quarantines a virus file to an OfficeScan
client's suspect folder but cannot send it to the server, the
notification email shows the "Cannot perform the Quarantine
action" message. This message is inaccurate since the virus file
was already quarantined on the client side.
(167311 EN\_Hotfix\_3342)
48. Trend Micro may release small CPR pattern files to detect new
malware before releasing the official pattern file. After
OfficeScan 8.0 clients load the small CPR pattern file, this
pattern file is removed automatically. Some customers want to
keep the small CPR pattern file for a longer period of time.
After applying Patch 4, OfficeScan will not remove the small
CPR pattern file immediately after loading. OfficeScan will
replace this small CPR pattern file only when users deploy a
new CPR pattern file from the OfficeScan server.
(166485 EN\_Hotfix\_3345)
49. The OfficeScanNT RealTime Scan service, "ntrtscan.exe", encounters
an application error when Spyware Scan Engine (SSAPI) components
attempt to access a shared resource at the same time.

allows users to enter recipient email addresses with an asterisk
(\*) on the OfficeScan Web console notifications page.
For example, "\*user@domain.com is permitted.
(167663 EN\_Hotfix\_3349)
52. Patch 4 enables the OfficeScan server to send the "active"
command to the Control Manager server during the following
events:
- when starting the OfficeScan server master service
- when sending status logs to the Control Manager server
This enhances the precision of the OfficeScan server
"active/inactive" status on the Control Manager server.
(168886 EN\_Hotfix\_3351)
53. OfficeScan clients originally cannot perform action on
spyware in a ".zip" file, this is due to the limitation of
the spyware scan engine. Patch 4 enables the virus scan
engine to assist in removing spyware from a ".zip" file.
After applying Patch 4, OfficeScan clients can successfully
remove spyware from ".zip" files.
Note: To support this function, users need to update the
virus scan engine to version 8.960.1005 or a later
version.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.18 for
detailed steps to enable "remove spyware from zip" function.
(168153 EN\_Hotfix\_3356)
54. A network traffic blockage occurs when the OfficeScan client
applies the "High" security level rule before applying the
exception rules on the firewall settings.
(167988 EN\_Hotfix\_3357)
55. Patch 4 provides an option to display the Web reputation (WR)
log category information on the OfficeScan server console.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.19 for
specific steps to configure the option.
(169706 EN\_Hotfix\_3359)
56. After applying Patch 4, CMAgent will send both the OfficeScan
client's computer name and IP address to the Control Manager
server for inclusion in the Web Policy Security Risk log. The
log will show both the client's computer name and IP address
in one field.
(165952 EN\_Hotfix\_3362)
57. Patch 4 prevents the inconsistency issue in the number of
registered OfficeScan clients by updating the MCP agent and CGI
programs.
Refer to the Post-installation Configuration section 6.2.20 for
detailed configuration steps to synchronize the client tree data
in the OfficeScan server database with the data in the Control
Manager server.
2.4 Resolved Known Issues in Patch 3.1
=====================================================================
Note: Patch 3.1 is a repack version of Patch 3. In addition to the
issues resolved by Patch 3, Patch 3.1 resolves the issue
wherein the OfficeScan client RealTime scan service may
encounter an application error when upgrading to OfficeScan
10.0. Refer to item 53 of this section for more information
regarding this issue.
Patch 3.1 resolves the following product issues:
1. When users attempt to manually install the OfficeScan client on
multiple unprotected computers, the OfficeScan client is installed
on the first computer only. This occurs when users use the Trend
Micro Vulnerability Scanner (TMVS) to scan for computers that are
not protected by an antivirus. The install status window shows
"ok" for all client computers even if the OfficeScan client is not
successfully installed on all client computers.
2. Patch 3.1 enhances the "OfficeScan client NT event log" function
to assign a different event ID for each type of event log.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.1 for
detailed configuration steps.
3. If several OfficeScan clients have the same GUID, the OfficeScan
server console displays only one of these clients.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.2 for
detailed configuration steps.
4. The OfficeScanNT RealTime Scan service, "ntrtscan.exe", encounters
an application error when performing a manual scan for
spyware/grayware.
5. The MCP sends all OfficeScan client information to Control Manager
even if only a part of the client information is changed.
6. The OfficeScan 8.0 client always extracts the help files when
the "Tmlisten.exe" service starts. This "Tmlisten.exe" to
takes a longer period of time to start up.
7. The OfficeScan 8.0 client shows the wrong release date in the
"Version Information" window. This issue occurs when a user
changes the "Language for non-Unicode programs" option to "Thai"
in the "Regional and Language Options" of the Control Panel.
8. Due to an error in the password setting of the Web Reputation
proxy server, OfficeScan does not recognize previously saved
passwords in the Web Reputation function. As a result, users
cannot enable the Web Reputation function.
9. When deploying the OfficeScan 8.0 license profile from Control
Manager, users get the following error message:
"The selected managed products do not have available license
profiles. Please contact Trend Micro support."
10. A migration failure issue occurs when the Normal Server of
the Trend Micro ServerProtect(TM) for Windows NT is migrated to
an OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 client.
11. The OfficeScan server uses GMT+0 when sending notification
messages through email. If the email program does not convert the
time to the local time, a user may not see the correct time on
the email message.
12. The OfficeScan MCP agent sends incorrect daylight saving time
information to the Control Manager server.
13. OfficeScan downloads all hot fix files again after performing an
OfficeScan client installation using an installation package
created by the Client Packager.
14. The OfficeScan client does receive updates regarding changes
to the scheduled scan configuration.
15. OfficeScan does not update the OfficeScan client information in
Control Manager. This occurs because status log 1.0 has a
different pattern format from status log 1.2.
16. Whenever the OfficeScan client starts up, it sends a Real-time
scan spyware/grayware log to the OfficeScan server even if the
OfficeScan client does not detect any spyware/grayware.
This issue triggers OfficeScan to update the date in the "Last
Time when Real Time Scan scan spyware" field, under client
status in the Web console, every time the OfficeScan client
restarts.
17. OfficeScan clients do not write event logs when the virus pattern
is not updated for a period of time.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.3 for
detailed configuration steps.
18. Patch 3.1 adds a feature that allows the OfficeScan NT firewall
to bypass unknown TCP network traffic.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.4 for
detailed configuration steps.
19. Patch 3.1 updates OfficeScan 8.0 clients to support Scheduled
Clean.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.5 for
detailed configuration steps.
20. Patch 3.1 adds an option that enables users to export
"Scan Exclusion Lists" information for the settings
of the following scans from the OfficeScan server console:
- Manual scans
- Real-time scans
- Scheduled scans
- Scan Now
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.6 for
detailed configuration steps.
21. In the OfficeScan client console, the "summary of file/object
scanned count" field in the "manual scan results" page displays
the wrong value.
22. The OfficeScan server and Control Manager report different
numbers of registered OfficeScan clients.
23. The Online Help does not mention that OfficeScan supports
"IP address" data, using token variable "%i", in spyware/grayware
standard notifications. The token "%s Computer with
spyware/grayware" does not work in the "subject" field of
spyware/grayware standard notifications.
24. Login Script Setup (AutoPcc.exe) does not support Windows User
Account Control (UAC).
25. The OfficeScan client Real-time scan service may stop responding
during a scheduled or manual scan if the spyware exclusion
settings are reloaded at the same time.
26. Even when users choose to update from customized update sources
and disable the "Update from OfficeScan server if all customized
sources are not available or not found" option, OfficeScan
clients still update from the OfficeScan server.
27. The "Resume a missed scheduled scan" function of "NTRtScan" does
not work properly. This issue occurs because after a user
restarts the OfficeScan client, "NTRtScan" does not properly
detect the daylight saving time (DST) settings. This triggers
"NTRtScan" to recalculate the time for the next scheduled scan.
28. "NTRtScan" stops responding when manual/scheduled scan and spyware
white list update are running at the same time.
29. When the OfficeScan server registers OfficeScan client data to
the Control Manager server, if the "unregister clients" action
occurs at the same time, the Control Manager server may not
successfully register some of the client data.
30. Patch 3.1 adds a function that enables OfficeScan clients to keep
the original Real-time scan enable/disable setting when
registering to the OfficeScan server. The server cannot change
the setting on the client side.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.7 for
detailed configuration steps.
31. When the OfficeScan client program starts, it resets the Windows
Firewall exception settings.
32. Patch 3.1 adds a function that enables OfficeScan clients to write
manual/scheduled scan information in the OfficeScan client
registry.
The following keys are created in
"HKLM\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\Misc":
- VirusManualScanDateTime (Manual Scan)
- VirusScheduleScanDateTime (Scheduled Scan)
- SpyManualScanDateTime (Manual Scan)
- SpyScheduleScanDateTime (Scheduled Scan)
- Virus/Malware Count (Reset to 0 before starting
manual/scheduled scan)
- Spyware/grayware count (Reset to 0 before starting
manual/scheduled scan)
33. A vulnerability issue exists in the NSC modules of the OfficeScan
server.
34. When two threads in "NTRTScan.exe" are referencing the same Scan
Context simultaneously, the computer encounters a serious error
and restarts.
35. Exported OfficeScan client ".csv" files on the Windows Server
2008 platform are recorded as "Win Server Longhorn".
36. The 64-bit OfficeScan clients cannot perform incremental pattern
updates. These OfficeScan clients always download the "VSAPI.zip"
file when performing a pattern update.
37. The Control Manager Agent (CMAgent)service normally waits for a
response from the Control Manager server before it is terminated.
However, if the Control Manager server is going through a shutdown
status or any similar network problem, CMAgent continues to wait
for the response from the Control Manager server without timing
out. As a result, CMAgent does not terminate properly.
38. Patch 3.1 adds a function that allows users to disable the
application filter function of the OfficeScan firewall.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.8 for
detailed configuration steps.
39. When the OfficeScan Monitor, "PccNTMon.exe" starts, it always
detects the Microsoft(TM) Internet Explorer(TM) proxy settings
for the Web Threat Protection feature even when the feature is
disabled.
40. Patch 3.1 updates the NSC to prevent the blue screen of death
(BSoD) issue caused by a stack overflow on a Windows system.
41. OfficeScan 7.x clients cannot upgrade to version 8.0 Service
Pack 1 Patch 1 when using the Client Packager tool.
42. After moving the OfficeScan server to another Control Manager
server, the OfficeScan server does not register client information
to the new Control Manager server. This issue occurs when the
CMAgent migration tool notifies the OfficeScan server to
unregister from an old Control Manager server and register to a
new Control Manager server.
43. When the following registry key is set to "1", access to the
floppy disk (drive A:\) is restricted to the user account that
is currently logged-in.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\
Winlogon\allocatefloppies
When OfficeScan manually scans the floppy disk, the "NTRtScan"
service cannot access the floppy disk because the "NTRtScan"
service uses a system account to scan.
44. The OfficeScan server console displays duplicate entries for
OfficeScan clients that use wireless LAN to connect to the
OfficeScan server.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.9 for
detailed configuration steps.
45. When the OfficeScan client is deployed using remote installation
to a computer running Symantec antivirus, the Symantec antivirus
program may not be deleted after installation. This issue
occurs when the computer running Symantec antivirus is logged-in
using a non-administrator account.
46. The OfficeScan client does not apply Web Reputation service
settings when switching back from offline status to online
status.
47. Patch 3.1 adds a function that enables OfficeScan clients to
scan for viruses in Windows safe mode.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.10 for
detailed configuration steps.
48. Patch 3.1 adds the TMProxy whitelist deployment feature.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.11 for
detailed configuration steps.
49. In OfficeScan 8.0, the name of the OfficeScan firewall service
is "OfficeScan NT Firewall". The name of this service in
OfficeScan 7.x is "OfficeScanNT Personal Firewall". After
upgrading a client from OfficeScan 7.x, the name of the firewall
service is still "OfficeScanNT Personal Firewall".
50. On a Windows Vista platform, when a user right clicks the
OfficeScan client icon, the pop-up menu may shift to a higher
position after a few seconds.
51. OfficeScan clients do not apply the correct firewall profile on
Windows 2008 servers that are assigned as domain controllers.
This issue occurs when the OfficeScan client deploys the
OfficeScan firewall profile using the platform server option.
52. Patch 3.1 adds the OfficeScan hot fix history feature by adding
hot fix information in the client side computer registry.
Note: This function needs a hot fix package's support. Previous
hot fixes do not have the ability to update the hot fix
history. This feature is added to hot fix packages that
are released after Patch 3.1.
53. When users upgrade from OfficeScan client version 8.0 to 10.0
using the "Update Now" function, the OfficeScan client Real-time
scan service may encounter an application error and stop
unexpectedly before the upgrade. However, the upgrade process
will still be successful.
54. After applying Patch 3.1, OfficeScan clients periodically detect
device mount points. When users add a local path to the exclusion
list, "NTRtScan.exe" automatically adds its corresponding device
name to the scanning exclusion list.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.3.12 for
specific steps to enable the automatic mount point detection
feature.
2.5 Resolved Known Issues in Patch 2
=====================================================================
Patch 2 resolves the following product issues:
1. When the "TmListen.exe" service starts, the IIS Administrator
Service that was previously stopped, also starts. This occurs
when "Tmlisten.exe" discovers that the IIS server and the
Microsoft Exchange server related folders are in the exclusion
list.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.2 for
detailed configuration steps.
2. When "TmListen.exe" starts, it lists all the IP addresses of the
local computer and picks a valid IP address that can connect to
the server.
To determine this IP address, "TmListen.exe" connects to the
server and sends the IP address list. The server then selects the
IP address and sends an index of this list.
"TmListen.exe" has a parsing boundary error that causes it to
access invalid elements of the IP array.
3. The OfficeScan MCP agent cannot register to the Control Manager
server. This issue occurs when users enable the IIS setting
"HTTP Compression" on the Control Manager server.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.3 for
detailed configuration steps.
4. The Control Manager one-time reports show the OfficeScan Common
Firewall Driver version as "0".
5. A migration failure issue occurs when the Normal Server of
the ServerProtect for Windows NT is migrated to an OfficeScan
8.0 Service Pack 1 client.
6. When OfficeScan 8.0 detects a virus in a multi-user environment,
such as Windows terminal service and Citrix environments, the
OfficeScan virus/malware log does not include information on the
user who is logged on to the computer at the time of virus
detection.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.4 for
detailed configuration steps.
7. On OfficeScan servers, users cannot submit Web Reputation
feedback from the "Web Reputation Policies" page by clicking the
following link:
http://reclassify.wrs.trendmicro.com/wrsonlinequery.aspx
8. Patch 2 adds a feature to the OfficeScan server to deny write
access to multiple Temporary Internet Files folders on a system.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.5 for
detailed configuration steps.
9. OfficeScan 8.0 users sometimes receive email notifications that
do not contain any virus or spyware/grayware information.
10. OfficeScan clients can be installed from the OfficeScan Web
console logon screen. The OfficeScan server utilizes several
ActiveX controls when deploying the product through the Web
console interface and the local machine caches these controls.
One of these controls, "objRemoveCtrl", is vulnerable to a
stack-based buffer overflow when embedded in a Web page.
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a victim
into viewing a malicious Web page. A successful exploit will
allow attacker-supplied code to run in the context of the
currently logged-on user.
11. There is a logon password authentication bypass vulnerability in
the OfficeScan Web console. When the OfficeScan administrator
logs on, an attacker can illegally access the password
authentication token and take full control of the Web console.
12. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the OfficeScan
server CGI program, "cgiRecvFile.exe".
13. A vulnerability in the OfficeScan CGI modules may allow
attackers to trigger a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary
code using Web user privileges.
14. A vulnerability in the OfficeScan CGI modules may allow
attackers to trigger a null pointer defect and cause the
target child process to close. This can potentially cause
denial of service conditions.
15. The OfficeScan Update Agent client can receive requests from
other clients. For update file distribution, the request format
is "/activeupdate/".
When the OfficeScan Update Agent client complies with this
request, it can recognize and resolve the update file path
but does not verify it. As a result, if an attacker changes
the path to the directory traversal format, the following occur:
- directory traversal
- disclosure of file contents
16. A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when an HTTP request with
specially crafted form data is sent to the OfficeScan server
CGI modules.
17. "TmListen.exe" monitors changes to the IP and the IP route table.
Any change to the IP route table is an event signaled by the
Windows operating system. Frequent changes to the IP route
table triggers the OfficeScan client to infinitely reapply
firewall policy, which impacts network usage.
18. Patch 2 adds the short name format to the OfficeScan clients'
cache structure. After installing Patch 2, OfficeScan will send
virus pattern numbers in the short name format.
19. When the OfficeScan 8.0 server shuts down, the OfficeScan
8.0 MCP agent does not terminate correctly. In this case,
there is a chance that the previously registered OfficeScan 8.0
clients might be unregistered.
Patch 2 updates the OfficeScan 8.0 MCP agent event handler. This
prevents the "client count" value on the Control Manager console
from going down to "0" after the OfficeScan 8.0 server reboots.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.6 for
detailed configuration steps.
20. Patch 2 updates the OfficeScan components to allow the
OfficeScan server to remotely install OfficeScan 8.0 Service
Pack 1 to multiple client computers.
21. The OfficeScan server status log shows an incorrect DNS domain
name. This issue occurs because the OfficeScan MCP agent sends
the Windows network domain name instead of the DNS domain name
to the Control Manager server.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.7 for
detailed configuration steps.
22. OfficeScan 8.0 and OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 clients are
recognized as "Non-Upgraded" clients in the Web console
under "Anti-Virus only" mode.
23. The "TmListen.exe" service may not start because of an
unhandled exception during service startup.
24. Patch 2 updates the OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 1 NT
Proxy Service component with new NSC. This component adds an
approved Web site list feature that allows connection to certain
blocked Web sites.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.8 for
detailed configuration steps.
25. Patch 2 updates the OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 1 NT
Firewall component with NSC 5.3. After applying Patch 2, users
can delay the startup of the OfficeScan firewall service based
on a particular time frame.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.9 for
detailed configuration steps.
26. Patch 2 updates the OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 1
Common Firewall Driver with NSC Edition 5.3. This component adds
a function for handling ICMP broadcast responses.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.10 for
detailed configuration steps.
27. The OfficeScan 8.0 client stops responding when the URL in the
Web Reputation log details is too long.
28. The OfficeScan 8.0 MCP agent sends all registered product
licenses to the Control Manager. The different expiration
dates of the product licenses causes confusion in Control
Manager.
29. When daylight saving time (DST) is disabled or enabled, the
OfficeScan client scheduled scan might shift an hour earlier.
30. The "NonSynProxySetting" was originally created for existing
OfficeScan clients. New OfficeScan clients may still synchronize
intranet proxy settings with the OfficeScan server when the
OfficeScan clients start up for the first time. This occurs
because new clients retrieve intranet proxy settings before
checking the "NonSynProxySetting" setting.
After applying Patch 2, the "NonSynProxySetting" setting works
on newly installed clients.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.11 for
detailed configuration steps.
31. Patch 2 updates the OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 firewall
component with NSC 5.3. This component corrects the following
issues:
\* The Outbound network performance slowed down.
\* Movie streaming cannot be performed when the Web Reputation
Service is enabled.
\* The Web Reputation Service blocks the network stream used by
webcams.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.12 for
detailed configuration steps.
32. OfficeScan does not support the OfficeScan Image Setup Utility,
"ImgSetup.exe", on 64-bit platforms.
33. Patch 2 modifies the tool tip description of the "Resume a
missed scheduled scan" setting in the OfficeScan server console.
34. The OfficeScan server "\PCCSRV\Download\Pattern" folder size
steadily increases because IIS locks old pattern files.
OfficeScan cannot remove these old pattern files automatically
when the OfficeScan server performs ActiveUpdate.
35. The OfficeScan server tries to notify the update agents first
before the normal OfficeScan clients. Under certain conditions,
when the OfficeScan server does not notify an update agent,
OfficeScan does not resolve the error. When this occurs, normal
OfficeScan clients are not notified.
36. The following error message appears when users click
"Firewall -> Profiles" in the OfficeScan server Web console.
"A Runtime Error has occurred. Do you wish to Debug?
Line:199
Error: 'form.pfw\_profile\_chkVista\_' is null or not an object"
This issue occurs because OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 1
does not use the "form.pfw\_profile\_chkVista\_" object.
37. When OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 1 runs on Apache(TM)
servers, the OfficeScan watchdog sends event description logs
that are incorrectly encoded to the OfficeScan server.
38. Patch 2 enables the Trend Micro Vulnerability Scanner tool
to detect Trend Micro Internet Security(TM) 2008 and 2009.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.13 for
detailed configuration steps.
39. OfficeScan client scheduled updates do not start on time if the
updates are scheduled as "Weekly, every Sunday".
40. On the server Web console, when the global spyware/grayware
Scheduled Scan action is set to "pass" and an administrator sets
a particular client's spyware/grayware Scheduled Scan action to
"clean", the settings cannot be saved. The next time an
administrator checks the scan settings on the server Web console,
neither "pass" nor "clean" is selected.
41. At times, the OfficeScan MCP sends client status logs
unnecessarily, which adds more work load for the Control Manager
server.
42. The OfficeScan clients Real-time Scan service starts and stops
repeatedly. When the Real-time Scan service is started, it begins
scanning the process image. If the Real-time Scan service is
forced to stop during a scan, it encounters a memory leak problem.
This occurs because the manual scan context deinitialization is
not properly called.
43. The OfficeScan client virus/malware log shows "TSC\_GENCLEAN" as
the name of any virus/malware cleaned by the OfficeScan client
GeneriClean function.
44. A virus pattern version number has both long and short name
formats. When the OfficeScan MCP agent service, "OfcCMAgent.exe"
sends the virus pattern version to the Control Manager server,
the long name format is used. This results in the exclusion of
the Virus Pattern information from virus logs when queried on the
Control Manager database.
45. The OfficeScan server online license checking shows the
OfficeScan license as "expired" after the system time zone is
set to (GMT+2, Windhoek). This issue occurs when users make
this change in time zone while the "Automatically adjust clock
to daylight saving changes" option is selected.
46. When the OfficeScan 8.0 server is installed on a Windows 2003
Server with IIS6, the OfficeScan server may be unable to perform
pattern updates. This may lead to "server.ini" file truncation.
47. When the OfficeScan client Web reputation function blocks a URL,
a pop-up message alert notifies the users of the Web security
violation. Users can click the pop-up message body to send the
URL information to Trend Micro. In cases where the URL exceeds
500 characters, the OfficeScan client "PccNTMon.exe" process
may encounter an application error.
48. Some users cannot install the OfficeScan client by Web
installation method. When users click the "Install Now" button
during Web installation, the Web page refreshes as a blank page
and the OfficeScan installation does not proceed.
49. The OfficeScan 8.0 MCP agent sends Common Firewall Pattern
information to the Control Manager server even if the OfficeScan
firewall is disabled.
50. A handle leak issue occurs when the OfficeScan client
program is running continuously for two to three days.
51. When OfficeScan 8.0 manually scans the local hard disk for
boot virus, the scan results show "delete" but the boot virus
was not cleaned or deleted.
52. When OfficeScan 8.0 manually scans the local hard disk for
boot virus, there are no virus or spyware logs for the manual
scan results in the OfficeScan client console.
53. ActiveUpdate creates a temporary folder in "C:\Temp" even when
users assign another folder for saving temporary data using the
"$TMP" or "$TEMP" environment variable.
54. When users enable daylight saving time (DST) on the OfficeScan
server, OfficeScan returns incorrect results when users query
malware/spyware/firewall/Web reputation logs.
55. Each time a rule is modified, the OfficeScan firewall saves the
new rule in both the computer memory and rule file. This uses a
large amount of CPU resources.
Patch 2 modifies the OfficeScan firewall rule-writing
mechanism. After applying Patch 2, the OfficeScan firewall
checks for rule updates specified in the registry key at regular
intervals (user-defined). OfficeScan only modifies the rule file
if the rules were updated during the time interval.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.4.14 for
detailed configuration steps.
56. Patch 2 modifies the way the Trend Micro Rootkit Common Module
obtains a function pointer from the Windows kernel to resolve
an issue that causes the computer to stop responding. This issue
affects only computers that install the MS08-064 Windows update
on top of the MS07-022 update.
57. Due to an error in the password setting of the Web Reputation
proxy server, OfficeScan does not recognize previously saved
passwords in the Web Reputation function. As a result, users
cannot enable the Web Reputation function.
2.6 Resolved Known Issues in Patch 1
=====================================================================
Patch 1 resolves the following product issues:
1. The client's "TmListen.exe" and "NTRtScan.exe" processes cannot
reference a setting on the OfficeScan initialization file. The
setting assigns the registry key values that dictate whether or
not the OfficeScan Watchdog service will be launched.
2. The OfficeScanNT Real-time Scan service, "ntrtscan.exe",
sometimes cannot load the Spyware/Grayware Approved List, which
causes OfficeScan to scan and perform actions on applications
and files included in the list.
3. OfficeScan sends a notification message with inaccurate results
when the OfficeScan client cannot move files from the suspect
folder to the quarantine folder.
4. When an administrator specifies the OfficeScan client's update
source in Universal Naming Convention (UNC) format, clients
cannot update from the update source.
5. When using Control Manager 5.0 Agent Migration tool to move
OfficeScan 8.0 CMAgent to a new Control Manager server,
single-sign-on (SSO) function does not work, unless the
OfficeScan 8.0 CMAgent service is restarted.
6. When OfficeScan deploys Real-time Scan, Manual Scan, Scan Now,
or Scheduled Scan settings from the OfficeScan Web console
root level, the OfficeScan server setting overrides the
OfficeScan client local exclusion folder setting.
Refer to Post-Installation Configuration section 6.5 for
detailed configuration steps.
7. When the OfficeScan server performs remote client installation,
it maps the target computer's drive as a local drive. If the
installation fails, the mapped drive is not disconnected, thus
keeping the drive slot occupied. Administrators may see a lot of
mapped drives on the OfficeScan server computer.
8. The event notification will not be triggered when deploying the
"enable/disable real-time scan" command from Control Manager to
OfficeScan 8.0.
9. The OfficeScan client's "PccNTMon" process may stop responding
when uploading a large file to the quarantine directory.
10. The OfficeScan CMAgent service sometimes does not stop correctly
and encounters a code 1064 error.
11. When users use the "svrsvcsetup.exe -enablessl" command to enable
SSL, the "Master\_SSLPort" and "Master\_EnableSSL" keys in the
"ofcscan.ini" file do not synchronize with "SSLPort" and
"EnableSSL" in the "OfUninst.ini" file. Customers would then have
to manually edit the "ofcscan.ini" file.
12. The status of the OfficeScan client does not change to "online"
after VPN connection is established.
13. After disabling the "Include roaming client(s)" feature on the
"Manual Update" screen, the feature is still enabled the next
time a user visits the screen.
14. After changing an OfficeScan client's IP address, the OfficeScan
server's Web console displays the wrong client IP address.
15. The "Windows 2008" platform is unavailable as an option in the
"Firewall Profile Setting" page of the OfficeScan Web console.
16. The OfficeScan client displays an incorrect error message for a
download error that occurs while scanning email messages in
Microsoft Outlook(TM).
17. A false-alarm issue may be encountered in the OfficeScan
firewall's Intrusion Defense System (IDS).
18. Incorrect service pack version information is displayed when
OfficeScan clients check component information.

========================================================================
Install this patch only on OfficeScan 8.0 servers with ONE of the
following installed:
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 1
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 2
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 3.1
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 4
5. Installation/Un-installation
========================================================================
5.1. Installation Notes
=====================================================================
1. Ensure that the OfficeScan server runs ONE of the following:
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 1
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 2
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 3.1
- OfficeScan 8.0 Service Pack 1 Patch 4
2. This patch includes updates to the OfficeScan Common Firewall
and TMTDI (used by Web Reputation function) Drivers. Users can
choose to install this patch without updating these drivers. If
you choose to update these drivers, take note of the following
client computer disruptions when you proceed to install this
patch:
a. When the patch is deployed to clients and the Common Firewall
Driver update starts, client computers will be temporarily
disconnected from the network. Users are not notified before
disconnection.
b. After the patch is deployed, the driver's previous version
may still exist on client computers.
If this happens, the new version will not be loaded until the
computer is restarted. Users are likely to encounter problems
with the OfficeScan client if they do not restart
immediately.
If the option to display the restart notification message is
enabled on the Web console, users will be prompted to
restart. However, users who decide to postpone the restart
are not prompted again. If the option is disabled, users are
not notified at all.
The option to display the restart notification message is
enabled by default. To check the status of this option,
open the Web console, go to "Networked Computers >
Global Client Settings" and check the option under
"Alert Settings".
Inform all users in advance about the computer disconnection and
that they need to restart their computers immediately if
prompted by OfficeScan.
Install this patch when the impact of these client computer
disruptions to your organization is minimal.
Note : The updates to the Common Firewall and TMTDI Drivers in this
patch are optional. Users can choose to install this patch
without updating the drivers. If the patch is installed on
the OfficeScan server without updating the drivers, users
can launch the patch package again at a later time to update
the drivers.
3. Updating the Common Firewall Driver also resets all port
configurations and disconnects all applications. Applications
that can reconnect on their own will be automatically
reconnected. For applications that cannot reconnect, perform
manual reconnection.
4. The OfficeScan server cannot install this patch if a client is
running Login Script (AutoPcc.exe) at the time of installation.
Ensure that no client is running Login Script before installing
this patch.
5. Installing this patch automatically restarts the OfficeScan
Master Service and Web service (World Wide Web Publishing
Service or Apache 2 Service). Do not install this patch when an
important task, such as a component update is running.
6. OPTIONAL: Back up the OfficeScan database. You can do this from
the Web console, in "Administration > Database Backup".
5.2. Installation

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open the "ofcscan.ini" file in the "\PCCSRV\" folder of the
OfficeScan server.
2. Under the "[Global Setting]" section, add the value of your
choice.
[Global Setting]
PSKeepLocalExcludeFolder=x --> for Scheduled Scan exclusion
MSKeepLocalExcludeFolder=x --> for Manual Scan exclusion
RTKeepLocalExcludeFolder=x --> for Real-time Scan exclusion
SNKeepLocalExcludeFolder=x --> for Scan Now exclusion
Where "x" can be:
"1" - Exclusion folder setting will not be overwritten by
the server's setting.
"0" - Exclusion folder setting will be overwritten by the
server's setting.
3. On the OfficeScan server Web console, navigate to
"Networked Computers > Global Client Settings" and click "Save".
4. Open the Registry Editor and perform the following:
a. Navigate to "HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\TrendMicro\
PC-cillinNTCorp\CurrentVersion\".
b. Click the key of the scan type you configured in step 2.
\* Manual Scan Configuration
\* Prescheduled Scan Configuration
\* Real Time Scan Configuration

KeepLocalExcludeFolder=1"
7. Known Issues
========================================================================
1. Installing this patch automatically restarts the OfficeScan Master
Service and Web service (World Wide Web Publishing service or
Apache 2 service). Do not install this patch when an important
task, such as a component update, is running.
2. Updating the Common Firewall Driver resets all port configurations
and disconnects all applications. Applications that can reconnect
on their own will be reconnected automatically. For applications
that cannot reconnect, perform manual reconnection.
3. The administrator will not be able to remotely install OfficeScan
client to Windows 7 x86 platforms without enabling the default
administrator account. To resolve this issue:
Note: Enable the Remote Registry service on the Windows 7 machine.
By default, Windows 7 machines disables this feature.
Option A: Use the domain administrator account to remotely install
OfficeScan 10 Service Pack 1 clients to Windows 7
computers.
Option B: Use the default administrator account:
a. Type the "net user administrator /active:yes" command from
the command console to enable the default administrator
account.
b. Use the default administrator account to remotely install the
OfficeScan client to the Windows 7 machine.
4. Installing OfficeScan clients to Windows 7 in VMware may cause the
system to stop responding. This is because of compatibility issues
with the Intel(TM) Network Adapter Driver.
