Package        : postgresql-8.3
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-0442 CVE-2010-1169 CVE-2010-1170 CVE-2010-1975

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an
object-relational SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-1169

    Tim Bunce discovered that the implementation of the procedural
    language PL/Perl insufficiently restricts the subset of allowed
    code, which allows authenticated users the execution of arbitrary
    Perl code.

CVE-2010-1170

    Tom Lane discovered that the implementation of the procedural
    language PL/Tcl insufficiently restricts the subset of allowed
    code, which allows authenticated users the execution of arbitrary
    Tcl code.

CVE-2010-1975

    It was discovered that an unprivileged user could reset
    superuser-only parameter settings.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.3.11-0lenny1. This update also introduces a fix for
CVE-2010-0442, which was originally scheduled for the next Lenny point
update.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.4.4-1 of postgresql-8.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.3 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

We're following vulndisco stuff although it's a bit of a pain.

Use CVE-2010-0442

Changes:
 postgresql-8.3 (8.3.10-0lenny1) stable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream bug fix release:
     - Add new configuration parameter ssl_renegotiation_limit to control
       how often we do session key renegotiation for an SSL connection.
       This can be set to zero to disable renegotiation completely, which
       may be required if a broken SSL library is used. In particular,
       some vendors are shipping stopgap patches for [CVE-2009-3555](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555) that
       cause renegotiation attempts to fail.
     - Fix possible deadlock during backend startup.
     - Fix possible crashes due to not handling errors during relcache
       reload cleanly.
     - Fix possible crash due to use of dangling pointer to a cached plan.
     - Fix possible crashes when trying to recover from a failure in
       subtransaction start.
     - Fix server memory leak associated with use of savepoints and a
       client encoding different from server's encoding.
     - Fix incorrect WAL data emitted during end-of-recovery cleanup of a
       GIST index page split.
       This would result in index corruption, or even more likely an error
       during WAL replay, if we were unlucky enough to crash during
       end-of-recovery cleanup after having completed an incomplete GIST
       insertion.
     - Make substring() for bit types treat any negative length as meaning
       "all the rest of the string".
       The previous coding treated only -1 that way, and would produce an
       invalid result value for other negative values, possibly leading to
       a crash ([CVE-2010-0442](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0442)). (Closes: #[567058](bugreport.cgi?bug=567058))
     - Fix integer-to-bit-string conversions to handle the first
       fractional byte correctly when the output bit width is wider than
       the given integer by something other than a multiple of 8 bits.
     - Fix some cases of pathologically slow regular expression matching.
     - Fix assorted crashes in xml processing caused by sloppy memory
       management.
       This is a back-patch of changes first applied in 8.4. The 8.3 code
       was known buggy, but the new code was sufficiently different to not
       want to back-patch it until it had gotten some field testing.
     - Fix bug with trying to update a field of an element of a
       composite-type array column.
     - Fix the STOP WAL LOCATION entry in backup history files to report
       the next WAL segment's name when the end location is exactly at a
       segment boundary.
     - Fix some more cases of temporary-file leakage.
       This corrects a problem introduced in the previous minor release.
       One case that failed is when a plpgsql function returning set is
       called within another function's exception handler.
     - Improve constraint exclusion processing of boolean-variable cases,
       in particular make it possible to exclude a partition that has a
       "bool_column = false" constraint.
     - When reading "pg_hba.conf" and related files, do not treat
       @something as a file inclusion request if the @ appears inside
       quote marks; also, never treat @ by itself as a file inclusion
       request.
       This prevents erratic behavior if a role or database name starts
       with @. If you need to include a file whose path name contains
       spaces, you can still do so, but you must write @"/path to/file"
       rather than putting the quotes around the whole construct.
     - Prevent infinite loop on some platforms if a directory is named as
       an inclusion target in "pg_hba.conf" and related files.
     - Fix possible infinite loop if SSL_read or SSL_write fails without
       setting errno.
       This is reportedly possible with some Windows versions of openssl.
     - Disallow GSSAPI authentication on local connections, since it
       requires a hostname to function correctly.
     - Make ecpg report the proper SQLSTATE if the connection disappears.
     - Fix psql's numericlocale option to not format strings it shouldn't
       in latex and troff output formats.
     - Make psql return the correct exit status (3) when ON_ERROR_STOP and
       --single-transaction are both specified and an error occurs during
       the implied "COMMIT".
     - Fix plpgsql failure in one case where a composite column is set to
       NULL.
     - Fix possible failure when calling PL/Perl functions from PL/PerlU
       or vice versa.
     - Add volatile markings in PL/Python to avoid possible
       compiler-specific misbehavior.
     - Ensure PL/Tcl initializes the Tcl interpreter fully.
       The only known symptom of this oversight is that the Tcl clock
       command misbehaves if using Tcl 8.5 or later.
     - Prevent crash in "contrib/dblink" when too many key columns are
       specified to a dblink_build_sql_- function.
     - Allow zero-dimensional arrays in "contrib/ltree" operations.
       This case was formerly rejected as an error, but it's more
       convenient to treat it the same as a zero-element array. In
       particular this avoids unnecessary failures when an ltree operation
       is applied to the result of ARRAY(SELECT ...) and the sub-select
       returns no rows.
     - Fix assorted crashes in "contrib/xml2" caused by sloppy memory
       management.
   * Add 00cvs-unregister-ssl-callbacks.patch: Properly unregister OpenSSL
     callbacks when libpq is done with it's connection. Thanks Ondřej Surý for

The connection to the server was lost. Attempting reset: Succeeded.      The log shows: ... LOG:  server process (PID 14481) was terminated by signal 11 LOG:  terminating any other active server processes WARNING:  terminating connection because of crash of another server process DETAIL:  The postmaster has commanded this server process to roll back the current transaction and exit, because another server process exited abnormally and possibly corrupted shared memory.

Contact your support representative if you need to escalate this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=559194#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2010-03-22 09:43:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=559194#c1))  > an attacker wouldn't have much control over what got copied where.      An attacker has control over prefix of what (taken from SQL query, specified by attacker as a stream of 0s and 1s, that is turned into bytes), where is somewhat predictable (after the buffer allocated on heap), the biggest problem is how much, as this is integer underflow, resulting in a long memory copy triggering SEGV before overwritten memory is used.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=559194#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-04-26 18:16:58 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 586059](show_bug.cgi?id=586059) ***   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hm, yeah, somebody was sloppy about exposing the three-argument
form of varbit substring and using -1 to represent the two-argument
form.

What we can do in the back branches is make the code treat any
negative value as meaning two-arg form. To throw an error we'd
need to refactor the pg\_proc representation ...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Log Message:
-----------
Make bit/varbit substring() treat any negative length as meaning "all the rest
of the string". The previous coding treated only -1 that way, and would
produce an invalid result value for other negative values.

We ought to fix it so that 2-parameter bit substring() is a different C
function and the 3-parameter form throws error for negative length, but
that takes a pg\_proc change which is impractical in the back branches;
and in any case somebody might be relying on -1 working this way.
So just do this as a back-patchable fix.

# postgresql-8.1 8.1.20-0ubuntu0.6.06.1 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
postgresql-8.1 (8.1.20-0ubuntu0.6.06.1) dapper-security; urgency=low

  * no change rebuild for -security

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.20-0ubuntu0.6.06) dapper-proposed; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release: (LP: [#557408](/bugs/557408))
    - Add new configuration parameter ssl_renegotiation_limit to control
      how often we do session key renegotiation for an SSL connection.
      This can be set to zero to disable renegotiation completely, which
      may be required if a broken SSL library is used. In particular,
      some vendors are shipping stopgap patches for CVE-2009-3555 that
      cause renegotiation attempts to fail.
    - Fix possible crashes when trying to recover from a failure in
      subtransaction start.
    - Fix server memory leak associated with use of savepoints and a
      client encoding different from server's encoding.
    - Make substring() for bit types treat any negative length as meaning
      "all the rest of the string".
      The previous coding treated only -1 that way, and would produce an
      invalid result value for other negative values, possibly leading to
      a crash (CVE-2010-0442).
    - Fix integer-to-bit-string conversions to handle the first
      fractional byte correctly when the output bit width is wider than
      the given integer by something other than a multiple of 8 bits.
    - Fix some cases of pathologically slow regular expression matching.
    - Fix the STOP WAL LOCATION entry in backup history files to report
      the next WAL segment's name when the end location is exactly at a
      segment boundary.
    - Fix some more cases of temporary-file leakage.
      This corrects a problem introduced in the previous minor release.
      One case that failed is when a plpgsql function returning set is
      called within another function's exception handler.
    - When reading "pg_hba.conf" and related files, do not treat
      @something as a file inclusion request if the @ appears inside
      quote marks; also, never treat @ by itself as a file inclusion
      request.
      This prevents erratic behavior if a role or database name starts
      with @. If you need to include a file whose path name contains
      spaces, you can still do so, but you must write @"/path to/file"
      rather than putting the quotes around the whole construct.
    - Prevent infinite loop on some platforms if a directory is named as
      an inclusion target in "pg_hba.conf" and related files.
    - Fix psql's numericlocale option to not format strings it shouldn't
      in latex and troff output formats.
    - Fix plpgsql failure in one case where a composite column is set to
      NULL.
    - Add volatile markings in PL/Python to avoid possible
      compiler-specific misbehavior.
    - Prevent crash in "contrib/dblink" when too many key columns are
      specified to a dblink_build_sql_- function.
    - Fix assorted crashes in "contrib/xml2" caused by sloppy memory
      management.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-27 15:33:26 UTC  ``` Intevydis reported a buffer overflow in PostgreSQL's implementation of substring() function when called with negative length argument:   <http://intevydis.blogspot.com/2010/01/postgresql-8023-bitsubstr-overflow.html>  Following query triggers overflow / crash:   select substring(B'10101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101',33,-15);   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-27 15:35:00 UTC  ``` Looks like Tom patched this upstream few days ago: <http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=75dea10196c31d98d98c0bafeeb576ae99c09b12> <http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=b15087cb39ca9e4bde3c8920fcee3741045d2b83>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-27 20:54:30 UTC  ``` Tom noted this in [bug #559194#c1](show_bug.cgi?id=559194#c1 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - PostgreSQL 8.0.23 bitsubstr overflow"):  "We didn't consider this especially serious upstream, since AFAICS it'd be difficult to exploit it for anything more than a crash --- an attacker wouldn't have much control over what got copied where."  We would need to determine whether or not this just kills the current active connection, or whether it kills all connections to the database.  If it is the former, and there is no chance of anything more than a crash, then I don't think we would consider it any more security relevant than typing '\q' at the pgsql command prompt.  Tom, would you happen to know the answer to the above by chance?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-27 21:00:41 UTC  ``` Sorry for the noise, I just saw this:  | LOG:  server process (PID 24968) was terminated by signal 11: Segmentation fault | LOG:  terminating any other active server processes | WARNING:  terminating connection because of crash of another server process   looks like it would indeed take out any other active processes.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c4)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-27 22:03:17 UTC  ``` Tom,  Do you know if this affects all versions of postgresql? I just took a look at the version in RHEL3, the logic is different, I've not tried a reproducer yet (I need to get postgresql running there first).  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c5)  Tom Lane    2010-01-27 22:09:10 UTC  ``` Yeah, that logic was the same all the way back to PG 7.1.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c6)  Tom Lane    2010-01-27 22:11:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c2)) > We would need to determine whether or not this just kills the current active > connection, or whether it kills all connections to the database.  In general, any process crash kills all connections to a PG database --- part of the crash recovery strategy is to kill all active connections and restart.  In some cases that would be overly conservative, but nobody upstream is particularly interested in trying to analyze when it might be safe to do less.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-27 23:48:34 UTC  ``` This has been assigned the name [CVE-2010-0442](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0442).   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-19 15:48:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2010:0427 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0427.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-19 16:15:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0428 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0428.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-19 16:30:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0429 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0429.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2010-12-20 16:22:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=559259#c1)) > Looks like Tom patched this upstream few days ago: > <http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=75dea10196c31d98d98c0bafeeb576ae99c09b12> > <http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=b15087cb39ca9e4bde3c8920fcee3741045d2b83>  Looks like these links are no longer valid after final CVS->git migration upstream.
