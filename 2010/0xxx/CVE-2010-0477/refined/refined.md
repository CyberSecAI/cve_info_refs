  "CVE-2010-0477": {
    "description": "An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation handles specially crafted SMB responses. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the system.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation improperly handles specially crafted SMB responses that cause the SMB client to consume the entire response and indicate an invalid value to the Winsock kernel.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of specially crafted SMB responses",
        "Invalid value passed to Winsock kernel"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Most attempts to exploit this vulnerability will cause an affected system to stop responding and restart.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Hosting a specially crafted SMB server designed to exploit the vulnerability, and convincing a user to initiate an SMB connection with it.",
        "Man-in-the-middle attack on the local network to respond to a legitimate SMB request with a malformed SMB response."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted SMB server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the local network. No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability."
