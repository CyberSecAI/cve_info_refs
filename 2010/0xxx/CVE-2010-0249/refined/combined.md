## Microsoft Internet Explorer HTML object memory corruption vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#492515

Original Release Date: 2010-01-14 | Last Revised: 2010-01-21

---

### Overview

An invalid pointer reference within Microsoft Internet Explorer may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer contains a memory corruption vulnerability, which can result in an invalid pointer being accessed after an object is incorrectly initialized or has been deleted. In certain circumstances, the invalid pointer access can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is being actively exploited, and exploit code is publically available.  Please see Microsoft Security Advisory [979352](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/979352.mspx) for further information. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to load a specially crafted HTML document or Microsoft Office document, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Microsoft has released an update to address the issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS10-002](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-002.mspx) for more information. Users are encouraged to consider additional mitigations listed in Microsoft Security Advisory [979352](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/979352.mspx): |
| --- |

| **Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) on Internet Explorer 6 or Internet Explorer 7**  Microsoft has published [more information](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2010/01/18/additional-information-about-dep-and-the-internet-explorer-0day-vulnerability.aspx) on DEP as a mitigation for this vulnerability. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but DEP can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). Use of DEP should be considered in conjunction with other mitigations described in this document.**Set the Internet zone security setting to "High"**Setting the Internet zone security setting to "High" will result in the user being prompted before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting, which may reduce the risk of certain attack vectors.**Disable Active Scripting**Disabling Active Scripting will prevent Active Scripting from running, which may reduce the risk of certain attack vectors.**Disable ActiveX Controls in Microsoft Office**This vulnerability can be exploited through a Microsoft Office document containing an ActiveX control. Disabling ActiveX controls in Microsoft Office blocks this attack vector. For detailed instructions on how to disable ActiveX in Microsoft Office, see the "Workarounds" section of Microsoft Security Advisory [979352](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/979352.mspx) and the "Enable or disable ActiveX controls in Office documents" Microsoft Office Online [article](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA100310671033.aspx). |

Published: January 21, 2010 | Updated: February 10, 2010

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves seven privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The more severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Internet Explorer: Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 (except Internet Explorer 6 for supported editions of Windows Server 2003). For Internet Explorer 6 for supported editions of Windows Server 2003 as listed, this update is rated Moderate. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, validates input parameters, and filters HTML attributes. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 979352](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/979352).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

#### FAQ for XSS Filter Script Handling Vulnerability - CVE-2009-4074

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability either by constructing a specially crafted Web page or posting specially crafted content to a legitimate Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause script code to run on the machine of another user in the guise of a third-party Web site. Such script code would run inside the browser when visiting the third-party Web site, and could take any action on the user's computer that the third-party Web site was permitted to take. The vulnerability could only be exploited if the user clicked on a hypertext link, either in an HTML e-mail or if the user visited an attacker's Web site or a Web site containing content that is under the attackerâs control.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer, under certain circumstances, disables an HTML attribute in otherwise appropriately filtered response data. As a result, a specially crafted Web page could be loaded in such a way that an attacker could execute script in the context of the logged-on user in a different Internet domain.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause script code to run on the machine of another user in the guise of a third-party Web site. Such script code would run inside the browser when visiting the third-party Web site, and could take any action on the user's computer that the third-party Web site was permitted to take. The vulnerability could only be exploited if the user clicked on a hypertext link, either in an HTML e-mail or if the user visited an attacker's Web site or a Web site containing content that is under the attackerâs control.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could post specially crafted content, designed to exploit this vulnerability, on to an affected Web site. The attacker must then convince the user to view the content on the Web site. When the user browses to the legitimate Web site, the XSS filter disables HTML attributes in the crafted content, creating a condition that could allow malicious script to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

A user must be logged on and visiting a Web site for malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations and terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by preventing the XSS filter in Internet Explorer from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## URL Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0027

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer incorrectly validates input. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted URL. When a user clicks the URL, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0027](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0027).

#### Mitigating Factors for URL Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0027

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4, Internet Explorer 6.0, and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for URL Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0027

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been initialized or has been deleted, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**Which of the workarounds should I apply to my system in order to be protected?**

Based on our investigation, setting the Internet zone security setting to **High** will protect users from the issue described in this advisory.

**How does configuring the Internet zone security setting to High protect me from this vulnerability?**

Setting the Internet zone security setting to **High** protects against this vulnerability by disabling scripting, disabling less secure features in Internet Explorer, and blocking known techniques used to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

**How does Protected Mode in Internet Explorer on Windows** **Vista** **and later Windows operating systems limit the impact of this vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer in Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems runs in [Protected Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/ie7-protected-mode.aspx) by default in the Internet security zone. (Protected Mode is off by default in the Intranet zone.) Protected Mode significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to write, alter, or destroy data on the userâs machine or to install malicious code. This is accomplished by using the integrity mechanisms of Windows Vista which restrict access to processes, files, and registry keys with higher integrity levels.

**What is Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)?**

Systems implementing Address Space Layout Randomization relocate normally-predictable function entry points pseudo-randomly in memory. Windows ASLR re-bases DLL or EXE into one of 256 random locations in memory. Therefore, attackers using hardcoded addresses are likely to "guess correctly" one in 256 times. For more information regarding ASLR, visit the TechNet magazine article, [Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part 3](https://technet.microsoft.com/magazine/2007.04.vistakernel.aspx?pr=blog).

**What is Data Execution Prevention (DEP)?**

Data Execution Prevention support is included in Internet Explorer, and although on by default for Internet Explorer 8, is off by default for earlier versions of Internet Explorer. DEP is designed to help foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable. For more information about DEP in Internet Explorer, please see the MSDN blog post, [IE8 Security Part I: DEP/NX Memory Protection](https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-i_3a00_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx).

**Can Data Execution Prevention (DEP) be bypassed in Internet Explorer 8?**

There is a report of a new Data Execution Prevention (DEP) exploit. We have analyzed the proof-of-concept exploit code and have found that Windows Vista and later versions of Windows offer more effective protections in blocking the exploit due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). On Windows XP, attackers could make the bypass techniques more reliable.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0245

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0245](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0245).

#### Mitigating Factors for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0245

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, and Internet Explorer 7 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0245

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**Which of the workarounds should I apply to my system in order to be protected?**

Based on our investigation, setting the Internet zone security setting to **High** will protect users from the issue described in this advisory.

**How does configuring the Internet zone security setting to High protect me from this vulnerability?**

Setting the Internet zone security setting to **High** protects against this vulnerability by disabling scripting, disabling less secure features in Internet Explorer, and blocking known techniques used to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

**How does Protected Mode in Internet Explorer on Windows** **Vista** **and later Windows operating systems limit the impact of this vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer in Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems runs in [Protected Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/ie7-protected-mode.aspx) by default in the Internet security zone. (Protected Mode is off by default in the Intranet zone.) Protected Mode significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to write, alter, or destroy data on the userâs machine or to install malicious code. This is accomplished by using the integrity mechanisms of Windows Vista which restrict access to processes, files, and registry keys with higher integrity levels.

**What is Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)?**

Systems implementing Address Space Layout Randomization relocate normally-predictable function entry points pseudo-randomly in memory. Windows ASLR re-bases DLL or EXE into one of 256 random locations in memory. Therefore, attackers using hardcoded addresses are likely to "guess correctly" one in 256 times. For more information regarding ASLR, visit the TechNet magazine article, [Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part 3](https://technet.microsoft.com/magazine/2007.04.vistakernel.aspx?pr=blog).

**What is Data Execution Prevention (DEP)?**

Data Execution Prevention support is included in Internet Explorer, and although on by default for Internet Explorer 8, is off by default for earlier versions of Internet Explorer. DEP is designed to help foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable. For more information about DEP in Internet Explorer, please see the MSDN blog post, [IE8 Security Part I: DEP/NX Memory Protection](https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-i_3a00_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx).

**Can Data Execution Prevention (DEP) be bypassed in Internet Explorer 8?**

There is a report of a new Data Execution Prevention (DEP) exploit. We have analyzed the proof-of-concept exploit code and have found that Windows Vista and later versions of Windows offer more effective protections in blocking the exploit due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). On Windows XP, attackers could make the bypass techniques more reliable.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0247

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0247](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0247).

#### Mitigating Factors for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0247

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0247

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

Data Execution Prevention support is included in Internet Explorer, and although on by default for Internet Explorer 8, is off by default for earlier versions of Internet Explorer. DEP is designed to help foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable. For more information about DEP in Internet Explorer, please see the MSDN blog post, [IE8 Security Part I: DEP/NX Memory Protection](https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-i_3a00_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx).

**Can Data Execution Prevention (DEP) be bypassed in Internet Explorer 8?**

There is a report of a new Data Execution Prevention (DEP) exploit. We have analyzed the proof-of-concept exploit code and have found that Windows Vista and later versions of Windows offer more effective protections in blocking the exploit due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). On Windows XP, attackers could make the bypass techniques more reliable.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0249

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0249](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0249).

#### Mitigating Factors for HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0249

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Data Execution Protection (DEP) helps protect against attacks that result in code execution and is enabled by default in Internet Explorer 8 on the following Windows operating systems: Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista Service Pack 1, Windows Vista Service Pack 2, and Windows 7.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0249

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Enable DEP for Internet Explorer 6 or Internet Explorer 7**

  This vulnerability is more difficult to exploit successfully if Data Execution Protection (DEP) is enabled for Internet Explorer. You can enable DEP for all versions of Internet Explorer that support DEP, using one of the following methods:

  + **Enable DEP for Internet Explorer 7 interactively**

  Local Administrators can control DEP/NX by running Internet Explorer as an Administrator. To enable DEP, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click **Advanced**.
  2. Click **Enable memory protection to help mitigate online attacks**.
  3. Click **OK** and then restart Internet Explorer.
  + **Enable DEP for Internet Explorer 6 or Internet Explorer 7 using automated Microsoft Fix It**

    See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 978207](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/978207) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to **enable** or disable this workaround.

  **Impact of workaround.** Some browser extensions may not be compatible with DEP and may exit unexpectedly. If this occurs, you can disable the add-on, or revert the DEP setting using the Internet Control Panel. This is also accessible using the System Control panel.
* **Enable or disable ActiveX controls in Office 2007**

  To reduce the possibility of this vulnerability being exploited through an Office 2007 document using an ActiveX control, follow the steps below to disable ActiveX controls within Office documents. For more information about disabling ActiveX controls in Office 2007, see the Microsoft Office Online article, [Enable or disable ActiveX controls in Office documents](https://office.microsoft.com/help/ha100310671033.aspx).

  Open the Trust Center in Office 2007 applications using one of the following methods. Once you have selected the **ActiveX Settings**, select **Disable all controls without notification**, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you change an ActiveX control setting in one Office application, the settings are also changed in all the other Office programs on your computer.

  **Excel**

  Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Excel Options**, select **TrustCenter**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.

  From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.

  **Visio**

  From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.

  **Impact of workaround.** ActiveX controls will not be instantiated in Microsoft Office applications.
* **Do not open unexpected files**

  Do not open Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0249

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access incorrectly initialized memory under certain conditions, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**Which of the workarounds should I apply to my system in order to be protected?**

Based on our investigation, setting the Internet zone security setting to **High** will protect users from the issue described in this advisory.

**How does configuring the Internet zone security setting to High protect me from this vulnerability?**

Setting the Internet zone security setting to **High** protects against this vulnerability by disabling scripting, disabling less secure features in Internet Explorer, and blocking known techniques used to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

**How does Protected Mode in Internet Explorer on Windows** **Vista** **and later Windows operating systems limit the impact of this vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer in Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems runs in [Protected Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/ie7-protected-mode.aspx) by default in the Internet security zone. (Protected Mode is off by default in the Intranet zone.) Protected Mode significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to write, alter, or destroy data on the userâs machine or to install malicious code. This is accomplished by using the integrity mechanisms of Windows Vista which restrict access to processes, files, and registry keys with higher integrity levels.

**What is Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)?**

Systems implementing Address Space Layout Randomization relocate normally-predictable function entry points pseudo-randomly in memory. Windows ASLR re-bases DLL or EXE into one of 256 random locations in memory. Therefore, attackers using hardcoded addresses are likely to "guess correctly" one in 256 times. For more information regarding ASLR, visit the TechNet magazine article, [Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part 3](https://technet.microsoft.com/magazine/2007.04.vistakernel.aspx?pr=blog).

**What is Data Execution Prevention (DEP)?**

Data Execution Prevention support is included in Internet Explorer, and although on by default for Internet Explorer 8, is off by default for earlier versions of Internet Explorer. DEP is designed to help foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable. For more information about DEP in Internet Explorer, please see the MSDN blog post, [IE8 Security Part I: DEP/NX Memory Protection](https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-i_3a00_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx).

**Can Data Execution Prevention (DEP) be bypassed in Internet Explorer 8?**

There is a report of a new Data Execution Prevention (DEP) exploit. We have analyzed the proof-of-concept exploit code and have found that Windows Vista and later versions of Windows offer more effective protections in blocking the exploit due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). On Windows XP, attackers could make the bypass techniques more reliable.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2010-0249](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0249).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
