Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-0249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption issue in Microsoft Internet Explorer. It occurs when Internet Explorer accesses an HTML object that has been incorrectly initialized or has already been deleted. This results in an invalid pointer access, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness lies in how Internet Explorer manages objects in memory. It doesn't properly handle the lifecycle of HTML objects, leading to access of invalid memory locations.
- **Uninitialized/Deleted Object Access:** The vulnerability triggers when a specific code path in Internet Explorer attempts to access memory associated with an HTML object that is no longer valid (either not initialized correctly or already deallocated).
- **Invalid Pointer Reference:** The faulty object handling results in an invalid pointer reference, which is then used in subsequent operations, causing memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker can take complete control of the system, including installing software, modifying data, and creating new user accounts.
- **Denial of Service:** Exploitation could also lead to a denial-of-service condition by crashing the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted Web Pages:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into viewing a malicious web page that contains specially crafted HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Compromised Websites/Ad Networks:** Attackers can embed the malicious code on compromised or legitimate websites, or use advertising networks to deliver the exploit to vulnerable users.
- **Microsoft Office Documents:** In some cases, an attacker could also embed an ActiveX control in a malicious Microsoft Office document to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** An attacker does not need local access to the victim's machine. The attack is launched remotely by delivering a malicious web page through the network.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to view the malicious content, either by luring them to a website or by embedding the malicious content into some other mechanism such as an email or file.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the specific vulnerability and be able to craft exploit code to leverage the faulty object handling within Internet Explorer.
- **Ability to Serve Content:** The attacker needs a method to serve the malicious web page to the target users, such as a webserver.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was actively being exploited in the wild at the time of discovery, with publicly available exploit code.
- Microsoft released security bulletin MS10-002 to address this issue which was part of a larger cumulative update.
- Workarounds included enabling DEP for Internet Explorer and increasing security settings in Internet Explorer.
- Microsoft credited Google Inc., MANDIANT, Adobe, and McAfee for discovering this vulnerability.

This CVE is one of several memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in the MS10-002 bulletin. It's important to note that other CVEs (CVE-2010-0244, CVE-2010-0245, CVE-2010-0246, CVE-2010-0247, and CVE-2010-0248) share similar characteristics.
