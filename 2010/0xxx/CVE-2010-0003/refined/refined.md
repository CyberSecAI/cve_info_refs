Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `print_fatal_signal()` function within the Linux kernel, specifically on i386 architectures. When the `print-fatal-signals` option is enabled (which is disabled by default), the kernel dumps 16 bytes of memory at the address where a fatal signal is triggered. Because the address is controlled by user space, this allows a local user to force the kernel to dump any kernel memory to the log by making a jump to that address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Memory Access:** The kernel function does not validate if the provided address for dumping memory is in the user space or kernel space.
*   **Information Leak:** Allows reading of arbitrary memory reachable by the kernel when the print-fatal-signals option is enabled.
*   **Potential Denial of Service:** Can crash or slow down the system by jumping to an unmapped or invalid address and triggering multiple page faults, or cause issues with read side effects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leak:** A local user can potentially read sensitive kernel memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By causing a jump to an invalid memory address, the attacker could trigger a system crash or slowdown.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Controlled Address:** The attacker needs to control the address where the signal is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** A user account on the target machine.
*   **Ability to Trigger Fatal Signals:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger a signal that results in the `print_fatal_signal()` function to be invoked. The attacker has full control of the execution address used by the kernel function.
*   **`print-fatal-signals` option enabled:** This kernel option has to be enabled for the vulnerability to be triggered. This is disabled by default.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the i386 architecture.
*   The `print-fatal-signals` option, which is required for the vulnerability, is disabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and openSUSE systems (among others).
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the address is within the user space range, and to prevent further page faults if an invalid address is jumped to.
*   Some of the provided text is not directly relevant to the CVE. This includes detailed package lists and upgrade instructions for various systems which have been omitted.
* The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" on Red Hat systems
