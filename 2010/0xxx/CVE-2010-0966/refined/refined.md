      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the `basePath` parameter pointing to a remote file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL. The server must have the `allow_url_fopen` PHP configuration setting enabled for the RFI to work.",
       "additional_information": "The vulnerable code is located in `dzcp1.5.2/inc/config.php`. The vulnerability can be exploited by setting the `basePath` parameter of the URL request.
