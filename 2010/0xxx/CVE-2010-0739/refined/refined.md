  "CVE-2010-0739": {
    "Description": "Integer overflow in TeX Live's processing of special commands in DVI files, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when processing special commands within DVI files.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow (CWE-189)",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, user-assisted attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable program.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted DVI files. An attacker would need to trick a user into processing such a file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must create a specially crafted DVI file and convince a user to process it. No special privileges are required other than user interaction."
