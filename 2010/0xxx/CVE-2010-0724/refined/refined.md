Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2010-0724:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Software:** Arab Cart Version 1.0.2.0
*   **Root Cause:** The `showimg.php` script is vulnerable to multiple flaws due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `id` parameter in `showimg.php` is vulnerable to XSS.
    2.  **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in `showimg.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    3.  **Blind SQL/XPath Injection:** The `id` parameter in `showimg.php` is also vulnerable to blind SQL/XPath injection techniques.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate database queries to gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or potentially gain control over the database server.
    *   **Blind SQL/XPath Injection:**  An attacker can extract sensitive data by exploiting boolean conditions in the SQL queries, although it is slower than regular SQL injection.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET requests** to the `showimg.php` script with malicious payloads in the `id` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Arab Cart application.

**Exploit Examples:**

1.  **XSS:**
