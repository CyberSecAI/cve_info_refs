Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2010-0542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `_WriteProlog()` function within the `texttops` image filter of CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System). This occurs because the return value from the `calloc()` function is not checked, which may result in the use of an invalid NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unchecked Memory Allocation:** The code fails to check the return value of `calloc()` leading to a potential NULL pointer.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Dereferencing the unchecked return value from calloc() causes a NULL pointer dereference, which causes the program to crash. The offset from this pointer is user-controlled which may allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most direct impact of the vulnerability is a crash of the application due to the NULL pointer dereference.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Because the offset from the NULL pointer is controlled by the user, there's a potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted print job through the texttops filter, exploiting the unchecked return of calloc().

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a specially crafted print job that gets processed by the vulnerable `texttops` filter. This could be a local user or a remote user if the CUPS service is exposed.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to pass data that controls the offset from the pointer.

**Additional Details**
- A patch was created and shared by Apple, the issue was acknowledged to be first reported by regenrecht.
- The vulnerability was fixed in CUPS version 1.4.4.
- Red Hat issued RHSA-2010:0490 to address this issue in their Enterprise Linux products.
- Fedora also released updates to address the issue in versions 11, 12 and 13
- Debian also issued a security advisory (DSA-2176-1) to address this vulnerability, along with other CUPS related vulnerabilities.
- Gentoo issued a GLSA (201207-10) for the vulnerability with details for affected packages, and references to CVE-2010-0542.
