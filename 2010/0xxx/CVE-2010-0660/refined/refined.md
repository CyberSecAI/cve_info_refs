*    **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a webpage or some means to make an XMLHttpRequest.

**Vulnerability 5:**

*   **Issue ID:** 23693
*  **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** Escape more characters in shortcuts.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided information does not specify the root cause, but indicates that shortcuts were not properly escaping certain characters.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Inadequate sanitization of characters used in shortcut handling, possibly leading to injection attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious content via browser shortcuts.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could use malicious crafted shortcuts to exploit this.
*    **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to somehow get the victim to use a shortcut that is not properly escaped.

**Vulnerability 6:**

*   **Issue IDs:** 8864, 24701, 24646
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Description:** Renderer memory errors drawing on canvases.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided information does not specify the root cause but indicates a memory error related to rendering canvases.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Errors in memory management during canvas rendering.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** This could lead to browser crashes or arbitrary code execution within the renderer.
*   **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted web page with malicious canvas operations can trigger the issue.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to render a webpage with the canvas element to exploit this vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 7:**

*   **Issue ID:** 28566
*   **Severity:** High
*  **Description:** Image decoding memory error.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption during image decoding process.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Could lead to browser crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** A crafted image file could trigger this vulnerability during the decoding process when opened by the browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to get a crafted image to be decoded by the vulnerable browser.

**Vulnerability 8:**

*   **Issue ID:** 29920
*   **Severity:** Low
*   **Description:** Corner case failure to strip Referer.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided information does not specify the root cause, but indicates an issue where the referrer header was not being stripped properly.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Referrer header could expose sensitive information.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**  Potential for leaking sensitive information via the referer header
*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious site could redirect a user to another site without properly stripping the referrer header, exposing information about the previous website.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need a way to redirect users in a manner that would cause the improper referer to be sent.

**Vulnerability 9:**
*  **Issue ID:** 30660
*  **Severity:** High
