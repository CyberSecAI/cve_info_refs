| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86\_64; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.9) Gecko/20100330 Fedora/3.5.9-2.fc12 Firefox/3.5.9
Build Identifier: 3.6
localconfig is set as world readable (0644) by checksetup.pl's "fixing permissions" section if $suexec is enabled.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Extract bugzilla 3.6
2. Run ./checksetup.pl to generate localconfig
3. Edit localconfig setting suexec=1 (and other necessary details)
4. Run ./checksetup.pl again
Actual Results:
$ ls -l localconfig
-rw-r--r-- 1 bugzilla bugzilla 5638 2010-04-26 03:33 localconfig
Expected Results:
$ ls -l localconfig
-rw-r----- 1 bugzilla bugzilla 5638 2010-04-26 03:33 localconfig
Although the webserver is stopped from serving localconfig via .htaccess (if $create\_htaccess = 1) this will not stop other users with shell access gaining the database password.

The only files that need to be readable by the webserver are the files that are directly served by the webserver (i.e. html, css, javascript, etc). Files which are only data files for the CGI scripts only need to be readable by the CGI scripts (thus the bugzilla user in this case)
There appears not to be any mechanism for this situation in Bugzilla/Install/Filesystem.pm ... localconfig must be group readable to the webservergroup when not using suexec or the webserver can't read it at all. Sounds like we need an additional category to put files into which are considered non-served data files.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

Attached patch

[v1 (bundle)](attachment.cgi?id=441701&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=441701&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=561797&attachment=441701)

Okay, I decided to overhaul the permissions system in general. This was the only reasonable way that I could get secure suexec permissions on all files and still get everything working. You'll notice that this patch contains a \*lot\* of changes--I don't think I can split them out and still get a secure system under both suexec and non-suexec.
Note that I don't care that much about the security of installations that don't specify a $webservergroup, so they will still be relatively insecure.
Here's a list of some important changes:
\* All the permission types are now constants, so they can be accessed from
outside of Filesystem.pm, and because they really should be constants anyway.
\* I added a bunch of new permission types, to differentiate between files
that the webserver serves, and files that cgi scripts read or write to.
\* I added a constant DIR\_ALSO\_WS\_SERVE, which can be OR'ed into any
directory permission type to indicate that cgis write to that directory
but then its contents are directly served to the user. I did this instead
of adding a new constant, because I would have had to add two new constants
that would have been hard to name, and probably confusing. This is pretty
readable.
\* Before this patch, the "web" directory in extensions probably wasn't working
under suexec. This patch makes the "web" directory an official part of
extensions and makes Filesystem.pm correctly set permissions on it. It also
sets permissions on the rest of the extension much more tightly.
\* The default permission of files in the Bugzilla root directory is now
OWNER\_READ instead of the former $ws\_readable. This should be a more secure
default--now we have to explicitly specify any file that we want the webserver
to be able to read, in the root dir.
\* I fixed the suexec problems with dependency graphs. Once those permissions
were fixed, I noticed that files in data/webdot were world-readable, so
I added some code to fix their permissions properly while
showdependencygraph runs, and delete the png file briefly after the script
finishes. (And always delete the .map and .dot files, because we don't need
those once the cgi is done.)
\* Old Charts are also world-readable under suexec, but I think those are
basically public information anyway, so I'm not so concerned about it.
Also, it would be much more complicated to delete them after a period
of time, because they have fixed names (they aren't regenerated on
every hit).
\* I added permission-setting for the .bzr dir. I've made it OWNER\_WRITEABLE.
It's hard to say whether or not somebody would put anything secure in there,
but it's always possible that their bzr history is private.Assignee: installation → mkanatStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Oh, actually, I realized that I could simply make ALSO\_WS\_SERVE into 00001 and then people couldn't list the data/webdot directory, but the webserver could still serve files from it, because we always know the names of the files we're serving. So this eliminated the need for the unlinking in showdependencygraph.cgi (it's unlikely anybody's going to guess the names of our temp files).

ok, at first glance most of this looks good to me. I have a couple issues with the showdependencygraph stuff though.
In %create\_dirs:
+ $webdotdir => DIR\_CGI\_WRITE,
That should be | DIR\_ALSO\_WS\_SERVE, right?
The "wait 5 seconds before exiting" thing sounds hoaky to me. Some user-agents might wait for the connection to close downloading the initial page before they start loading images, which would make it moot. Pretty sure the major browsers aren't among those, but still... don't we already have a cleanup for this directory somewhere? (cleans stuff over a certain age?). If this is a concern, we should make the time shorter on that instead of doing it here.
If we do leave the unlink here, the .map file is served to the user-agent, so you need to use $unlink\_png on the UNLINK for that one, also, otherwise it won't be there when the user-agent comes back for it. It also needs to have WS\_SERVE permissions, regardless whether we unlink it or not when we're done.

So if I understand correctly, this leak is new in Bugzilla 3.6 and is due to [bug 123165](/show_bug.cgi?id=123165 "RESOLVED FIXED - Permissions setup option for bugzilla_user==webserver_user (suexec)")?

Assuming [bug 123165](/show_bug.cgi?id=123165 "RESOLVED FIXED - Permissions setup option for bugzilla_user==webserver_user (suexec)") is indeed the culprit, Bugzilla 3.5.1 and newer are affected.Summary: checksetup.pl with $suexec=1 sets localconfig as world readable (suexec permissions have several problems) → [SECURITY] checksetup.pl with $suexec=1 sets localconfig as world readable (suexec permissions have several problems)Version: unspecified → 3.5.1

Okay, so we have somewhat of a dilemma here: this is kind of a huge refactoring that's somewhat hard to test. I've tested it fairly thoroughly, but when you mess with permissions, it's hard to say what's going to break on people's installs.
We have a few options:
1. Don't fix this in the 3.6 branch, and just warn people about it. This would still give 3.6 suexec support than 3.4 and earlier had.
2. Check this in on trunk only, let it "bake" for a while, and if things are OK, then backport it to a later 3.6 release.
3. Check this in to the 3.6 branch and risk breakage.
4. Do a backport that only fixes the localconfig issue. I think that this might be silly, because there are probably lots of other important files that should also be protected. But it's a possibility.
I'm most in favor of #1 or #4.

I'm in favor of #4 too. That's the single critical file which contains passwords and other sensitive data (I think data/params is already correctly protected, right?).

v4 (bundle)
OK, this patch breaks installations using the PROJECT environment variable. I have two localconfig files in the same bugzilla/ directory: the default one named localconfig, and the one used by PROJECT=foo named localconfig.foo. When running checksetup.pl, it sets permissions to 640 for the localconfig file corresponding to the PROJECT env variable, setting the other one to 400, making it unreadable by the web server, and so breaking all other installations.

```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Everybody could search for time-tracking information, not just
  members of the timetrackinggroup.

* Under suexec, "localconfig" was world-readable, meaning that
  local users with shell access to the Bugzilla server may have
  been able to see the database password and the site_wide_secret.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Remote Information Disclosure
Affected:    2.17.1 to 3.2.6, 3.3.1 to 3.4.6, 3.5.1 to 3.6, 3.7
Fixed In:    3.2.7, 3.4.7, 3.6.1, 3.7.1
Description: Normally, information about time-tracking (estimated
             hours, actual hours, hours worked, and deadlines) is
             restricted to users in the "time-tracking group".
             However, any user was able, by crafting their own
             search URL, to search for bugs based using those
             fields as criteria, thus possibly exposing sensitive
             time-tracking information by a user seeing that a bug
             matched their search.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309952
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-1204

Class:       Local Information Disclosure
Affected:    3.5.1 to 3.6, 3.7
Fixed In:    3.6.1, 3.7.1
Description: If $use_suexec was set to "1" in the localconfig file,
             then the localconfig file's permissions were set as
             world-readable by checksetup.pl. This allowed any user
             with local shell access to see the contents of the file,
             including the database password and the site_wide_secret
             variable used for CSRF protection.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=561797
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-0180

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
