Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in `video_show.php`, `spotlight_detail.php`, `real_estate_details.php`, and `auto_details.php`. These vulnerabilities are triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** A remote file inclusion vulnerability is present in `external.php`, triggered by manipulating the `url` parameter.

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `url` parameter, allowing inclusion of remote files.

**Impact:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive database information, modify or delete data, or even gain control of the database server itself.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious script. This could lead to full server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious SQL queries within the `id` parameter of the specified PHP files.
*   **Remote File Inclusion:** By providing a URL pointing to a malicious script within the `url` parameter of the `external.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No authentication is specifically mentioned, so it is likely that these vulnerabilities can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit information includes example URLs, making it easier to reproduce the vulnerabilities.
*   The content also includes references to other CVEs (CVE-2010-0974), which might indicate other related vulnerabilities in the same application.
