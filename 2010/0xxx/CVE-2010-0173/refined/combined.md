How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached patch

[handle failure from NPP\_New for NP\_FULL](attachment.cgi?id=376087&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=376087&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=491722&attachment=376087)

note that the web page will be empty (this is partially to fix the crash).
While it might be nice to navigate back to a previous page, i'm unwilling to do that to fix this crash. There's the potential for an infinite loop:
1. user loads page <x>
1' @page <x>
2. page <x> redirects to application/vnd.plugin.type
3. plugin returns failure code
4. plugindocument navigates back to previous page
5. browser reloads page <x>
=> go to 1'
I'd likeAssignee: nobody → timelessStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

handle failure from NPP\_New for NP\_FULL
I'm fine with the "modules/plugin" part of this patch but I don't thing I'm a good reviewer for the rest, which is the bulk of it.
Passing review to roc, get sr from jst.

Note that timeless almost never looks at a bug again after he attaches a patch, so if you mean that in a way other than "has been automatically placed on" you'll probably want to treat finding someone other than him to retriage it and rewrite the patch as a priority.

This would be fixed by taking the fix for [bug 533030](/show_bug.cgi?id=533030 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsPluginHost::TrySetUpPluginInstance() can return with the plugin instance owner holding a non initialized instance.") for 1.9.2. This already fixed on trunk.

This sg:critical bug is fixable by taking the trivial fix for [bug 533030](/show_bug.cgi?id=533030 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsPluginHost::TrySetUpPluginInstance() can return with the plugin instance owner holding a non initialized instance."), so I
think we should take this on the 1.9.2 branch.
Also, since the fix for [bug 533030](/show_bug.cgi?id=533030 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsPluginHost::TrySetUpPluginInstance() can return with the plugin instance owner holding a non initialized instance.") already landed on trunk, I'm marking this
bug fixed.

beltzner, the fix for this is to take the fix for [bug 533030](/show_bug.cgi?id=533030 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsPluginHost::TrySetUpPluginInstance() can return with the plugin instance owner holding a non initialized instance.") (which is already fixed for 1.9.2), per above comments.

What is the best way to test this? I don't see an automated test in either this or [bug 533030](/show_bug.cgi?id=533030 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsPluginHost::TrySetUpPluginInstance() can return with the plugin instance owner holding a non initialized instance.").

I don't really have any good suggestions beyond [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=491722#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsObjectFrame doesn't properly handle NPP_New failing for NP_FULL [@libgobject-2.0.so.0.2000.1@0x29302 ]").
Testing needs a plugin that fails NPP\_New.
This used to be caused by [bug 510963](/show_bug.cgi?id=510963 "RESOLVED FIXED - getting NPNVPluginElementNPObject fails"), which won't affect 1.9.1.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=499862&attachment=428646)

We need to flush out break sinks etc even if there are no mapped flows. In this testcase, the textrun finishes after the T (since it's in a float by itself) so we exit too early from FlushFrames. Flushing out the break sinks is needed so that we tell the text-transform textrun where the capitalized characters are.

I'm fine to leave these unfixed, yeah. It does mean we can't open up this bug for a while longer, though.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache2-mod\_php5/php5
Incomplete XML RPC requests could crash the php interpreter (CVE-2010-0397).
PHP was updated to version 5.2.12 to fix the problem.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.2
- bytefx-data-mysql
Mono's ASP.NET implementation did not set the 'EnableViewStateMac'
property by default. Attackers could exploit that to conduct
cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks.
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- flash-player
This update fixes multiple critical security vulnerabilities which allow
an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code or to cause a denial of
service. The following CVE numbers have been assigned:
CVE-2008-4546, CVE-2009-3793, CVE-2010-1297, CVE-2010-2160,
CVE-2010-2161, CVE-2010-2162, CVE-2010-2163, CVE-2010-2164,

CVE-2010-2186, CVE-2010-2187, CVE-2010-2188, CVE-2010-2189
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0-11.2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1
- fuse
A race condition in fusermount allows non-privileged

The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.

This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Paul Stone discovered that Firefox could be made to change a mouse click

into a drag and drop event. If the user could be tricked into performing

this action twice on a crafted website, an attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2010-0178](/security/CVE-2010-0178))

It was discovered that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module as used by the Firebug

add-on could be used to escalate privileges within the browser. If the user

had the Firebug add-on installed and were tricked into viewing a malicious

website, an attacker could potentially run arbitrary JavaScript.

([CVE-2010-0179](/security/CVE-2010-0179))

Henry Sudhof discovered that an image tag could be used as a redirect to

a mailto: URL to launch an external mail handler. ([CVE-2010-0181](/security/CVE-2010-0181))

Wladimir Palant discovered that Firefox did not always perform security

checks on XML content. An attacker could exploit this to bypass security

policies to load certain resources. ([CVE-2010-0182](/security/CVE-2010-0182))

###!!! ASSERTION: Incorrect aState.mPrevChild before inserting line at end: 'aState.mPrevChild == mFrames.LastChild()', file /Users/jruderman/mozilla-central/layout/generic/nsBlockFrame.cpp, line 2162
bz marked a previous bug with this assertion as security-sensitive ([bug 522170](/show_bug.cgi?id=522170 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: Incorrect aState.mPrevChild before inserting line at end\" with -moz-column, float, huge min-height")), so I'm filing this one as security-sensitive.

On trunk this assertion shouldn't itself lead to a security problem. On 3.6 and earlier it is likely to cause a messed up frame tree, so a security problem is likely just around the corner.

|  | [Timothy Nikkel (:tnikkel)](/user_profile?user_id=255010)  Assignee |  |

| [Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=542136#c2)• 15 years ago |
|  | |

So I think the problem lies with this bit of code in nsBlockFrame::ReflowInlineFrame <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/generic/nsBlockFrame.cpp#3838>
// If we just ended a first-letter frame or reflowed a placeholder then
// don't split the line and don't stop the line reflow...
if (!(frameReflowStatus & NS\_INLINE\_BREAK\_FIRST\_LETTER\_COMPLETE) &&
nsGkAtoms::placeholderFrame != frameType) {
// Split line after the current frame
\*aLineReflowStatus = LINE\_REFLOW\_STOP;
rv = SplitLine(aState, aLineLayout, aLine, aFrame->GetNextSibling(), aLineReflowStatus);
NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
}
At this point \*aLineReflowStatus is already LINE\_REFLOW\_STOP because the reflow status was break after for the frame we just reflowed, but we don't split the line because of the first letter complete check. And so we stop reflow after 1 of 2 frames on the line and when we get back to nsBlockFrame::ReflowDirtyLines mPrevChild is not the last frame on the line. Adding "|| \*aLineReflowStatus == LINE\_REFLOW\_STOP" to the if condition fixes the asserts for me.

I notice with the testcase post-fix that I'm not seeing the assert above anymore on OS X but I do get:
###!!! ASSERTION: overflow list w/o frames: 'mFrames.NotEmpty()', file /Users/albill/mozilla-192/layout/generic/nsInlineFrame.cpp, line 374
Is this a non-issue?

I don't get that assertion on trunk, I would guess because of [bug 533379](/show_bug.cgi?id=533379 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: overflow list w/o frames\" or \"ABORT: running past end\" with -moz-column, list-style-position") which is fixed on trunk but not 1.9.2.

Well, that isn't \*this\* assertion so I will call this verified1.9.2.Keywords: [verified1.9.2](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.9.2&resolution=---)

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-16

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.2.2/ 1.9.1.9/ 1.9.0.19)

Announced
March 30, 2010

Mozilla developers and community
Impact

Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.19
* Firefox 3.5.9
* Firefox 3.6.2
* SeaMonkey 2.0.4
* Thunderbird 3.0.4

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in
the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References

Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in
the browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6.

Null deref [@ nsTextControlFrame::CalcIntrinsicSize]

| [Comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=496011#c1)• 15 years ago |
|  | |

The nsTextControlFrame has no mFirstChild.
And the reason for that is that for some reason those execCommand's end up operating on the kids of the textarea. In particular, the insertHTML calls actually mess with the anonymous DOM inside the textarea, so that after the insertHTML call the frame tree actually has the ib split for that span-containing-a-div inside the textarea's anonymous block. Then undo removes the ib split, which tries to recreate the anonymous block, which fails but leaves the textarea in a bad state.
We could at the very least reconstruct the textarea when we go to reconstruct that anonymous block. roc, I think we've talked about that sort of thing before; do you recall why we didn't do it?
But apart from that, why is the HTML editor on the <body> messing with the anonymous internal DOM in the textarea?Group: core-security

In the case I was looking at, reconstruction of the anonymous block was being triggered by the initialization of the textarea frame itself. So propagating that reconstruction up to the textarea would have triggered an infinite loop.

Ah, ok. But we fixed that, right? Given that, is this a reasonable thing to try?
I still think we need to fix the editor bug here, though.

patch to make the frame constructor deal with recreating frames for native anonymous content
I don't think this is the right thing to do. In particular, this can easily confuse things like video controls, I think...
A better solution, maybe, would be to have MaybeRecreateContainerForFrameRemoval recreate the parent if the frame's content is the root of a native anonymous subtree. We could do that in RecreateFramesForContent instead, but doing it in MaybeRecreateContainerForFrameRemoval should cover the case of someone calling ContentRemoved directly to, right? I \_think\_ we want to reconstruct the ancestor in that case....

Because in general, the parent expects its native anon content to be around (as here) and if that frame is gone the parent will be \_very\_ confused.

Yeah ok, I was thinking that the only thing that would try to do ContentRemoved on the root of a native anonymous subtree would be the owner frame, so that the owner gets rid of its native anonymous content purposefully for some reason, and then we reconstruct the owner and it creates the native anonymous content again.

Or there any other cases where we might try to reconstruct a child of a leaf frame (the reason the reconstruct fails in this testcase)? Might we want to do something similar for children of leaf frames at some point?

Verified fixed for 1.9.2 using testcase with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2pre) Gecko/20100312 Namoroka/3.6.2pre. 1.9.2.0 crashes with the testcase.
I can't verify this with the testcase for 1.9.1 because 1.9.1.8 doesn't crash with the attached testcase. Has anyone seen this crash on 1.9.1 or have suggestions for reproducing the crash? I tried both debug and retail builds.Keywords: [verified1.9.2](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.9.2&resolution=---)

(In reply to [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=496011#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextControlFrame::CalcIntrinsicSize] with execCommand inserthtml {ib} and undo"))

What is the expected thing to happen here? Reading the code, as far as I can tell, the inserthtml command first deletes the selection if it's not collapsed. Doing so in this case will boil down to a bunch of RemoveChild calls on the body element. The RemoveChild on the textarea should also lead to the span element being removed, right? And it should also remove textarea's native anonymous subtree. I'm kind of confused on what's happening here out of ordinary.
BTW, I'm not sure what ib splits are, so that might explain why I don't understand the issue hre.

The ib-split is the <span><div></div></span>. An ib-split is any inline element that contains a block element. The block ends up splitting the inline.

Thanks for the explanation. But that still doesn't help me understand [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=496011#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextControlFrame::CalcIntrinsicSize] with execCommand inserthtml {ib} and undo") completely.

Ehsan, what happens here is that the insertHTML call inserts the <span><div/></span> gunk into the anonymous content subtree inside the textarea (presumably because that's where the selection is positioned?). The fact that this happens seems like a bug in insertHTML to me.

On Mac trunk this is a null deref crash. Different code path than Windows, or has trunk just changed since this bug was filed?

Hmmm... just assigning bugs to me doesn't work if I don't see the bugmail (which I often don't).
In any case, I can reproduce the crash (although it's a different stack), but it doesn't crash under valgrind.

To answer the question: not really, but I'm not sure who's more appropriate.
In any case, this looks like a null dereference in both of Martijn's stacks (I actually see the latter one on trunk now; the first one might have been something that was on trunk for a bit and then fixed), so I'm not sure why it's security-sensitive.
It's also pretty timing sensitive and thus hard to debug. But it seems like the problem is that the pres context in question has gotten its SetShell(null) call, so the mShell that we try to dereference is null.

shell->NotifyDestroyingFrame(this);
In an opt build it may be a null in this testcase, but that doesn't mean a different testcase couldn't get a more useful value there.
In 3.5.6pre I'm getting a slightly different stack than in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=488850#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsRootBoxFrame::RemoveFrame][@ nsFrame::Destroy][@@0x0 | nsFrameList::DestroyFrames()] with popup, menuitem and body onload removing window") but like [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=488850#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsRootBoxFrame::RemoveFrame][@ nsFrame::Destroy][@@0x0 | nsFrameList::DestroyFrames()] with popup, menuitem and body onload removing window") its still trying to execute 0x0 which is scarier than merely dereferencing it.

The menuitem in crash1.xul with an image gets an nsImageBoxFrame, it sets up a nsImageBoxFrameEvent to run when it is loaded that dispatches the load event. This calls the onload handler for the popup, we get a ContentRemoved on the root element and we start destroying frames. We get to nsImageBoxFrame::Destroy, which calls CancelAndForgetObserver on its imgImageRequest, this is the last thing blocking the load of the document, so it triggers the document's onload handler. So we remove the subdocument frame from the parent document and this nulls out the presshell on the subdocument's prescontext. When we get back to nsImageBoxFrame::Destroy it eventually calls nsFrame::Destroy where our presshell is null.

Clearly something between nsImageBoxFrame and the triggering of onload should be asynchronous so onload doesn't fire during frame destruction.

Changing the CancelAndForgetObserver call in nsImageBoxFrame::Destroy to a Cancel call and moving the nulling out of the frame of mListener to before the Cancel call would seem like the right way to fix this. Or am I missing something?
Potentially every other call of CancelAndForgetObserver could have this same problem.

Sounds good to me. I don't think that nulling out needs to be moved, though.
> Potentially every other call of CancelAndForgetObserver could have this same

Maybe. I'm not sure why CancelAndForgetObserver would want to cancel synchronously, but then I don't know this code at all.

The nulling out of the frame is because I think we can still get notifications sent to the listener object.

If it's asynchronous then we don't need to move the nulling out, it's fine for it to be where it is after the Cancel() call.

I guess you're right if we don't have to worry about synchronous notifications.

> Or am I missing something?
I think you are, and the something is that imagelib holds a raw pointer weak ref to mListener, which means that once nsImageBoxFrame::~nsImageBoxFrame happens it'll be holding a pointer to a dead object and then will proceed to asynchronously call virtual methods on it... We should really just fix that with some cycle collection smarts in imagelib, imho.
But given that, you really do need to CancelAndForgetObserver(). The fact that this ends up synchronously removing from the loadgroup is really bad; it needs to be guaranteeing that doesn't happen. Joe, Bobby, can we fix that?

Sorry I somehow missed this before.
As you proved, we \*can\* fix it. We have the technology. My question is: why should removing from the load group be asynchronous when everything else in that method is synchronous, by design?
More broadly stated: how in the world can we get this \*right\*, aside from hooking imagelib up to the cycle collector?

The main thing that needs to be synchronous is setting the observer to null (since it's about to die). The rest of the synchronicity is due to not wanting to break imagelib api, and therefore needing to deliver notifications before nulling out the observer. A key part here is that the observer is what receives these notifications and thus has control over how they're handled.
The loadgroup removal is NOT part of the imagelib API; it's part of the necko API. And necko defines that Cancel() on an nsIRequest is asynchronous. More importantly, though, the loadgroup removal can trigger arbitrary code to run that is not under the control of the observer, while we know for a fact that use of the CancelAndForgetObserver API means the observer is not in a good state (in the middle of a destructor, for one thing!).
> More broadly stated: how in the world can we get this \*right\*,
Hooking up to cycle collection is one approach, as you say. The other approach, which I think might be even better, is switching imagelib to an API more similar to Necko's, where the image would not keep a pointer to its observer for longer than absolutely necessary. In particular, if animations were pulled by consumers, not pushed by imagelib, we would not need long-term references to observers. All this modulo multipart jpegs, which we would need to do something with, of course, since right now they're exposed in imagelib API as multiple separate image loads, not as animations, right?

OK, I totally buy this!

This is probably possible. Because images don't change size, no reflow would be necessary; nsRefreshDriver could tell layout to redraw, and then layout could just get imagelib to draw the current frame.

Right. Which is a bit silly, but before nsRefreshDriver there was really no way to force redraws, I guess.

Vlad, if you can't review this before Sunday, just switch the review request to roc - he can do it on Monday, aka North America's Sunday. :)

This doesn't need to be fixed in 1.9.0.19 unless it's also fixed in 1.9.1.9. Since it hasn't landed on trunk yet, that's unlikely, so no longer blocking for 1.9.0.19.Flags: blocking1.9.0.19+ → blocking1.9.0.19-

Gah. The only reason this hasn't landed on trunk yet is because I was waiting on vlad's review and of course I got no notification that it had happened... I'm landing it on trunk right now.

That said, on 1.9.0 this looks like it needs a totally different fix, since CancelAndForgetRequest doesn't exist there. Joe?

I'm going to call this status1.9.0-wontfix, because fixing it will introduce more risk than not fixing it (since it would involve backporting all the Cancel\*() fixes that bz and I have cooked up over the past two years).
