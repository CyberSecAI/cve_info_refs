Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2010-0173:

**CVE-2010-0173**

*   **Root Cause:** This CVE is associated with several stability bugs found in the browser engine of Mozilla Firefox and other Mozilla-based products (like SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Xulrunner). These bugs could lead to crashes and memory corruption. Specifically, it is related to issues where a plugin fails to properly instantiate, leading to a crash during window resizing due to incorrect handling of the failure in `nsObjectFrame` when `NPP_New` returns an error.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  Improper error handling in plugin instantiation, leading to a crash. A failure of the `NPP_New` function in a plugin was not correctly handled, resulting in a null pointer dereference.  Incorrect management of the `mPrevChild` state during line insertion in `nsBlockFrame` could also lead to crashes and memory corruption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker could cause a DoS by tricking a user into viewing a malicious website.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** There is a possibility that a remote attacker could exploit the identified memory corruption to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Websites:** Attackers could create malicious websites that exploit these vulnerabilities when a user visits them.
    *   **Malicious Plugins:** Exploiting plugins which fail to instantiate correctly in NP_FULL mode by returning an error from `NPP_New`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote:**  An attacker needs to host a malicious website or craft a malicious plugin that a user can be tricked into using to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   **User Interaction:** User needs to visit the attacker controlled web page or load a vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details from Bugzilla entries:**

*   **Bug 491722** shows the crash occurs in `gtk_xtbin_new` due to `parent_window` being null, which stems from the plugin returning an error from `NPP_New` in `NP_FULL` mode and the calling code not properly handling that error condition. The fix for this is actually handled by the fix for Bug 533030.
*   **Bug 499862** relates to "ASSERTION: invalid array index" in `nsTextFrameThebes.cpp`, `nsLineBreaker.cpp` and `gfxFont.cpp`, caused by a combination of CSS properties `overflow:scroll`, `float:left`, `text-transform` and dynamically changing styles which triggers incorrect break sink handling.
*   **Bug 542136** relates to "ASSERTION: Incorrect aState.mPrevChild before inserting line at end" due to a faulty state check during line splitting of inline frames in nsBlockFrame, and can lead to a crash.
*   **Bug 496011** is a crash in `nsTextControlFrame::CalcIntrinsicSize` caused by how `execCommand inserthtml {ib}` and `undo` interacts with the anonymous DOM inside a textarea element, specifically involving spans and divs leading to null dereferences.
*  **Bug 488850** shows a crash related to how `nsImageBoxFrame` handles load events with the use of `CancelAndForgetObserver` leading to a null deref. The test case involves a menuitem in a popup and body onload event removing the window. This was due to the observer of the image loading being a raw pointer.

The provided content also highlights that the fixes for these vulnerabilities were included in Firefox 3.5.9, and Xulrunner version 1.9.1.9.

It's also noted that the vulnerability is considered security sensitive due to the potential for remote code execution.
