{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple bugs in the implementation of HTTP Digest Authentication in Geo++(R) GNCASTER.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The server accepts HTTP Basic Authentication even when HTTP Digest is required.",
      "The server generates the nonce used for HTTP Digest authentication only once when the server is started, making it vulnerable to replay attacks.",
      "The server's response to a failed authentication request includes 32 bytes of memory data, potentially revealing sensitive information like other users' HTTP requests and authentication headers."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can replay recorded authentication information to gain access to the admin interface. They may also gather other user's authentication headers from disclosed memory portions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network eavesdropping to record a user's login communication.",
       "Sending crafted HTTP requests to retrieve memory content by changing the length of header fields."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between a user and the Geo++(R) GNCASTER server or be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the server."
