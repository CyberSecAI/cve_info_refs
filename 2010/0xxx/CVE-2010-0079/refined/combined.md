### Overview

Oracle products and components are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpujan2010.html) addresses 24 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components. The document provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. If significant additional details about vulnerabilities and remediation techniques become available, we will update the [Vulnerability Notes Database](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpujan2010.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2010

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2010

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. It also includes non-security fixes that are required (because of interdependencies) by those security patches. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative, except as noted below, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 24 new security fixes across all products.

### Supported Products and Components Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in [square brackets] following the product versions.

### Patch Availability Table and Risk Matrices

#### Products with Cumulative Patches

Note to EBusiness Suite Customers: This CPU announces new cumulative patches for Oracle E-Business Suite Release 11i10 CU2 customers. For more information, please see [Oracle E-Business Suite Critical Patch Update Note](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=75498992131972&id=985520.1) for January 2010.

The Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control, Oracle E-Business Suite Applications (Releases 11i10 CU2, 12.0 and 12.1), JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, JD Edwards OneWorld Tools, PeopleSoft Enterprise Portal Applications, PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools and Siebel Enterprise, Oracle Industry Applications and BEA patches in the Updates are cumulative; patches for any of these products included in a Critical Patch Update will include all fixes for that product from the previous Critical Patch Updates.

#### Products with Non-Cumulative Patches

Oracle E-Business Suite Applications Release 11.5.10 patches are not cumulative, so Oracle E-Business Suite Applications customers should refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to identify previous security fixes they want to apply. Oracle Collaboration Suite patches were cumulative up to and including the fixes provided in the July 2007 Critical Patch Update. From the July 2007 Critical Patch Update on, Oracle Collaboration Suite security fixes are delivered using the one-off patch infrastructure normally used by Oracle to deliver single bug fixes to customers.

For each administered Oracle product, consult the documentation for patch availability information and installation instructions referenced from the following table. For an overview of the Oracle product documentation related to this Critical Patch Update, please refer to the Oracle Critical Patch Update January 2010 Documentation Map, [My Oracle Support Note 974531.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=74954350670827&id=974531.1).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous](/security-alerts/) Critical Patch Update advisories.

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

#### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

#### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) Critical Patch Update advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. Hence Oracle recommends that customers upgrade their Oracle products to a supported version.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase. Critical Patch Update patches may not be downloaded to update products supported with Sustaining Support, or to update any unsupported products.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/Dashboard). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### *On Request* Model for Oracle Database and Oracle Application Server

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. We create patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database and Oracle Application Server only if requested by customers.

Additional details regarding the products, versions and platforms that will be supported for the next Critical Patch Update and the process for requesting On Request patches are available in the *Critical Patch Update January 2010 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products* ( [My Oracle Support Note 967472.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=75433325417319&id=967472.1)).

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations discovered and brought security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle's attention: Anonymous Researcher of TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Esteban Martinez Fayo of Application Security, Inc.; Alexander Kornbrust of Red Database Security; David Litchfield of NGS Software; Brian Martin of INS.com; Guy Pilosof of Sentrigo; JPCERT/CC Vulnerability Handling Team; Daiki Fukumori [Secure Sky Technology] of JPCERT/CC Vulnerability Handling Team; and Dennis Yurichev.

#### Security-In-Depth Contributors

Oracle provides recognition to people that have contributed to our Security-In-Depth program (see [FAQ](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html)). People are recognized for Security-In-Depth contributions if they provide information, observations or suggestions pertaining to security vulnerability issues that result in significant modification of Oracle code or documentation in future releases, but are not of such a critical nature that they are distributed in Critical Patch Updates.

For this Critical Patch Update, Oracle recognizes Okan Basegmez of DORASEC Consulting; Alexander Kornbrust of Red Database Security; David Litchfield of NGS Software; Slavik Markovich of Sentrigo; Aviv Pode of Sentrigo; Amichai Shulman of Imperva, Inc.; and Dennis Yurichev for contributions to Oracle's Security-In-Depth program.
