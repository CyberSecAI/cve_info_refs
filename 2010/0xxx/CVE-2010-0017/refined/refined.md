  "CVE-2010-0017": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation improperly handling a race condition that can occur when handling Negotiate responses.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of a race condition in SMB client when handling Negotiate responses."
      ],
      "impact": "On Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the system. On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the vulnerability can lead to elevation of privilege, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code with system-level privileges. Additionally, on all affected platforms, exploitation can cause a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can host a malicious SMB server and convince a user to initiate an SMB connection with it.",
        "An attacker on the local network could perform a man-in-the-middle attack to respond to a legitimate SMB request with a malformed SMB response.",
         "To elevate privileges, an attacker must first log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "To exploit the remote code execution or denial of service, the attacker needs to host a malicious SMB server and convince a user to connect to it, or perform a man-in-the-middle attack. To elevate privileges on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the attacker needs valid logon credentials and local access."
