Subject: CVE Request: ViewVC 1.1.4 / 1.0.10 -- XSS via user-provided query
 form input

Just received an announcement stating ViewVC 1.1.4 and 1.0.10 were
released today. Looks like they fix an XSS that needs a CVE assigned.

"security fix: escape user-provided query form input to avoid XSS
attack"

<http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/viewvc/trunk/CHANGES?r1=2313&r2=2342&pathrev=HEAD>

Here's the patch for the XSS:
<http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/viewvc?view=rev&revision=2326>

* lib/viewvc.py
  (view_queryform): Escape user-provided input before passing it
    directly off to the templates.  Can you say "XSS attack vector"?

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
