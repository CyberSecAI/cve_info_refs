## Synopsis

Important: kvm security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0271)

## Topic

Updated kvm packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and add
enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

A flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by
the Linux virtio-net driver, used by guest operating systems. Due to a
deficiency in the TSO (TCP segment offloading) implementation, a guest's
virtio-net driver would transmit improper data to a certain QEMU-KVM
process on the host, causing the guest to crash. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send specially-crafted data to a target guest system,
causing that guest to crash. (CVE-2010-0741)

Additionally, these updated packages include numerous bug fixes and
enhancements. Refer to the KVM chapter of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5
Technical Notes for details:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5.5/html/Technical_Notes/kvm.html>

All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve this
issue as well as fixing the bugs and adding the enhancements noted in the
Technical Notes. Note: The procedure in the Solution section must be
performed before this update will take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

The following procedure must be performed before this update will take
effect:

1) Stop all KVM guest virtual machines.

2) Either reboot the hypervisor machine or, as the root user, remove (using
"modprobe -r [module]") and reload (using "modprobe [module]") all of the
following modules which are currently running (determined using "lsmod"):
kvm, ksm, kvm-intel or kvm-amd.

3) Restart the KVM guest virtual machines.

RHSA-2010:0476 - Security Advisory

Issued:

2010-06-22
# RHSA-2010:0476 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes two security issues, multiple
bugs, and adds enhancements is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the
Linux virtio-net driver, used by guest operating systems. Due to a
deficiency in the TSO (TCP segment offloading) implementation, a guest's
virtio-net driver would transmit improper data to a certain QEMU-KVM
process on the host, causing the guest to crash. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send specially-crafted data to a target guest system,
causing that guest to crash. (CVE-2010-0741)

A flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)
handled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an
image or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely
deleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a
new, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it,
could use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs,
potentially disclosing sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2223)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for dbus issue
CVE-2009-1189; kernel issues CVE-2010-0307, CVE-2010-0410, CVE-2010-0730,
CVE-2010-1085, and CVE-2010-1086; openldap issue CVE-2009-3767; and sudo
issues CVE-2010-0426, CVE-2010-0427, and CVE-2010-1163.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds several enhancements.
Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available from
<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/2.2/html/Servers-5.5-2.2_Hypervisor_Security_Update>

As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
fixes and enhancements from the KVM updates RHSA-2010:0271 and
RHBA-2010:0419 have been included in this update. Also included are the bug
fixes and enhancements from the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)
update RHSA-2010:0473, and fence-agents update RHBA-2010:0477.

KVM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0271.html> and
<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0419.html> VDSM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0473.html> fence-agents: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0477.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues and adds these
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
