      "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Orbital Viewer 1.04 when processing .ov files.",

        "Maliciously crafted .ov file."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted '.ov' file and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable application.",
      "additional_details": "The exploit utilizes a Structured Exception Handling (SEH) overwrite technique to gain control of the execution flow. The provided perl exploit creates a malicious .ov file containing a header, padding, a shellcode, a jump instruction to avoid SEH overwrite and the SEH overwrite itself pointing to a pop ebx, pop eax, ret gadget.
