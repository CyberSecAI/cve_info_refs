    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-0551",
      "root_cause": "Faulty implementation of HTTP Digest Authentication in Geo++(R) GNCASTER software.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The server accepts HTTP Basic Authentication despite requiring HTTP Digest.",
        "The server generates the nonce for HTTP Digest authentication only once at startup, making it vulnerable to replay attacks.",
        "The server's response to failed authentication requests discloses 32 bytes of memory, potentially containing other users' HTTP requests, including authentication headers."
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can replay recorded login communications to gain access to the admin interface. Attackers might be able to gather other users' authentication headers from memory disclosed by the server.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept user login communication.",
         "Sending crafted requests to the server to leak memory data."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to record network traffic between the client and the server, and to send HTTP requests to the server.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is considered low risk because the admin interface does not seem to offer much functionality. The nonce is a base64-encoded concatenation of the server start time and a 16 byte hex string. The memory disclosure is dependent on the length of the HTTP request sent."
