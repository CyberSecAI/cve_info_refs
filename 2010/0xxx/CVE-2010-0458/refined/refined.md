  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the 'note' parameter of the blog.php script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, and potentially other confidential information stored in the database (specifically, the websiteadmin_admin_users table).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the 'note' parameter in the URL of the blog.php script.",
