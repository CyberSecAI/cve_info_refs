Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2010-0436 vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability is a race condition within the KDE Display Manager (KDM).

*   **Weakness:**
    *   KDM uses a user-owned directory to store a command socket.
    *   A local user can prevent the removal of this directory.
    *   This allows the user to create a race condition that, when exploited, could cause KDM to set an arbitrary file on the filesystem to be world-writable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   A successful attack can lead to local privilege escalation, potentially allowing a local attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   A local attacker with a valid local account and access to a console running KDM can exploit this flaw.
    *   The attacker needs to prevent the removal of the directory KDM uses for the command socket.

*   **Affected Systems:**
    *   KDM as shipped with KDE SC 2.2.0 up to and including KDE SC 4.4.2
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5
    *   openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, and 11.2
    *   SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3 and SLE11
    *   Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (lenny)

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Apply the patches provided by your OS vendor or binary package provider.
    *   For Red Hat systems, after applying the update and rebooting, administrators should manually remove leftover user-owned `dmctl-*` directories in `/var/run/xdmctl/`.
