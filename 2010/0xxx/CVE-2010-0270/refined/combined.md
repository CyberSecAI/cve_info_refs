How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-020 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in SMB Client Could Allow Remote Code Execution (980232)

Published: April 13, 2010 | Updated: May 26, 2010

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sent a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must convince the user to initiate an SMB connection to a specially crafted SMB server.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the manner in which the SMB client handles SMB responses, allocates memory, and validates fields within the SMB response. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 977544](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/977544).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 980232](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/980232) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation handles specially crafted SMB responses. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the computer to stop responding until restarted.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3676](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3676).

#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This denial-of-service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop responding until manually restarted.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.

#### Workarounds for SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. For this specific vulnerability, both inbound and outbound SMB traffic should be blocked to reduce exposure. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding until it is manually restarted. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop responding until manually restarted.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists because the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation incorrectly handles incomplete SMB responses.

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol?**

Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a Microsoft network file sharing protocol used in Microsoft Windows. For more information on SMB, see the MSDN article, Microsoft SMB Protocol and CIFS Protocol Overview.

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block Version 2 (SMBv2)?**

Server Message Block (SMB) is the file sharing protocol used by default on Windows-based computers. SMB Version 2.0 (SMBv2) is an update to this protocol, and is only supported on computers running Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. SMBv2 can only be used if both client and server support it. If either client or server cannot support SMBv2, the SMB 1.0 protocol will be used instead. The SMB protocol version to be used for file operations is decided during the negotiation phase. During the negotiation phase, a Windows Vista client advertises to the server that it can understand the new SMBv2 protocol. If the server (Windows Server 2008 or later) understands SMBv2, then SMBv2 is chosen for subsequent communication. Otherwise the client and server use SMB 1.0 and continue to function as normal. For more information on SMBv2, see the MSDN article, [Server Message Block (SMB) Version 2 Protocol Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc246482%28prot.13%29.aspx).

**What is the difference between SMBv1 and SMBv2?**

Both protocols are used by clients to request file and print services from a server system over the network. Both are stateful protocols in which clients establish a connection to a server, establish an authenticated context on that connection, and then issue a variety of requests to access files, printers, and named pipes for interprocess communication. The SMBv2 protocol is a major revision of the existing SMB protocol. While many of the underlying concepts are the same, the packet formats are completely different. In addition to providing all of the capabilities found in SMBv1, the SMBv2 protocol provides several enhancements:

* Allowing an open to a file to be reestablished after a client connection becomes temporarily disconnected.
* Allowing the server to balance the number of simultaneous operations that a client can have outstanding at any time.
* Providing scalability in terms of the number of shares, users, and simultaneously open files.
* Supporting symbolic links.
* Using a stronger algorithm to validate the integrity of requests and responses.

**What versions of SMB are impacted by this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability affects both SMBv1 and SMBv2.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a user's system to stop responding until manually restarted.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted SMB server that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to initiate an SMB connection with it. Additionally, an attacker on the local network could perform a man-in-the-middle attack to respond to a legitimate SMB request with a malformed SMB response.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk.

**Can this vulnerability be exploited using Internet Explorer?**

No. However, this issue may be exploited through Web transactions, regardless of browser type. In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web page that contains a specially crafted URI. A user who browsed that Web site will force an SMB connection to an SMB server controlled by the attacker, which would then send a malformed response back to the user. This response would result in the users' system becoming nonresponsive. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What is a URI?**

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to act on or identify resources from the Internet or over a network. A URL is a typical example of a URI that references a resource such as a Web site. For more information about URIs, see [RFC-2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the SMB client handles incomplete SMB responses.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-3676](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3676).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## SMB Client Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0269

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation allocates memory when parsing specially crafted SMB responses. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0269](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0269).

This response would result in the users' system becoming nonresponsive. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What is a URI?**

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to act on or identify resources from the Internet or over a network. A URL is a typical example of a URI that references a resource such as a Web site. For more information about URIs, see [RFC-2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).

## SMB Client Response Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0476

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation parses specially crafted SMB transaction responses. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0476](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0476).

#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Client Response Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0476

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.

#### Workarounds for SMB Client Response Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0476

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. For this specific vulnerability, both inbound and outbound SMB traffic should be blocked to reduce exposure. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for SMB Client Response Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0476

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists because the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation improperly parses specially crafted SMB transaction responses. This could lead to a memory corruption issue resulting in code execution with system-level privileges.

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol?**

Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a Microsoft network file sharing protocol used in Microsoft Windows. For more information on SMB, see the MSDN article, [Microsoft SMB Protocol and CIFS Protocol Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa365233%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block Version 2 (SMBv2)?**

Server Message Block (SMB) is the file sharing protocol used by default on Windows-based computers. SMB Version 2.0 (SMBv2) is an update to this protocol, and is only supported on computers running Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. SMBv2 can only be used if both client and server support it. If either client or server cannot support SMBv2, the SMB 1.0 protocol will be used instead. The SMB protocol version to be used for file operations is decided during the negotiation phase. During the negotiation phase, a Windows Vista client advertises to the server that it can understand the new SMBv2 protocol. If the server (Windows Server 2008 or later) understands SMBv2, then SMBv2 is chosen for subsequent communication. Otherwise the client and server use SMB 1.0 and continue to function as normal. For more information on SMBv2, see the MSDN article, [Server Message Block (SMB) Version 2 Protocol Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc246482%28prot.13%29.aspx).

**What is the difference between SMBv1 and SMBv2?**

Both protocols are used by clients to request file and print services from a server system over the network. Both are stateful protocols in which clients establish a connection to a server, establish an authenticated context on that connection, and then issue a variety of requests to access files, printers, and named pipes for interprocess communication. The SMBv2 protocol is a major revision of the existing SMB protocol. While many of the underlying concepts are the same, the packet formats are completely different. In addition to providing all of the capabilities found in SMBv1, the SMBv2 protocol provides several enhancements:

* Allowing an open to a file to be reestablished after a client connection becomes temporarily disconnected.
* Allowing the server to balance the number of simultaneous operations that a client can have outstanding at any time.
* Providing scalability in terms of the number of shares, users, and simultaneously open files.
* Supporting symbolic links.
* Using a stronger algorithm to validate the integrity of requests and responses.

**What versions of SMB are impacted by this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability affects both SMBv1 and SMBv2.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Most attempts to exploit this vulnerability will cause an affected system to stop responding and restart.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted SMB server that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to initiate an SMB connection with it. Additionally, an attacker on the local network could perform a man-in-the-middle attack to respond to a legitimate SMB request with a malformed SMB response.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk.

**Why are Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 listed as Low severity?**

Although this vulnerability does not directly affect these platforms, there may be third-party TDI filters vulnerable to this issue. The update addresses this issue. These platforms are not delivered with any TDI filters that are vulnerable to this issue. Microsoft is not aware of any third-party TDI filters that are affected by this issue.

**Can this vulnerability be exploited using Internet Explorer?**

No. However, this issue may be exploited through Web transactions, regardless of browser type. In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web page that contains a specially crafted URI. A user who browsed that Web site will force an SMB connection to an SMB server controlled by the attacker, which would then send a malformed response back to the user. This response would result in the users' system becoming nonresponsive. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
