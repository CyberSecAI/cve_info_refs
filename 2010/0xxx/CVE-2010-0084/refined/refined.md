Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0084:

**Summary:**

CVE-2010-0084 is a vulnerability affecting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), allowing for potential unauthorized information disclosure. It's important to note that while the CVE description is vague, the provided documents, especially the HP and Oracle advisories, offer more specific details. The vulnerability is related to how the JRE handles certain sensitive objects, potentially allowing attackers to leak private information.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way the Java Runtime Environment handles certain sensitive objects, specifically in the `Policy/PolicyFile`. It does not correctly manage dynamic protection domains. This can lead to information disclosure because of improper handling of access permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the potential for an attacker to leak sensitive information due to improper handling of dynamic protection domains.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate access control mechanisms for certain sensitive objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker obtaining private or sensitive information from the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation via Applets:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to run a maliciously crafted applet.
*  **Network-Based Attacks**:  The vulnerability is network exploitable without requiring authentication (AV:N/Au:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Applet:**  Attackers need the ability to serve a malicious applet to the victim. This could be done via a compromised website or other means of delivering web content.
*  **No Special Privileges**:  No special privileges are needed by the attacker to launch the exploit.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects various Java versions, including Java SE, Java for Business, and OpenJDK, which impacts a variety of systems, including HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows.
*   **Fix:** The issue was resolved by updating to newer versions of Java (e.g., 1.6.0_20, 1.5.0_24, and subsequent versions) and implementing patches.
*   **CVSS Score:** The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) according to the HP bulletin which corresponds to a Medium severity.
*   **Specifics on Dynamic Protection Domains:**  The vulnerability is related to how the JRE handles dynamic protection domains within the `Policy/PolicyFile` component.
*  **Impact on Oracle Products:** Several Oracle products that embed a JDK are affected and customers are urged to apply relevant patches.
*  **Specifics from Apple:** Apple also identified this vulnerability as part of their Java security updates, affecting Mac OS X v10.5.8 and v10.6.3. The description explicitly mentions an untrusted Java applet.
*   **Mitigation:** Workarounds such as blocking network protocols may reduce the risk.
*  **Open Source Projects Affected:** OpenJDK is also impacted, requiring updates to address this.
*   **Red Hat Support:** Red Hat has also addressed this issue as part of a larger set of Java security fixes.

**In summary,** CVE-2010-0084 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Java that is remotely exploitable. Attackers can potentially steal private data by exploiting a flaw in how dynamic protection domains are handled. Affected users should apply the updates provided by their vendor as soon as possible.
