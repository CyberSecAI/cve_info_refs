{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An inconsistency between instruction decoding tables and the actual MMIO instruction decoder implementation in the Xen hypervisor.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent instruction decoding.",
      "Improper handling of MMIO instructions."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest userspace process, with access to an MMIO region, can trick the hypervisor into emulating an instruction that crashes the guest, leading to a denial of service. Specifically, the ARPL instruction when executed on an MMIO area would cause a crash.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious guest userspace process can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a guest VM and have access to an MMIO region. While difficult from non-root within the guest, it is theoretically possible."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_systems": "32bit guests running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.",
     "mitigation": "The fix involves changing the failure path to inject a #UD exception instead of crashing the domain. The guest kernel will then transform the #UD into a SIGILL.",
    "notable_points": [
         "This issue does not affect the upstream Xen project.",
          "The vulnerability was found by Paolo Bonzini"
        ]
