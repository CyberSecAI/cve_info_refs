How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-03-12 14:07:43 UTC  ``` Paolo Bonzini found a bug in Xen hypervisor that can be used to crash the guest. Malicious guest userspace process can trick the hypervisor into emulating instruction that causes the crash if it has access to an MMIO region. The bug can be exploited because of an inconsistency between instruction decoding tables and the actual MMIO instruction decoder implementation.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c14)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-04-21 01:49:02 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect upstream.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c15)  Petr Matousek    2010-04-27 16:27:19 UTC  ``` This issue affects 32bit guests only.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c18)  Josh Bressers    2010-05-06 17:43:20 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 18:49:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0398 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0398.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c20)  Jarod Wilson    2010-05-19 19:00:33 UTC  ``` in kernel-2.6.18-199.el5 You can download this test kernel from <http://people.redhat.com/jwilson/el5>  Please update the appropriate value in the Verified field (cf_verified) to indicate this fix has been successfully verified.

Malicious guest userspace process can trick the hypervisor into emulating instruction that causes the crash if it has access to an MMIO region. The bug can be exploited because of an inconsistency between instruction decoding tables and the actual MMIO instruction decoder implementation.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c14)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-04-21 01:49:02 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect upstream.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c15)  Petr Matousek    2010-04-27 16:27:19 UTC  ``` This issue affects 32bit guests only.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c18)  Josh Bressers    2010-05-06 17:43:20 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 18:49:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0398 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0398.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=572971#c20)  Jarod Wilson    2010-05-19 19:00:33 UTC  ``` in kernel-2.6.18-199.el5 You can download this test kernel from <http://people.redhat.com/jwilson/el5>  Please update the appropriate value in the Verified field (cf_verified) to indicate this fix has been successfully verified.

kernel security and bug fix update (RHSA-2010-0398)

Original Release Date: June 1, 2010

Last Revised: December 9, 2011

Number: ASA-2010-144

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

\* a flaw was found in the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
(ULE)
implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted ISO
MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) frame to a target system, resulting in an
infinite loop (denial of service). The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1086](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1086.html) to this issue.

\* on AMD64 systems, it was discovered that the kernel did not ensure
the
ELF interpreter was available before making a call to the
SET\_PERSONALITY
macro. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service
by
running a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit
application.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name [CVE-2010-0307](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0307.html) to this issue.

\* a flaw was found in the kernel connector implementation. A local,
unprivileged user could trigger this flaw by sending an arbitrary number
of notification requests using specially-crafted netlink messages,
resulting in a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-0410](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0410.html) to this issue.

\* a flaw was found in the Memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) instruction
decoder in
the Xen hypervisor implementation. An unprivileged guest user could use
this flaw to trick the hypervisor into emulating a certain instruction,
which could crash the guest (denial of service). The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name
[CVE-2010-0730](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0730.html) to this issue.

\* a divide-by-zero flaw was found in the azx\_position\_ok() function
in the
driver for Intel High Definition Audio, snd-hda-intel. A local,
unprivileged user could trigger this flaw to cause a kernel crash
(denial
of service). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1085.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0398.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with the RHEL5 kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services | 5.2.x | Low | Upgrade to AES 6.1 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ Communication Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0 | Low | Customers running CM 5.2.1 install Kernel Service Pack 3 or later, or upgrade to CM 6.0.1 or later. Customers running CM 6.0 upgrade to CM 6.0.1 or later. |
| Avaya IQ | 5.0, 5.1 | Low | Upgrade to IQ 5.2 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2, 6.0 | Low | Upgrade to SM 6.1 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager | 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Customers running SMGR 5.2 or 6.0 upgrade to SMGR 6.0 SP1.  Customers running SMGR 6.1 or 6.1.1 upgrade to SMGR 6.1.2 or later. |

| Avaya Voice Portal | 5.0, 5.1, 5.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to VP 5.1.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly
recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the
event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that
customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

Message-ID: <4BE3AC76.50703@redhat.com>
Date: Fri, 07 May 2010 14:00:22 +0800
From: Eugene Teo <eugene@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE-2010-0730 xen: emulator instruction decoding inconsistency

Assigned with CVE-2010-0730. It does not affect upstream. For more info,
please see <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2010-0730>.

Due to a mismatch between the opcode decoding table and the
implementation of the operand decoder in platform.c, the ARPL
instruction would cause the guest to crash if executed on a MMIO area.
While this is difficult to exploit from non-root, it is theoretically
possible to do so.

This fix changes the failure path to inject #UD instead of crashing the
domain. The guest kernel will transform the #UD into a SIGILL.

3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.

```
  * Hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Fusion.
```
```
 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.
