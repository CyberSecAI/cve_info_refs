Debian Security Advisory DSA-1992-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                 Nico Golde
February 4th, 2010                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : chrony
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : none
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-0292 CVE-2010-0293 CVE-2010-0294

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in chrony, a pair of programs
which are used to maintain the accuracy of the system clock on a computer.
This issues are similar to the NTP security flaw CVE-2009-3563.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-0292

  chronyd replies to all cmdmon packets with NOHOSTACCESS messages even for
  unauthorized hosts.  An attacker can abuse this behaviour to force two
  chronyd instances to play packet ping-pong by sending such a packet with
  spoofed source address and port.  This results in high CPU and network
  usage and thus denial of service conditions.

CVE-2010-0293

  The client logging facility of chronyd doesn't limit memory that is used
  to store client information.  An attacker can cause chronyd to allocate
  large amounts of memory by sending NTP or cmdmon packets with spoofed
  source addresses resulting in memory exhaustion.

CVE-2010-0294

  chronyd lacks of a rate limit control to the syslog facility when logging
  received packets from unauthorized hosts.  This allows an attacker to
  cause denial of service conditions via filling up the logs and thus disk
  space by repeatedly sending invalid cmdmon packets.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.21z-5+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.23-6+lenny1.

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c0)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-14 15:21:48 UTC  ``` Description of problem: This is similar to NTP security flaw [CVE-2009-3563](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3563).  chronyd replies to all cmdmon packets from unauthorized hosts with NOHOSTACCESS message.  This can be used to create a loop between two chrony daemons which don't allow cmdmon access from each other by sending a packet with spoofed source address and port. This will cause high CPU, network and syslog usage.  The applies to all chrony versions including 1.24-pre1.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c1)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-14 15:23:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 383695](attachment.cgi?id=383695&action=diff "chrony-1.23-0001-Don-t-reply-to-invalid-chronyc-packets.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=383695&action=edit "chrony-1.23-0001-Don-t-reply-to-invalid-chronyc-packets.patch") chrony-1.23-0001-Don-t-reply-to-invalid-chronyc-packets.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c2)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-14 15:23:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 383696](attachment.cgi?id=383696&action=diff "chrony-1.23-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=383696&action=edit "chrony-1.23-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch") chrony-1.23-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c3)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-14 15:23:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 383697](attachment.cgi?id=383697&action=diff "chrony-1.24pre1-0001-Don-t-reply-to-invalid-chronyc-packets.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=383697&action=edit "chrony-1.24pre1-0001-Don-t-reply-to-invalid-chronyc-packets.patch") chrony-1.24pre1-0001-Don-t-reply-to-invalid-chronyc-packets.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c4)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-14 15:24:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 383698](attachment.cgi?id=383698&action=diff "chrony-1.24pre1-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=383698&action=edit "chrony-1.24pre1-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch") chrony-1.24pre1-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c5)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-14 15:35:59 UTC  ``` There is also a possible security bug in chrony versions before 1.24-pre1.  The client logging facility doesn't limit memory which is used to keep informations about clients. If chronyd is configured to allow access from a large IP address range, an attacker can cause chronyd to allocate large amount of memory by sending NTP or cmdmon packets with spoofed source addresses. By default only 127.0.0.1 is allowed.  The noclientlog option can be used to disable the logging facility, but it's not very clear from the documentation that there could be a problem with allocating too much memory.  This was fixed in 1.24-pre1 by implementing clientloglimit option, set to 512KB by default.  <http://git.tuxfamily.org/chrony/chrony.git/?p=gitroot/chrony/chrony.git;a=commitdiff;h=618f372e13c884585402e39d6ca244f78144b68f;hp=8f72155b438494e6d8e9e75920c36fd88d90f5b2>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c6)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-14 15:36:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 383702](attachment.cgi?id=383702&action=diff "chrony-1.23-0003-Add-option-to-limit-clientlog-memory.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=383702&action=edit "chrony-1.23-0003-Add-option-to-limit-clientlog-memory.patch") chrony-1.23-0003-Add-option-to-limit-clientlog-memory.patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c7)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-14 21:10:10 UTC  ``` Hi Miroslav,  This bug isn't completely clear to me. This is certainly two flaws  * chronyd replies to all cmdmon packets from unauthorized hosts * chronyd client memory use  But what about the syslog limit. From what I can understand, a malicious remote user could fill up the syslog, or will the previous two fixes prevent this from happening?  Once I know more, I can assign CVE ids.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c8)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-15 11:26:33 UTC  ``` Yes, I forgot to mention that. That's a third flaw.  There are several ways how attacker can make chronyd log messages. Not sure if it includes the sendto calls addressed in the patch, I've included them just to be safe.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c9)  Miroslav Lichvar    2010-01-15 11:56:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 384593](attachment.cgi?id=384593&action=diff "chrony-1.23-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=384593&action=edit "chrony-1.23-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch") chrony-1.23-0002-Limit-rate-of-syslog-messages.patch  Missed one sendto call in ntp_io.c   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c10)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-21 14:06:21 UTC  ``` CVE ids are assigned as such:  [CVE-2010-0292](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0292) cmdmon network DoS [CVE-2010-0293](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0293) many client memory DoS [CVE-2010-0294](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0294) syslog limit   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=555367#c11)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-06 00:05:20 UTC  ``` chrony-1.23-6.20081106gitbe42b4.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.
