  "CVE-2010-0020": {
    "description": "An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol software handles specially crafted SMB packets. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network message to a system running the Server service as an authenticated user. While an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system, attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a Denial of Service condition.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) implementation improperly validating fields in a malformed SMB request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system. Can also lead to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted SMB packet to a system running the Server service."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Valid logon credentials"
    ],
     "additional_details": "Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter by blocking SMB ports (139 and 445) from the Internet. The vulnerability cannot be exploited by anonymous users. Exploitation could take complete control of an affected system."
