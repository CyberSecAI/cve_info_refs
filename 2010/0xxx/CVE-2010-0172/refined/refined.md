  "CVE-2010-0172": {
    "description": "The asynchronous Authorization Prompt (HTTP username and password) was not always attached to the correct window. Although we have not demonstrated this, it may be possible for a malicious page to convince a user to open a new tab or popup to a trusted service and then have the HTTP authorization prompt from the malicious page appear to be the login prompt for the trusted page. This potential attack is greatly mitigated by the fact that very few web sites use HTTP authorization, preferring instead to use web forms and cookies.",
    "root_cause": "The asynchronous Authorization Prompt was not correctly associated with the DOM window that triggered it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect window association for asynchronous authorization prompts"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious page could potentially trick a user into providing their credentials by displaying a fake authentication prompt associated with a different (trusted) window. This is possible if the malicious page can trigger an HTTP authentication prompt and then have the prompt displayed on a different window (tab or popup).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious web page triggers an HTTP auth request, and then a separate window is opened to a trusted site."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a web page that can trigger an HTTP auth request. They also need to be able to convince the user to open a new tab or popup to a trusted service."
