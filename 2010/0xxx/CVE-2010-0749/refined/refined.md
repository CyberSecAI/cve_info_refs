During endgame, Transmission can double-request a block from two peers. (This isn't the problem... all clients do this. If you're new to this idea, go Google \"endgame\") *If* one of those peers is the Bad peer, and *if* the good peer's block comes in first and *if* that block completes the piece, then we checksum the piece and mark it as good. *Then* when the bad peer sends in its bad version of the block, we wrongly save it too, instead of throwing it away. And since the piece is already flagged as complete, we don't re-checksum it.",
