### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

### [CVEProject/cve-schema](/CVEProject/cve-schema)[Support PURL as identifier](/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/173)

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.

## About

Transmission is a fast, easy, and free BitTorrent client. It comes in several flavors:

* A native macOS GUI application
* GTK+ and Qt GUI applications for Linux, BSD, etc.
* A Qt-based Windows-compatible GUI application
* A headless daemon for servers and routers
* A web UI for remote controlling any of the above

Visit <https://transmissionbt.com/> for more information.

## Documentation

[Transmission's documentation](/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/README.md) is currently out-of-date, but the team has recently begun a new project to update it and is looking for volunteers. If you're interested, please feel free to submit pull requests!

## Command line interface notes

Transmission is fully supported in transmission-remote, the preferred cli client.

Three standalone tools to examine, create, and edit .torrent files exist: transmission-show, transmission-create, and transmission-edit, respectively.

Prior to development of transmission-remote, the standalone client transmission-cli was created. Limited to a single torrent at a time, transmission-cli is deprecated and exists primarily to support older hardware dependent upon it. In almost all instances, transmission-remote should be used instead.

Different distributions may choose to package any or all of these tools in one or more separate packages.

## Building

Transmission has an Xcode project file (Transmission.xcodeproj) for building in Xcode.

For a more detailed description, and dependencies, visit [How to Build Transmission](/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/Building-Transmission.md) in docs

### Building a Transmission release from the command line

```
$ tar xf transmission-4.0.6.tar.xz
$ cd transmission-4.0.6
# Use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo to build optimized binary with debug information. (preferred)
# Use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release to build full optimized binary.
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
$ cd build
$ cmake --build .
$ sudo cmake --install .
```

### Building Transmission from the nightly builds

Download a tarball from <https://build.transmissionbt.com/job/trunk-linux/> and follow the steps from the previous section.

If you're new to building programs from source code, this is typically easier than building from Git.

### Building Transmission from Git (first time)

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/transmission/transmission Transmission
$ cd Transmission
# Use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo to build optimized binary with debug information. (preferred)
# Use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release to build full optimized binary.
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
$ cd build
$ cmake --build .
$ sudo cmake --install .
```

### Building Transmission from Git (updating)

```
$ cd Transmission/build
$ cmake --build . -t clean
$ git submodule foreach --recursive git clean -xfd
$ git pull --rebase --prune
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cmake --build .
$ sudo cmake --install .
```

## Contributing

### Code Style

You would want to setup your editor to make use of the .clang-format file located in the root of this repository and the eslint/prettier rules in web/package.json.

If for some reason you are unwilling or unable to do so, there is a shell script which you can use: `./code_style.sh`

## Description

I have had problems with torrents that are at 100% not being fully downloaded. My files are corrupt until I do a verify and then it usually tells me its downloading at 98.x% again. Usually a verify will fix it first time. Other times I've had to import the torrent to azureus to finish it off properly.

This has happened to me before. My theory is that for some reason Transmission will download a corrupt part from someone but not realize it until you do a manual verify. At this point T will recognize the bad part and redownload it **from the same person**, which just causes the problem again. This is my theory.

I just had this happen to me.

I noticed the file sounded strange when playing in iTunes, so I tried to recheck it. Turns out it had some corrupt pieces. It downloaded anew, I took a new recheck and it still had a corrupt piece. It managed to get it correctly on the last download.

I was actually manage to reproduce this just now, so I'm opening the bug again. Send me an email Charles, and I'll give you the .torrent file.

Running 1.91 (10268)

Sent you an email about it, I'll add it here for completeness sake:
How I reproduced this:
Running 1.91 for OS X
Open the torrent in Transmission
Choose to only download the first track
Wait for it to finish
Choose "Verify Local Data" from the Transfers menu
Discover that some pieces are corrupt.

If it matters, I'm on a fast internet connection currently. Transmission reports speeds up to 3 MB/s during the short download.
I tested capping the speed at 100 KB/s, that lead to less pieces having to be redownloaded, so it seems to be affected by the download speed.

I can confirm this. While reading through this ticket a download finished, so I was just curious and verified it. As it turn out, it had a few corrupt pieces.

| Component: | Transmission → libtransmission |

| Milestone: | None Set → 1.92 |
| Resolution: | → fixed |
| Status: | reopened → closed |
| Summary: | Not fully downloading torrent despite 100% status → Local data can be corrupted by bad peers when Transmission accepts duplicate blocks during endgame |

Okay, after downloading a specific single file again... and again... and again... and again... I've finally found a pattern:

In the swarm that was emailed to me, there's at least one Bad peer constantly sending bad blocks out to everyone. During endgame, Transmission can double-request a block from two peers. (This isn't the problem... all clients do this. If you're new to this idea, go Google "endgame") *If* one of those peers is the Bad peer, and *if* the good peer's block comes in first and *if* that block completes the piece, then we checksum the piece and mark it as good. *Then* when the bad peer sends in its bad version of the block, we wrongly save it too, instead of throwing it away. And since the piece is already flagged as complete, we don't re-checksum it.

I've committed a fix for this behavior to trunk in [r10325](/changeset/10325 "(trunk libT) #1242 \"don't accept duplicate blocks during endgame\" -- ...") for 1.92. I think it's "the" fix and ran 10 trials after making the change, and can no longer trigger the corruption bug.

Since so many "ifs" were required to tickle this bug in the first place, I'd be happy if other people could test it out to try and confirm the fix.

I haven't been able to reproduce it again, but I had to test on other torrents than my original as the peer that sent the bad data must have disappeared.

I've downloaded a bunch of torrents which should at least have generated this bug once, but it didn't. So as far as I'm concerned, this bug is solved.

Please let me know if I should open a new ticket on this, but I seem to be seeing this same behavior in Transmission 2.33.

A torrent will "successfully" complete, then after doing a "verify local data", I'll see a chunk is missing/corrupt, and it'll download again. Usually this amounts to about 0.01-0.03%. Then reverifying results in the same thing, though usually after about 5-10 times of doing this over and over, things finally work and I get a fully verifiable torrent.

Could this fix have been rolled back for some reason? Or this "bug" reappear due to some other change?

Nope, it hasn't been rolled back.

> Or this "bug" reappear due to some other change?

You're the first person to report it, but sure it's possible. Is the behavior repeatable? consistent? Can you give me a walkthrough of the exact steps I should follow to trigger the behavior?

I have experienced this bug too, in 2 distinct files.

I believe I might have ran out of disk space in the middle of the transfer and from that point on the data is all bad.
This 2nd file stopped at around 50-60% because of disk space, I deleted some stuff and resumed, it downloaded till 99 or 98 and said to verify data, I just did resume and it went to 100%. Tried to open the file and it was damaged, so I did a Verify Local Data and the file went back to 50%...

Thanks for the report, but it sounds like a separate issue unrelated to the endgame bug which this ticket was closed for 18 months ago.

I'm going to reclose this ticket, but please feel free to open a new ticket will a full description / walkthrough of the issue you're seeing. Thank you!

### [comment:25](#comment:25) by staze, [13 years ago](/timeline?from=2011-09-01T22%3A11%3A31Z&precision=second "See timeline at Sep 1, 2011, 10:11:31 PM")

See, I'm not sure if it's the same bug or not. It SOUNDS like the same bug. You download something, and once Transmission says it's done, you, say, go to unrar everything, and that throws an error saying CRC failed. So you do a "Verify Local Data" with Trasmission, and it gets to be about 99-99.98% complete, then redownloads a chunk. So you do a Verify again, and it proceeds to download the "same" data again. But as you do this several times, the chunk it's redownloading seems to get smaller, until about 5-10 times later, you have something that's complete.

I'm not sure how reproducible it is, other than several of the torrents I've downloaded as of late have done this. However, I have not seen this issue on another machine.

Computer in question is a Mac Mini 2009, RAID1 HD setup, with 4GB of ram, running 10.6.8 1.1 server. If you could point me in the direction of how to adequately test something like this, I'd be happy to.

My issue isn't due to disk space. I have 200-300GB available on that drive at all times.

Hi! I'm experiencing the same problem. Torrents finish 100% download but after some hours, become paused with this error and a completion of 99.x%. Verify local data does not change its state and when started again, the problem is repeated over and over, with several files (not all). I'm running Transmission 2.52 (13304) on Debian Sid. I've already checked that is not a disk problem, as it happens in different machines, with ext3, ext4 and ntfs filesystems.
Could you please tell me how can I bring more information for this issue?

I'm using Transmission 2.61 (13407) on Linux Mint 14 and I'm experiencing the same thing as reyiyo. dmesg doesn't show any disk/fs problem, and smartctl reports that my drives are fine. Verify local data sometimes makes the problem go away.

Note that I've only noticed this recently, with multiple torrents open (~20 of them) and mostly seeding, not downloading.

williampoetra: Please see [#4649](/ticket/4649 "#4649: Enhancement: Option to Automatically Verify Local Data on Completion (reopened)").

I'm giving this issue a CVE ID too. I think this issue is a bit on the

that is hard to fix, it should get one.

Use CVE-2010-0749

Thanks.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
