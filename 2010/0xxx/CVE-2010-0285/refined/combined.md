| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=593616#c0)  freggy1    2009-08-31 07:04:27 UTC  ``` Since <http://www.gnome.org/~federico/news-2009-06.html#randr-and-suspending-laptops> , GNOME has improved a lot when suspending my laptop and moving it from a two-monitor setup to a one-monitor setup and the other way round.  However, I now encountered this problem:  1. I start my laptop with a second monitor connected. I put some applications on the second monitor and suspend the system 2. I resume my laptop without external monitor. GNOME automatically disables the second screen and moves all windows to the first screen. Then I suspend the machine. 3. I resume the machine after I have put it in a docking station with an external monitor connected.  On my laptop monitor, I'm greeted with the unlock password dialog. However, the external screen just shows the second half of my GNOME desktop completely unlocked. An application which was running on this second monitor in step 1, is completely usable without entering a password ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=593616#c1)  William Jon McCann    2009-09-02 19:27:55 UTC  ``` Yup.  I see this too. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=593616#c2)  William Jon McCann    2009-09-02 20:57:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 142354](attachment.cgi?id=142354 "debug log") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=142354&action=edit "debug log") debug log  Here is the debug output from when I do the following:   * Have laptop running with no external monitor attached  * Suspend  * Dock  * Resume  * Unlock screensaver  The screensaver is never told that there are non overlapping monitors. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=593616#c3)  Federico Mena Quintero    2009-09-07 19:03:27 UTC  ``` Can you see if gdkscreen-x11.c:process_monitors_change() gets run at all? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=593616#c4)  Federico Mena Quintero    2010-01-13 19:04:23 UTC  ``` Commit 2f597ea9 by Matthias looks promising :)  Does that fix this bug? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=593616#c5)  William Jon McCann    2010-01-29 02:37:22 UTC  ``` Yup that commit should fix it.  Please reopen if not.  Thanks. ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-21 17:53:12 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the GNOME screensaver could insecurely unlock a secondary screen when moving from a single screen display to a dual-screen display.  If a user were to have a suspended laptop, attach an external monitor, resume, and attempt to unlock the GNOME screensaver, the external display will show the GNOME desktop and can be interacted with, without requiring a password.  Upstream has provided a possible patch to correct the issue [2].  [CVE-2010-0285](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0285) has been assigned to this issue.  [1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593616> [2] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=2f597ea9f1f363277fd4dfc109fa41bbc6225aca>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c2)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-21 20:29:01 UTC  ``` I'm scoring this as such:  cvss2=5.6/AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N   Availability Impact is none, as we're talking about an instance here where either someone is sitting at an unused desk, or has stolen the machine (which CVSS2 doesn't really account for). The more likely of situations is a stolen computer. The attacker isn't affecting the availability of the machine, as it's currently not available for this attack to happen.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c3)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-21 21:07:55 UTC  ``` This doesn't affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or 4 as they don't contain gnome-screensaver.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c4)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-21 21:22:21 UTC  ``` I've been told this doesn't affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the extend screen functionality doesn't work there. A second monitor can only be used as a mirror of the first.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-05-19 06:08:22 UTC  ``` Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 does not contain gnome-screensaver.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-21 17:53:12 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the GNOME screensaver could insecurely unlock a secondary screen when moving from a single screen display to a dual-screen display.  If a user were to have a suspended laptop, attach an external monitor, resume, and attempt to unlock the GNOME screensaver, the external display will show the GNOME desktop and can be interacted with, without requiring a password.  Upstream has provided a possible patch to correct the issue [2].  [CVE-2010-0285](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0285) has been assigned to this issue.  [1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593616> [2] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=2f597ea9f1f363277fd4dfc109fa41bbc6225aca>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c2)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-21 20:29:01 UTC  ``` I'm scoring this as such:  cvss2=5.6/AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N   Availability Impact is none, as we're talking about an instance here where either someone is sitting at an unused desk, or has stolen the machine (which CVSS2 doesn't really account for). The more likely of situations is a stolen computer. The attacker isn't affecting the availability of the machine, as it's currently not available for this attack to happen.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c3)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-21 21:07:55 UTC  ``` This doesn't affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or 4 as they don't contain gnome-screensaver.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c4)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-21 21:22:21 UTC  ``` I've been told this doesn't affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as the extend screen functionality doesn't work there. A second monitor can only be used as a mirror of the first.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=557525#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-05-19 06:08:22 UTC  ``` Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 does not contain gnome-screensaver. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not affected by this issue, and it is already fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of gnome-screensaver as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 or 6.   ``` |  |
