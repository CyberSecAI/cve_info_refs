  "CVE-2010-0285": {
    "description": "gnome-screensaver 2.14.3, 2.22.2, 2.27.x, 2.28.0, and 2.28.3, when the X configuration enables the extend screen option, allows physically proximate attackers to bypass screen locking, access an unattended workstation, and view half of the GNOME desktop by attaching an external monitor.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The gnome-screensaver fails to properly lock the secondary screen when moving from a single to a dual-screen setup. Specifically, the screensaver is not notified of the new monitor configuration.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure screen locking mechanism",
         "Failure to handle monitor configuration changes correctly"
      ],
      "impact": "Physical access to the system and bypass of screen locking, leading to unauthorized access of the GNOME desktop and applications running on the secondary screen.",
      "attack_vector": "A physically proximate attacker connects an external monitor to a locked system (typically a laptop) that previously only had one screen enabled (either internal or external)." ,
      "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the system and an external monitor, plus the ability to connect the monitor to the system (e.g., via HDMI or VGA). The system must have been locked in a single monitor configuration and then have an external monitor attached before unlocking. The attacker is not required to have any user credentials."
