Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-0815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) searches for ActiveX controls within a document. A specially crafted document with embedded ActiveX controls can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack memory corruption vulnerability in `VBE6.dll`.
- Improper handling of ActiveX controls by the VBA runtime when processing a specially crafted document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system. This includes:
    - Installing programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creating new user accounts with full rights
- Users with limited rights are less impacted but still at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Files:** The attacker needs to create a file with malicious ActiveX controls.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires a user to open a malicious file through one of the following methods:
    - **Email Attachment:** Opening the malicious document sent as an email attachment.
    - **Web-Based Attack:** Visiting a malicious website hosting a file with malicious ActiveX controls that will exploit the vulnerability when opened.
- An attacker cannot force a user to visit a website, and must convince them via social engineering.
- The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email, requiring manual opening of attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a document with malicious ActiveX controls.
- Ability to deliver this document to the target user through email or hosting it on a web server.
- Social engineering skills to convince users to open malicious files.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, Microsoft Office XP, 2003 and 2007 and third-party applications that use VBA.
- The update modifies how VBA searches for ActiveX controls to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The severity is rated as "Critical" for VBA and "Important" for Office products due to Office products having a built in prompt before activating an embedded ActiveX control.
- Mitigation strategies include disabling ActiveX controls, restricting access to VBE6.dll, and using MOICE when opening files from untrusted sources.
- The vulnerability was not publicly known or exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
- This vulnerability was reported by the NSFocus Security Team.
