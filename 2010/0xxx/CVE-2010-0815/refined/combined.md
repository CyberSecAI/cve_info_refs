## Vulnerability in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Could Allow Remote Code Execution (978213)

Published: May 11, 2010 | Updated: May 19, 2010

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a host application opens and passes a specially crafted file to the Visual Basic for Applications runtime. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported versions of Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications SDK and third-party applications that use Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. This security update is also rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office XP, Microsoft Office 2003, and the 2007 Microsoft Office System. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Visual Basic for Applications searches for ActiveX Controls embedded in documents.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on May 19, 2010?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to more clearly state that the updates for Microsoft Office apply to all supported Microsoft Office suites and other Microsoft Office software that contain a vulnerable version of VBE6.dll. This includes, but is not limited to, supported versions of Microsoft Office Visio and Microsoft Office Project. This also includes Office software that includes VBE6.dll but does not access the vulnerable code such as supported versions of Microsoft Office Outlook and Microsoft Office OneNote.

This is a bulletin-only change. There were no changes to the detection logic or the update files. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems, including customers with automatic updating enabled, do not need to take any action. Customers who have not installed this update previously may need to reassess whether their systems require this update based on the Affected Software table as revised and information provided in this Update FAQ.

**The update is to a shared component used by Microsoft Office. Will the update be offered to Microsoft Office software that includes the shared component, even if the software does not access the vulnerable code?**

Yes, the update will be offered to systems where the vulnerable shared Office component is detected. This is true even for cases where the Office software includes VBE6.dll but does not access the vulnerable code. Consult the following table for examples of Office software that this update applies to.

| Microsoft Office | Is VBE6.dll included with this software? | Does the software access the vulnerable code? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office XP, Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 Microsoft Office System | Yes | Yes, components such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint |
| Microsoft Office OneNote 2003, Microsoft Office OneNote 2007 | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Office Outlook 2003, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Office Project 2002, Microsoft Office Project 2003, Microsoft Office Project 2007 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office Visio 2002, Microsoft Office Visio 2003, Microsoft Office Visio 2007 | Yes | Yes |

**Note** Use this table as a guideline only. It includes a sample of the most commonly asked-about software.

In cases where the update is offered, Microsoft recommends that customers install the update regardless of whether or not the software accesses the vulnerable code. Installing the update will help to ensure customers are running the most up-to-date version of the VBE6.dll used by Microsoft Office software.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of software constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**I have applied the required Microsoft security updates, but I still have an affected version of the Visual Basic for Applications runtime (VBE6.dll) on my system. How do I update this DLL?**

There are cases where your system might still have an affected version of VBE6.dll even after you have installed the required security updates for Microsoft Office and the update for Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications listed in this bulletin.

If VBE6.dll was installed on your system by a supported version of Microsoft Office, then applying the security update for the affected version of Microsoft Office will replace VBE6.dll with the updated version that addresses the vulnerability described in this bulletin. However, if VBE6.dll was installed on your system by a third-party application, you may have to install an update for that program.

To update VBE6.dll for third-party applications there are two possible scenarios depending on the third-party application's implementation of VBA. If you know that the third-party application is compliant to the recommended best practices for using a shared component as a side-by-side assembly, then applying the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (KB974945) update will replace VBE6.dll in the shared location with the updated version that addresses the vulnerability described in this bulletin.

On the other hand, if the third-party application does not place VBE6.dll in the shared location as per recommended best practices, then you should contact the third-party application developer and ask them to provide you with an updated version of their application that contains a newer version of the VBE6.dll that addresses the vulnerability described in this bulletin. Note that not every third-party application that installs VBE6.dll is vulnerable to the vulnerability described in this bulletin because the application might not use VBE6.dll to search for ActiveX controls in a way that is exploitable. However, only the developer of that application can make that determination.

**This security update only applies to Microsoft software. How can I detect if third-party applications have deployed an affected version of the Visual Basic for Applications runtime (VBE6.dll) on my system?**

Third-party applications that support VBA could deploy VBE6.dll in a location that is not updated by this security update. In the case that you do have a third-party application that has shipped with its own copy of VBE6.dll, to help ensure that your system is fully protected from the vulnerability described in this bulletin, you should contact the developer or vendor responsible for support for the third-party application directly.

For details on how to scan for copies of VBE6.dll on your system, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 978213](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/978213). Scanning for all copies of VBE6.dll on your system can assist in identifying potentially vulnerable copies that may have been installed by third-party applications.

**I am a third-party application developer and I use Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications runtime in my application. Is my application vulnerable and how do I update it?**

Developers who redistribute the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications runtime VBE6.dll should ensure that they update the version of the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications runtime installed with their application by downloading an updated version of the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications SDK from the [Summit Software Company](https://www.summsoft.com/). For more information on best practices on redistributed component use, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 835322](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/835322) and the MSDN article, [Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa375193.aspx).

**I am an ISV. Where is the update for Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications SDK?**

The update is available from the [Summit Software Company](https://www.summsoft.com/). Summit Software Company is a global supplier of application customization software products and integration support services to independent software vendors (ISVs) and corporate developers. In June 1996, Summit Software entered into an agreement with Microsoft to sell Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications and related value-added technology and services. Summit continues to sell and support Microsoft VBA.

**Why is this update Critical for Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications but only Important for Microsoft Office?**

Microsoft Office XP and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**I use Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2007, when users of Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 2. All updates released after April 24, 2009 for Microsoft Office 2007 will include these security features, which were introduced in Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 2. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

## VBE6.dll Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0815

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications searches for ActiveX controls. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a host application opens and passes a specially crafted file to the Visual Basic for Applications runtime. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0815](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0815).

#### Mitigating Factors for VBE6.dll Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0815

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, the 2007 Microsoft Office System prompts a user with a security warning before activating an embedded ActiveX control in an Office document. Users who choose to not enable the control are protected by this default setting. For more information, see the Microsoft Office Online article, [Enable or disable ActiveX controls in Office documents](https://office.microsoft.com/help/ha100310671033.aspx).
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for VBE6.dll Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0815

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable ActiveX controls in the 2007 Microsoft Office System**

  You can disable ActiveX controls in the 2007 Microsoft Office System using the **TrustCenter**. Refer to the instructions for how to "Disable all controls without notification" in the Microsoft Office Online article, [Enable or disable ActiveX controls in Office documents](https://office.microsoft.com/help/ha100310671033.aspx).

  **Impact of workaround.** Embedded ActiveX controls (such as macros) will not run in Office documents.
* **Restrict access to VBE6.dll**

  For Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, enter the following at a command prompt:

  `cacls "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA\VBA6\vbe6.dll" /E /P everyone:N`

  For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, enter the following at an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  takeown /f "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA\VBA6\vbe6.dll"
  icacls "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA\VBA6\vbe6.dll" /save %TEMP%\VBE6_ACL.TXT
  icacls "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA\VBA6\vbe6.dll" /deny everyone:(F)

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Embedded ActiveX controls (such as macros) will not run in Office documents. For instance, users will be unable to insert objects into Office documents.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  For Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, enter the following at a command prompt:

  `cacls "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA\VBA6\vbe6.dll" /E /R everyone`

  For Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, enter the following at a command prompt:

  `icacls "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VBA\VBA6\" /restore %TEMP%\VBE6_ACL.TXT`
* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  [Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:

  [https:](https://)

  To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the office file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the Office file formats:

| Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- | --- |
| ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet | ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8 |
| ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template | ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template |
| ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin | ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |
| ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document | ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8 |
| ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show | ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8 |
| ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template | ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow |
| ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow | ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8 |

**Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, the commands above will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

\*\*How to undo the workaround. \*\*For information on how to undo this workaround, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for VBE6.dll Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0815

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that Visual Basic for Applications searches for ActiveX controls in a document that supports VBA. As a result, it is possible for a host application, such as Microsoft Office or a third-party application developed for Visual Basic programmability, to pass a specially crafted document with embedded ActiveX controls to the VBA runtime creating a condition that could allow arbitrary code to be run.

**What is Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)?**

Microsoft VBA is a development technology for developing client desktop packaged applications and integrating them with existing data and systems. Microsoft VBA is based on the Microsoft Visual Basic development system. Microsoft Office products include VBA and make use of VBA to perform certain functions. VBA can also be used to build customized applications based around an existing host application.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In order for an attack to be successful, a user would have to open a specially crafted document that supports VBA. This document could be any type of document that supports VBA, such as a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or PowerPoint presentation.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted Office file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a document that supports VBA such as an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers where Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications or Microsoft Office is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications searches for ActiveX Controls embedded in documents.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

Alert
# Microsoft Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA10-131A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Outlook Express
* Microsoft Windows Mail
* Microsoft Windows Live Mail
* Microsoft Office
* Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
* third-party software that uses Visual Basic for Applications

### Overview

Microsoft has released updates to address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Outlook Express, Microsoft Windows Mail, Microsoft Windows Live Mail, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications.

Microsoft has released security bulletins for multiple vulnerabilities in Microsoft Outlook Express, Microsoft Windows Mail, Microsoft Windows Live Mail, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. These bulletins are described in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for May 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-may.mspx).

Third-party software that distributes VBE6.DLL may also be affected. If the third-party application follows the best practices for using a shared component as a side-by-side assembly, then the component will be updated by the update provided by [MS10-031](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-031.mspx). Otherwise, you should contact the vendor to obtain an updated version of the application with the fixed VBE6.DLL file.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a vulnerable application to crash.

### Solution

**Apply updates from Microsoft**

Microsoft has provided updates for these vulnerabilities in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for May 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-may.mspx). The security bulletin describes any known issues related to the updates. Administrators are encouraged to note these issues and test for any potentially adverse effects. Administrators should consider using an automated update distribution system such as [Windows Server Update Services](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/updateservices/default.mspx) (WSUS).

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
