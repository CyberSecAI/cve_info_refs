Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0981:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `com_tpjobs` component of Joomla. Specifically, the `id_c` parameter within the `resadvsearch` task is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id_c` parameter. The responses to the queries are not directly displayed, meaning the attacker has to infer the output of their queries through the application's behavior (hence, "blind" SQL injection).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Admin login compromise:** The provided text notes, "Admin login bilgileri alınabilir", which translates to "Admin login information can be obtained." This indicates an attacker could potentially use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract usernames and passwords from the database, allowing them to gain administrative control of the Joomla site.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable Joomla component, specifically targeting the `resadvsearch` task.
- **`id_c[]` parameter:** The SQL injection is performed by manipulating the `id_c[]` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They can perform the attack remotely.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable component:** The attacker needs to know that the `com_tpjobs` component is installed and vulnerable.

**Technical details**
The exploit example shows how an attacker can test for the vulnerability:
- `http://server/index.php?option=com_tpjobs&task=resadvsearch&keyword=&id_c[]=1 and 1=1` (TRUE)
- `http://server/index.php?option=com_tpjobs&task=resadvsearch&keyword=&id_c[]=1 and 1=0` (FALSE)
These URLs will result in different responses, thus confirming the SQLi vulnerability.

The exploit suggests the following vulnerable URL structure:
`path/index.php?option=com_tpjobs&task=resadvsearch&keyword=&id_c[]=[SQL INJ.]`

The exploit also states "Zararlı karakterler filtrelenmelidir", which means "Malicious characters should be filtered" and points to the need of input sanitization as a fix.
