Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `id` parameter in the `com_mochigames` component of Joomla! is vulnerable to SQL injection. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is used in a SQL query.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id` parameter.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
    *   **Data Breach:** Specifically, the provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table, which could lead to a full compromise of the Joomla! website.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Joomla! instance.
    *   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `id` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   **No Authentication Required**: The exploit can be performed without authentication.

*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The vulnerable URL is: `http://[HOST]/[JOOMLA_PATH]/index.php?view=mochigames&id=[SQL]&option=com_mochigames&Itemid=80`
    *   The proof of concept SQL injection is: `99999' union select 1,2,username,4,password,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 from jos_users#`
