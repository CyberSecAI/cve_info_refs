{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter within the viewjokes.php script. Specifically, the script directly includes the 'id' GET parameter in a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete control over the database server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to 'viewjokes.php' with a malicious SQL payload in the 'id' parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the web application. No prior authentication is needed in the exploit."
