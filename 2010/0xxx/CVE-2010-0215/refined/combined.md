## ActiveCollab permissions failure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#236703

Original Release Date: 2010-10-04 | Last Revised: 2010-10-04

---

### Overview

An authenticated user can view and delete projects or files that they are not assigned to.

### Description

| An authenticated user with no permission to a project can subscribe to the project, delete files, and possibly take other actions by loading a specifically crafted URL. Specific fields for the URL would most likely not be known to the attacker but a brute force attack could still be used to try all possibilities. ActiveCollab 2.3.1 is known to be vulnerable. Earlier versions may be vulnerable as well. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated attacker could view or modify projects they are not assigned to, resulting in loss of data integrity and confidentiality. An unauthenticated attacker may use a cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attack to trick an authenticated user into visiting a specifically crafted malicious URL as well. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to ActiveCollab 2.3.2 or newer. |
