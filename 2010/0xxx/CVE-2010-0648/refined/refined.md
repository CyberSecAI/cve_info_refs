The provided content describes a vulnerability in Safari and Google Chrome related to how they handle redirects when accessing the `href` attribute of a `<link>` tag via JavaScript.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the browsers' behavior of returning the final URL after a redirect when accessing the `href` attribute of a `<link>` tag through JavaScript, instead of returning the original URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-  The browsers expose the final redirect URL which may contain sensitive information in the query string like session IDs or CSRF tokens.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially retrieve session IDs, CSRF tokens, or other sensitive information present in the query strings of redirected URLs. This information could then be used for more dangerous attacks.
- An attacker can determine if a user is logged into a website by comparing the original URL with the final redirected URL.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker would need to trick a user into browsing a website controlled by the attacker.
- The attacker's website would contain a `<link>` tag pointing to a URL that redirects, and JavaScript code that accesses the `href` attribute of the link tag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a website or be able to inject malicious code into a webpage that a user might visit.
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to visit their malicious website while the user is logged into a target website.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to be present in Safari and Google Chrome, but not in Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.
- Firefox had a similar bug which was patched in 2008.
- The vulnerability was reportedly fixed in Chrome a couple of weeks after it was disclosed in the provided blog.
- The blog post suggests that websites putting session IDs and tokens in query strings are already insecure, and this vulnerability can assist in exploiting that.
