Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-0546:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A symlink following issue exists in Folder Manager.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is related to how Folder Manager handles symlinks when unmounting disk images or remote shares. A folder named "Cleanup At Startup" is removed upon unmount. If a maliciously crafted volume includes a symlink within this folder, it can cause the deletion of an arbitrary folder with the current user's permissions.
*   **Impact:** Data loss due to the deletion of an arbitrary folder.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious actor can craft a disk image or remote share with a carefully constructed symlink.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create or control a disk image or remote share that is later mounted by a user. They do not need to have elevated privileges, just the ability to create a malicious volume that a user will mount.
* **Affected Systems:** Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.3, Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.3
*   **Mitigation:** The issue is addressed through improved handling of symlinks in Folder Manager.

**Summary**

The vulnerability allows a malicious user to create a disk image with a specifically crafted symlink such that when a user mounts and unmounts it, a targeted folder could be deleted.
