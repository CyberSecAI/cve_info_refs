  "CVE-2010-0290": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Match": true
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "The original fix for CVE-2009-4022 was incomplete, leading to improper DNSSEC validation for certain responses.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper DNSSEC validation",
        "DNS cache poisoning"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could bypass DNSSEC validation and perform a cache poisoning attack. This could lead to misdirected traffic, and denial of service by providing incorrect DNS information.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Crafted responses containing CNAME or DNAME records.",
        "Recursive client queries requesting DNSSEC records but indicating that checking should be disabled."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS responses to the vulnerable server and the target server must be processing recursive client queries that request DNSSEC records, but indicate checking should be disabled.",
      "Affected components": [
         "BIND DNS server"
      ]
    }
  }
