  "CVE-2010-0247": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory access leading to memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted web page and convincing a user to visit that page via clicking a link in email/IM, or by injecting it in compromised websites or advertisements. The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the specially crafted web page.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage that exploits the vulnerability. The attacker doesn't need any other specific capabilities or positions."
