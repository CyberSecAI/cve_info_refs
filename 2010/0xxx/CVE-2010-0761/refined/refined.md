Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw present in the Books/eBooks Rental Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `cat_id` parameter in the `index.php?view=gamecatalog` URL is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including admin credentials (`admin_name`, `admin_password`) as demonstrated in the exploit.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With database access, attackers could potentially modify data, gain control over the application, or escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted GET request to the vulnerable URL, injecting SQL code via the `cat_id` parameter.
- **Direct Web Access:** The exploit targets the application directly through the web interface, without any need for prior access or compromised user accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be aware of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious queries.
- **No Privileged Access Required:** The attacker does not need prior authentication or privileged access to initiate the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` query to extract data from the `rental_admin` table, concatenating the `admin_name` and `admin_password`.
- The provided exploit demonstrates how to bypass normal query execution and extract information from the database.
- The vulnerable software is identified as being available at `http://www.commodityrentals.com/`.

**Summary:**
CVE-2010-0761 describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Books/eBooks Rental Software, which can be exploited by sending a malicious HTTP GET request to the application. The vulnerability allows an attacker to extract sensitive information, such as admin credentials, potentially leading to further system compromise.
