  "CVE-2010-0727": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Description": "A bug in the GFS/GFS2 locking code allows skipping a lock if the sgid bit is set for the file, leading to a denial of service by triggering a BUG() when closing the file with a posix lock on a GFS/GFS2 filesystem.",
    "Root cause": "The GFS/GFS2 locking code incorrectly skips lock removal when the sgid bit is set and a posix lock is in place.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of mandatory locks",
      "Missing posix lock removal",
      "Potential for kernel BUG()"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system crash) due to a kernel BUG() triggered when closing a file with an active posix lock.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to a system with a GFS/GFS2 filesystem. An attacker needs to create a file, set a posix lock, set the file mode to include the sgid bit and then close the file.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to create files and modify their permissions on a GFS/GFS2 filesystem."
