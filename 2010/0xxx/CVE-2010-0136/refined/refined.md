Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-0136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an insufficient enforcement of macro security settings for Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros within OpenOffice.org. This means that when a user opens a document containing a specially crafted VBA macro, the macro's security restrictions could be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Security Enforcement:** OpenOffice.org did not properly enforce macro security settings. The software's security controls failed to prevent the execution of arbitrary macro commands within a document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary macro commands, bypassing security controls. This could lead to a wide range of malicious actions, potentially with the privileges of the user opening the malicious document.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Document:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted document that contains a VBA macro designed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Document:** The attacker must be able to create or modify a document to include a malicious VBA macro.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the target user to open the malicious document.
*   **No Special Network Access**: The attacker does not require any special access to the user network.

**Summary:**

CVE-2010-0136 describes a vulnerability in OpenOffice.org where VBA macro security settings are not properly enforced, potentially allowing an attacker to execute malicious macros by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted document.
