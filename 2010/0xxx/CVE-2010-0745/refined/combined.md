Date: Wed, 10 Mar 2010 18:30:46 +0100

Subject: CVE Request -- Dovecot v1.2.11 -- DoS (excessive CPU use) by processing
 email with huge header

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Dovecot upstream has released latest v1.2.11 version of Dovecot IMAP server:
     [1] <http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2010-March/000152.html>

   addressing one denial of service issue (from upstream announcement):
   "mbox users really should upgrade, because by sending a message with
    a huge header you could basically cause a DoS (this problem exists only
    with v1.2.x, not with v1.0 or v1.1)."

   References:
     [2] <http://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2010-February/047190.html>
     [3] <http://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2010-February/047058.html>
     [4] <http://secunia.com/advisories/38881/>

Could you allocate a CVE id for it?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

mbox users really should upgrade, because by sending a message with a
huge header you could basically cause a DoS (this problem exists only
with v1.2.x, not with v1.0 or v1.1).

	- mbox: Message header reading was unnecessarily slow. Fetching a
	  huge header could have resulted in Dovecot eating a lot of CPU.
	  Also searching messages was much slower than necessary.
	- mbox, dbox, cydir: Mail root directory was created with 0770
	  permissions, instead of 0700.
	- maildir: Reading uidlist could have ended up in an infinite loop.
	- IMAP IDLE: v1.2.7+ caused extra load by checking changes every
	  0.5 seconds after a change had occurred in mailbox

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Tomás Touceda (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2010-04-10 15:31:05 UTC  ``` This problem is only present with versions 1.2.x and it's fixed in 1.2.11:  - mbox: Message header reading was unnecessarily slow. Fetching a   huge header could have resulted in Dovecot eating a lot of CPU.   Also searching messages was much slower than necessary. - mbox, dbox, cydir: Mail root directory was created with 0770   permissions, instead of 0700. - maildir: Reading uidlist could have ended up in an infinite loop. - IMAP IDLE: v1.2.7+ caused extra load by checking changes every   0.5 seconds after a change had occurred in mailbox  Is it ok for version 1.2.11 to go stable? ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Eray Aslan   gentoo-dev  2010-04-10 17:16:20 UTC  ``` dovecot-1.2.11-r1 is ready for stable.  Only concern is it was committed to the tree on April 7th and this is a minor issue.  Advice is welcome on gentoo policy whether this warrents foregoing "30 days before stabilization".  Patrick? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Jeremy Olexa (darkside) (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2010-04-14 04:50:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=314533#c1))  > Advice is welcome on gentoo policy whether this warrents foregoing "30 days > before stabilization".

It happens when I try open mail folder with this buggy message.

Our setup:
-- slackware 11.0, x86_32

Details:
1. Buggy message 1219733 byte size. And most of this size is mail header.

2. Mail header mostly consists of a repeating block:

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dovecot12
Huge mail headers could cause dovecot to consume excessive amounts of CPU
cycles. (CVE-2010-0745)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- cacti
Missing input sanitation in the template export feature allowed for SQL
injection attacks (CVE-2010-1431).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
java-1\_6\_0-openjdk version 1.7.3 fixes serveral security issues:
- CVE-2010-0837: JAR 'unpack200' must verify input parameters
- CVE-2010-0845: No ClassCastException for HashAttributeSet constructors
if run with -Xcomp
- CVE-2010-0838: CMM readMabCurveData Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
- CVE-2010-0082: Loader-constraint table allows arrays instead of only
the base-classes
- CVE-2010-0095: Subclasses of InetAddress may incorrectly interpret
network addresses
- CVE-2010-0085: File TOCTOU deserialization vulnerability
- CVE-2010-0091: Unsigned applet can retrieve the dragged information
before drop action occurs
- CVE-2010-0088: Inflater/Deflater clone issues
- CVE-2010-0084: Policy/PolicyFile leak dynamic ProtectionDomains.
- CVE-2010-0092: AtomicReferenceArray causes SIGSEGV->SEGV\_MAPERR error
- CVE-2010-0094: Deserialization of RMIConnectionImpl objects should
enforce stricter checks
- CVE-2010-0093: System.arraycopy unable to reference elements beyond
Integer.MAX\_VALUE bytes
- CVE-2010-0840: Applet Trusted Methods Chaining Privilege Escalation
Vulnerability
- CVE-2010-0848: AWT Library Invalid Index Vulnerability
- CVE-2010-0847: ImagingLib arbitrary code execution vulnerability
- CVE-2009-3555: TLS: MITM attacks via session renegotiation
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- irssi
irssi did not check the identity information of a remote hosts's certi-
ficate. Attackers could exploit that for a man-in-the-middle attack
(CVE-2010-1155).
irssi could crash if someone changed nick while the victim was leaving
the channel (CVE-2010-1156).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- tar
A malicious remote tape server could cause a buffer overflow in tar.
In order to exploit that an attacker would have to trick the victim
to extract a file that causes tar to open a connection to the rmt
server (CVE-2010-0624). It's advisable to always use tar's
--force-local local option to avoid such tricks.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- fuse
This update adds additional improvements to avoid a race condition in
fusermount that allowed users to umount any filesystem (related to
CVE-2009-3297). Thanks to Al Viro who found it.
Additionally a race condition in fusermount was fixed that allowed non-
privileged users to umount any file system (CVE-2010-0789).
Note: this is a re-release of the previous update with a better patch.
SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2
Integer overflows in libapr could potentially be exploited to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-2412).
Specially crafted XML documents cause apache to consume large amounts
of memory (CVE-2009-1955).
Affected Products: SLES9
- libmysqlclient-devel
This update fixes several security issues in mysql:
- checking server certificates (CVE-2009-4028)
- error handling in subqueries (CVE-2009-4019)
- preserving null\_value flag in GeomFromWKB (CVE-2009-4019)
- symlink behavior fixed (CVE-2008-7247)
- symlink behavior refixed (CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cpio
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that can happen
while expanding specially-crafted archive files (CVE-2010-0624).
It also contains changes for:
- fixed Dat160 Tape Drive density information (bnc#415166)
- fixed cpio issues with file sizes >= 2^32
- fixed handling eof and eod marks (bnc#371077)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- moodle
Moodle version 1.9.8 fixes several security issues including
cross-site-scripting (XSS) and SQL injection bugs (CVE-2010-1613,
CVE-2010-1614, CVE-2010-1615, CVE-2010-1616, CVE-2010-1617
CVE-2010-1618, CVE-2010-1619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- libmikmod
Specially crafted "Impulse Tracker" and "Ultratracker" files could cause a
heap based buffer overflow in libmikmod. Attackers could exploit that to
crash or potentially execute code in applications linking against libmikmod
(CVE-2009-3995, CVE-2009-3996).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libicecore
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs that

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
