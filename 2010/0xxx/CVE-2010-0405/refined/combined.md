## CVE-2010-0405: bzip2 Integer Overflow

[with one comment](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/cve-2010-0405-bzip2-integer-overflow/#comments)

As we can read at [Ubuntu’s USN-986-1 security advisory](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-986-1), the popular [libbz2](http://www.bzip.org/) open source [bzip2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2) implementation is vulnerable in to an integer overflow vulnerability. So, first of all from the CHANGES file of the 1.0.6 version we can read that this vulnerability was reported by Mikolaj Izdebski and we can also notice the buggy code which resides in decompress.c source code file. Specifically, here is the code snippet that demonstrates the bug:

```

Int32 BZ2_decompress ( DState* s )
{
   UChar      uc;
   Int32      retVal;
   Int32      minLen, maxLen;
   bz_stream* strm = s->strm;
        ...
   Int32  es;
   Int32  N;
        ...
   /*restore from the save area*/
        ...
   es          = s->save_es;
   N           = s->save_N;
        ...
      while (True) {

         if (nextSym == EOB) break;

         if (nextSym == BZ_RUNA || nextSym == BZ_RUNB) {

            es = -1;
            N = 1;
            do {
               if (nextSym == BZ_RUNA) es = es + (0+1) * N; else
               if (nextSym == BZ_RUNB) es = es + (1+1) * N;
               N = N * 2;
               GET_MTF_VAL(BZ_X_MTF_3, BZ_X_MTF_4, nextSym);
            }
               while (nextSym == BZ_RUNA || nextSym == BZ_RUNB);

            es++;
            uc = s->seqToUnseq[ s->mtfa[s->mtfbase[0]] ];
            s->unzftab[uc] += es;

```

First of all, you can see that both variables ‘es’ and ‘N’ are 32-bit long signed integers. Now, the ‘DState’ pointer ‘s’ points to the save area in the main decompress code as we can read in its definition at bzlib\_private.h header file. Next, moving to the code we can read that if the next symbol is the End-of-Block (aka. EOB), it will break of the loop; otherwise, it will check if the next ones value is set to ‘RUNA’ or ‘RUNB’ (these two constants are special values used by the run-length encoding to represent the run-length as a binary number greater than one). If this is the case, it will start calculating the ‘es’ and ‘N’ values and execute the [MTF (Move to Front)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move-to-front_transform) transform to the symbol.

As Mikolaj Izdebski noticed, the ‘N’ value can result in overflowing the ‘es’ signed integer during the multiplication and thus leading to an integer overflow. To fix this, the following code was used:

```

             do {
+               /* Check that N doesn't get too big, so that es doesn't
+                  go negative.  The maximum value that can be
+                  RUNA/RUNB encoded is equal to the block size (post
+                  the initial RLE), viz, 900k, so bounding N at 2
+                  million should guard against overflow without
+                  rejecting any legitimate inputs. */
+               if (N >= 2*1024*1024) RETURN(BZ_DATA_ERROR);
                if (nextSym == BZ_RUNA) es = es + (0+1) * N; else
                if (nextSym == BZ_RUNB) es = es + (1+1) * N;

```

Which limits the ‘N’ value to 2097152 to avoid the overflow. After a couple of lines in the same function you can read the following code…

```

      /*-- Set up cftab to facilitate generation of T^(-1) --*/
      s->cftab[0] = 0;
      for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) s->cftab[i] = s->unzftab[i-1];
      for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) s->cftab[i] += s->cftab[i-1];
      for (i = 0; i <= 256; i++) {
         if (s->cftab[i] < 0 || s->cftab[i] > nblock) {
            /* s->cftab[i] can legitimately be == nblock */
            RETURN(BZ_DATA_ERROR);
         }
      }

      s->state_out_len = 0;
      s->state_out_ch  = 0;
      BZ_INITIALISE_CRC ( s->calculatedBlockCRC );
      s->state = BZ_X_OUTPUT;
      if (s->verbosity >= 2) VPrintf0 ( "rt+rld" );

      if (s->smallDecompress) {

         /*-- Make a copy of cftab, used in generation of T --*/
         for (i = 0; i <= 256; i++) s->cftabCopy[i] = s->cftab[i];

```

As you can see in the initial code snippet, the possibly negative ‘es’ value is used to update the ‘s->unzftab[uc]’ value which would lead to initializing a ‘s->cftab[]’ value with an incorrect negative integer in the first ‘for’ loop of the above code. To avoid this, another check was added here too like this:

```

       /*-- Set up cftab to facilitate generation of T^(-1) --*/
+      /* Check: unzftab entries in range. */
+      for (i = 0; i <= 255; i++) {
+         if (s->unzftab[i] < 0 || s->unzftab[i] > nblock)
+            RETURN(BZ_DATA_ERROR);
+      }
+      /* Actually generate cftab. */
       s->cftab[0] = 0;
       for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) s->cftab[i] = s->unzftab[i-1];
       for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) s->cftab[i] += s->cftab[i-1];
+      /* Check: cftab entries in range. */
       for (i = 0; i <= 256; i++) {
          if (s->cftab[i] < 0 || s->cftab[i] > nblock) {

```

The newly added ‘for’ loop checks that the 255 values of the ‘s->unzftab[]’ array aren’t either negative or greater than the block size (stored in ‘nblock’ variable). At last, another check was placed before the code that makes a copy of the ‘cftab’ as you can read above to avoid any read out-of-bounds situation.

```

       }
+      /* Check: cftab entries non-descending. */
+      for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) {
+         if (s->cftab[i-1] > s->cftab[i]) {
+            RETURN(BZ_DATA_ERROR);
+         }
+      }

       s->state_out_len = 0;

```

## CVE-2010-0405: bzip2 Integer Overflow

[with one comment](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/cve-2010-0405-bzip2-integer-overflow/#comments)

As we can read at [Ubuntu’s USN-986-1 security advisory](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-986-1), the popular [libbz2](http://www.bzip.org/) open source [bzip2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2) implementation is vulnerable in to an integer overflow vulnerability. So, first of all from the CHANGES file of the 1.0.6 version we can read that this vulnerability was reported by Mikolaj Izdebski and we can also notice the buggy code which resides in decompress.c source code file. Specifically, here is the code snippet that demonstrates the bug:

```

Int32 BZ2_decompress ( DState* s )
{
   UChar      uc;
   Int32      retVal;
   Int32      minLen, maxLen;
   bz_stream* strm = s->strm;
        ...
   Int32  es;
   Int32  N;
        ...
   /*restore from the save area*/
        ...
   es          = s->save_es;
   N           = s->save_N;
        ...
      while (True) {

         if (nextSym == EOB) break;

         if (nextSym == BZ_RUNA || nextSym == BZ_RUNB) {

            es = -1;
            N = 1;
            do {
               if (nextSym == BZ_RUNA) es = es + (0+1) * N; else
               if (nextSym == BZ_RUNB) es = es + (1+1) * N;
               N = N * 2;
               GET_MTF_VAL(BZ_X_MTF_3, BZ_X_MTF_4, nextSym);
            }
               while (nextSym == BZ_RUNA || nextSym == BZ_RUNB);

            es++;
            uc = s->seqToUnseq[ s->mtfa[s->mtfbase[0]] ];
            s->unzftab[uc] += es;

```

First of all, you can see that both variables ‘es’ and ‘N’ are 32-bit long signed integers. Now, the ‘DState’ pointer ‘s’ points to the save area in the main decompress code as we can read in its definition at bzlib\_private.h header file. Next, moving to the code we can read that if the next symbol is the End-of-Block (aka. EOB), it will break of the loop; otherwise, it will check if the next ones value is set to ‘RUNA’ or ‘RUNB’ (these two constants are special values used by the run-length encoding to represent the run-length as a binary number greater than one). If this is the case, it will start calculating the ‘es’ and ‘N’ values and execute the [MTF (Move to Front)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move-to-front_transform) transform to the symbol.

As Mikolaj Izdebski noticed, the ‘N’ value can result in overflowing the ‘es’ signed integer during the multiplication and thus leading to an integer overflow. To fix this, the following code was used:

```

             do {
+               /* Check that N doesn't get too big, so that es doesn't
+                  go negative.  The maximum value that can be
+                  RUNA/RUNB encoded is equal to the block size (post
+                  the initial RLE), viz, 900k, so bounding N at 2
+                  million should guard against overflow without
+                  rejecting any legitimate inputs. */
+               if (N >= 2*1024*1024) RETURN(BZ_DATA_ERROR);
                if (nextSym == BZ_RUNA) es = es + (0+1) * N; else
                if (nextSym == BZ_RUNB) es = es + (1+1) * N;

```

Which limits the ‘N’ value to 2097152 to avoid the overflow. After a couple of lines in the same function you can read the following code…

```

      /*-- Set up cftab to facilitate generation of T^(-1) --*/
      s->cftab[0] = 0;
      for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) s->cftab[i] = s->unzftab[i-1];
      for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) s->cftab[i] += s->cftab[i-1];
      for (i = 0; i <= 256; i++) {
         if (s->cftab[i] < 0 || s->cftab[i] > nblock) {
            /* s->cftab[i] can legitimately be == nblock */
            RETURN(BZ_DATA_ERROR);
         }
      }

      s->state_out_len = 0;
      s->state_out_ch  = 0;
      BZ_INITIALISE_CRC ( s->calculatedBlockCRC );
      s->state = BZ_X_OUTPUT;
      if (s->verbosity >= 2) VPrintf0 ( "rt+rld" );

      if (s->smallDecompress) {

         /*-- Make a copy of cftab, used in generation of T --*/
         for (i = 0; i <= 256; i++) s->cftabCopy[i] = s->cftab[i];

```

As you can see in the initial code snippet, the possibly negative ‘es’ value is used to update the ‘s->unzftab[uc]’ value which would lead to initializing a ‘s->cftab[]’ value with an incorrect negative integer in the first ‘for’ loop of the above code. To avoid this, another check was added here too like this:

```

       /*-- Set up cftab to facilitate generation of T^(-1) --*/
+      /* Check: unzftab entries in range. */
+      for (i = 0; i <= 255; i++) {
+         if (s->unzftab[i] < 0 || s->unzftab[i] > nblock)
+            RETURN(BZ_DATA_ERROR);
+      }
+      /* Actually generate cftab. */
       s->cftab[0] = 0;
       for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) s->cftab[i] = s->unzftab[i-1];
       for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) s->cftab[i] += s->cftab[i-1];
+      /* Check: cftab entries in range. */
       for (i = 0; i <= 256; i++) {
          if (s->cftab[i] < 0 || s->cftab[i] > nblock) {

```

The newly added ‘for’ loop checks that the 255 values of the ‘s->unzftab[]’ array aren’t either negative or greater than the block size (stored in ‘nblock’ variable). At last, another check was placed before the code that makes a copy of the ‘cftab’ as you can read above to avoid any read out-of-bounds situation.

```

       }
+      /* Check: cftab entries non-descending. */
+      for (i = 1; i <= 256; i++) {
+         if (s->cftab[i-1] > s->cftab[i]) {
+            RETURN(BZ_DATA_ERROR);
+         }
+      }

       s->state_out_len = 0;

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-986-3: dpkg vulnerability

20 September 2010

dpkg could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [dpkg](/security/cves?package=dpkg) - package maintenance system for Debian

## Details

USN-986-1 fixed vulnerabilities in bzip2. dpkg statically links against libbz2

and needed to be rebuilt to use the updated libbz2.

Original advisory details:

An integer overflow was discovered in bzip2. If a user or automated system

were tricked into decompressing a crafted bz2 file, an attacker could cause

bzip2 or any application linked against libbz2 to crash or possibly execute

code as the user running the program.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- samba
A buffer overflow in the sid\_parse() function of samba could
potentially be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code (CVE-2010-3069).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- libgdiplus0
Specially crafted tiff, jpeg and bmp images could cause integer overflows in
ligdiplus0 (CVE-2010-1526).
- libwebkit
The browser engine libwebkit was updated to version 1.2.4 to fix
several security bugs.
(CVE-2010-1781, CVE-2010-1782, CVE-2010-1784, CVE-2010-1785
CVE-2010-1786, CVE-2010-1787, CVE-2010-1788, CVE-2010-1790
CVE-2010-1792, CVE-2010-1793, CVE-2010-2648)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- bzip2
Specially crafted bz2 archives could cause a denial of service or
potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code in applications
that try to unpack such archives (CVE-2010-0405).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- php5
PHP was updated to version 5.2.14 to fix several security issues
(CVE-2010-1860, CVE-2010-1862, CVE-2010-1864, CVE-2010-1914,

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# bzip2

The bzip2 file compression program was developed by Julian Seward and launched on the 18th of July in 1996. It has remained an open source program, available to all for free, for over twenty two years now. The last stable release was seven years ago. The version 1.0.6 was released on the 20th of September in 2010. bzip2 compression program is based on Burrows–Wheeler algorithm. The program can compress files but cannot archive them. Julian Seward is still in charge of maintaining the program. The compression application works on all major operating systems and is available as a BSD-like license. The program uses .bz2 as its filename extension, application/x-bzip2 as the media type on internet and public.archive.bzip2 as the uniform type identifier.

bzip2 is suitable for power users. The command line enabled file compression program has fifteen options. Initiating and running the program is a cakewalk. Every option is well explained. The program can be used in batch files. It cannot recover from syntax errors but it can force compression and even decompress damaged archives. There are specific options to overwrite files, to suppress errors and compel compression. The simple operation and quick decompression or extraction would suit many heavy users. As per the information published by the developer, the file compression program is capable of compressing files down to 15% or 10% of other available techniques and operates at twice the compression speed and six times the decompression speed than gzip. Although not an archiving tool, the program can extract undamaged files in disks or tapes that have errors.

The file compression program can be downloaded and installed for free. It is compatible with Windows 2000 and XP, subsequently all later versions. There are no specific requirements or additional specifications that must be satiated. The total size of the file to be downloaded is 76KB. You would use the bzip2-105-x86-win32.exe file to install. bzip2 is used by a few million people around the world. bzip2 file compression can convert almost everything that you may test it with. The simplicity and reliability of the program have earned it many laurels but there has been some criticism for its lack of archiving ability. The efficacy of the program to extract some damaged parts of files in otherwise inaccessible tapes or discs is worthwhile. This blog was created as an informational portal on bzip2. Scott Chow has [a good guide on how to start a blog](https://www.theblogstarter.com) that is suitable for beginners if you are looking to start your own blog on file compression or any other topic.

There has been no major update to the file compression program in recent years. This is partly because such updates have been unnecessary. It can still work on all popular files and can compress or decompress with utmost ease. The space you can save with files compressed using bzip2 is sufficient when you factor in heavy documents or materials. There is no premium version of the file compression program so you can bid adieu to the recurrent messages prompting you to pay up and upgrade. There is no advanced or full version. You get everything there is in the free and open source version of bzip2. In fact, there is only one version you can download and use. It has been criticized by some for having only one algorithm powering the compression.

**Comprehensive Guide to bzip2**

bzip2 became quite popular in the late nineties and the subsequent updates made it more widespread. The program is more effective than Deflate and LZW programs but is also slower. The LZW or .z and the Deflate algorithms such as .gz and .zip are less effective but they operate quickly. As a result they end up taking more space than what bzip2 can achieve. The bzip2 compression program facilitates considerably faster decompression compared to its pace of compression.

bzip2 file compression program works on data in different sizes of blocks, usually from 100 to 900 kilobytes. It relies on Burrows–Wheeler transform or algorithm to convert all character sequences recurring frequently into identical letters strings. The program then uses the Huffman coding move to front transform. bzip, which was the predecessor of bzip2, employed arithmetic coding but the successor uses Huffman coding. The performance of bzip2 is asymmetric. It has a relatively fast decompression. For a while in the early years of the century, the program did factor in the scope of multi threading and it was aimed at linear speed enhancements on multi core or multi cpu computers but this functionality has not been made available in subsequent versions released by the developer.

bzip2 is similar to gzip. Both are data compressors. bzip2 is not like zip or tar. Those have archiving ability. bzip2 is also only meant for single files. It cannot work on multiple files, archive splitting or encryption. It can work with external utilities like GnuPG and tar to facilitate such tasks. In a way, bzip2 stays true to its UNIX tradition.

bzip2 employs a compression stack technique that involves several layers atop one another and then the decompression follows a reverse order. The program carries out run length encoding of the initial data, applies the Burrows–Wheeler algorithm which is also known as block sorting, goes for the move to front transform and runs run length encoding of the MTF outcome, then applies the Huffman coding before selecting from different tables and using a unary base 1 encoding of the selected table, subsequently delta encoding of the code bit lengths and sparse bit array, which shows the used symbols.

There is no formal file format or specification but a reverse engineered informal spec is used. There is a four byte header for every .bz2 stream with none or some compressed blocks and a marker at the end of the stream that has a thirty two bit CRC. The signature or magic number of bzip2 is BZh. Many programs support the bzip2 file compression format including 7-Zip, micro-bzip2, Pbzip2, bzip2smp, smpbzip2, pyflate, bz2, Arnaud Bouchez’s bzip, lbzip2, mpibzip2, Apache Commons, jbzip2, DotNetZip and DotNetCompression.

**Technical Overview of bzip2**

The initial run length encoding has a sequence of four to two hundred and fifty five duplicate symbols. The consecutive sequence is then replaced by four symbols with a repeat length varying from zero to two hundred and fifty one. For instance, AAAAAAABBBBCCCD sequence gets replaced by AAAA\3BBBB\0CCCD. The 3 and 0 are byte values. The symbols are transformed only after the first four symbols so the run length is zero and the transformation is reversible. bzip2 can cause an expansion of a file in worst case scenarios but up to 1.25. In best case scenarios, the reduction is less than 0.02. This run length encoding has been criticized and even Julian Seward had admitted that it was a mistake and was only applicable to avert pathological instances.

The Burrows–Wheeler algorithm is at the crux of the file compression program. It is the main block sort that determines reversibility. This block is self contained and both input & output buffers do not undergo any changes in size. The limit at this stage is preset at nine hundred kilobytes and it does not change. The move to front transform during the file compression also remains completely distant in terms of its impact on the size. There is no change to the processed block. The symbols are used in an array. Every replaced symbol during processing has a location or index as an integral part of the array. Since identical characters or symbols that recur immediately are replaced with zero symbols, the program can maintain a low range of integers and this simplifies the encoding. Any legacy method of compression can work on the data that is transformed using this system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-27 09:39:39 UTC  ``` A bzip2 security issue was reported to Debian security team:    Mikołaj Izdebski has discovered an integer overflow flaw in the   [BZ2](show_bug.cgi?id=2 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - broken links of default index.html")_decompress function in bzip2/libbz2. An attacker could use a   crafted [bz2](show_bug.cgi?id=2 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - broken links of default index.html") file to cause a denial of service (application crash) or   potentially to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2010-0405](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0405))   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-08-27 09:40:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 441451](attachment.cgi?id=441451&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=441451&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-20 09:23:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 448401](attachment.cgi?id=448401&action=diff "bzip2 1.0.5 -> 1.0.6 diff") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=448401&action=edit "bzip2 1.0.5 -> 1.0.6 diff") bzip2 1.0.5 -> 1.0.6 diff  Fix added in bzip2 1.0.6 additional extra sanity checks compared to previously proposed patch.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-20 09:24:57 UTC  ``` Public now via bzip2 1.0.6 release.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-20 14:41:56 UTC  ``` CCing clamav maintainers, clamav contains embedded copy of bzip code in libclamav/nsis/bzlib.c .   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-09-21 01:08:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0703 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0703.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-21 14:44:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c9)) > CCing clamav maintainers, clamav contains embedded copy of bzip code in > libclamav/nsis/bzlib.c .  This is now fixed in clamav upstream version 0.96.3.  Upstream commit:  <http://git.clamav.net/gitweb?p=clamav-devel.git;a=commitdiff;h=fcd8091474d12592d509adcfd0bdd0b0dc8835f5#patch4>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c13)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-21 16:14:39 UTC  ``` Clamav shouldn't need to be updated because of this.  libclamav uses libbz2, and there are buildrequires on bzip2-devel so it should not be using it's internal bzip2 copy at all.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-21 18:52:41 UTC  ``` I admit I may be wrong here, or confused by a report mentioning this embedded bzip code copy in clamav.  Looking at the build.log, libclamav/nsis/bzlib.c is compiled when building Fedora clamav packages and does not contain any #ifdefs to wrap system libbz2.  libclamav links system libbz2 and does use it to decompress [bz2](show_bug.cgi?id=2 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - broken links of default index.html") files.  nsis/bzlib.c only seems to be used by nsis (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) unpacker.  Corrections welcome.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c15)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-21 20:10:21 UTC  ``` Sorry, looks like you may be right after all.  I'm not sure why it links to libbz2 and also contains this bzlib.c.  At any rate, yes, clamav should be updated to correct this as it does not look as though the system libbz2 changes will have any impact there.  Sorry for adding to the confusion.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-10 18:59:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2010:0858 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0858.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=627882#c17)  J.Kratochvil    2010-11-11 11:19:10 UTC  ``` I think it's time to move the patch from Fedora 12 updates-testing repository to Fedora 12 updates repository. Updates-testing repository is not enabled by default, so I suppose that a lot of Fedora 12 users are still affected by this security problem.   ``` |  |

# USN-986-2: ClamAV vulnerability

20 September 2010

ClamAV could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)

## Packages

* [clamav](/security/cves?package=clamav) - anti-virus utility for Unix

## Details

USN-986-1 fixed a vulnerability in bzip2. This update provides the

corresponding update for ClamAV.

Original advisory details:

An integer overflow was discovered in bzip2. If a user or automated system

were tricked into decompressing a crafted bz2 file, an attacker could cause

bzip2 or any application linked against libbz2 to crash or possibly execute

code as the user running the program.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [libclamav6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/clamav)
  -
  [0.95.3+dfsg-1ubuntu0.09.10.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/clamav/0.95.3%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu0.09.10.3)

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [libclamav6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/clamav)
  -
  [0.95.3+dfsg-1ubuntu0.09.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/clamav/0.95.3%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu0.09.04.3)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libclamav6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/clamav)
  -

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# USN-986-1: bzip2 vulnerability

20 September 2010

bzip2 could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [bzip2](/security/cves?package=bzip2) - high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in bzip2. If a user or automated system

were tricked into decompressing a crafted bz2 file, an attacker could cause

bzip2 or any application linked against libbz2 to crash or possibly execute

code as the user running the program.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [BSidesBUD 2023: A Deeper Look at the Disrupted Bot Farms in Ukraine](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/02/bsidesbud-2023-a-deeper-look-at-the-disrupted-bot-farms-in-ukraine/)

It would probably take us many years to look into all the intricate details of the countless cyber operations that are taking place globally in relation to the Ukraine/Russia conflict the last couple of years. As a tiny step towards that direction, in 2023 I did some research on how Russian intelligence services have been setting up and utilising “bot farms” inside Ukraine.

Eventually, I was accepted to present this research at BSidesBUD 2023. A really nice event at the capital of Hungary that I’d definitely recommend to everyone from our industry.

In case you want to get an idea of the content, below I’m attaching the slides that I used. However, the slides were mostly to support my presentation so they do not have that much value on their own. Nevertheless, it was a subject that I hadn’t come across in any security conference before, so I thought it’s worth documenting for future reference.

## [Kaspersky SAS ’23](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/kaspersky-sas-23/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/kaspersky-sas-23/#respond)

I’m always seeking to learn and experience different cyber security events since each one of them gives you a different perspective of our industry (and the world), and Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS), was in my “*to do*” list for a long time.

I planned to attend SAS in 2018-2019 but due to some competing priorities, I couldn’t. Then, in 2020 I applied to do a presentation titled “cyber-crime ecosystem in the travel industry” which was accepted, but the conference was cancelled due to the pandemic, and in 2023 it was the first time since the pandemic that SAS was back. So, after 5 years, I finally managed to attend the SAS ’23 which took place in Phuket, Thailand and was a wonderful, small, security conference.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1.png?w=1024)

It was a relatively small event with a couple of hundred of people or so. But the content was incredible. From all sorts of APTs that you rarely hear about, to innovative research, and of course having the ability network and chat with professionals from national CERTs as well as security researchers from countries rarely present in the well-known US and European cyber security events, with a truly amazing organisation, lots of activities and surprises.

As security professionals it’s imperative that we understand the threat landscape globally, and this event was a remarkable place to gain that insight for anyone coming from US or EU background. Both from the defenders and the attackers’ perspective, the event included very interesting TTPs and content that I hadn’t seen before.

Lastly, as Eugene Kaspersky put it in one of the conference activities, a great security conference needs to have: 1) new and innovative security research/content; 2) be hosted in a nice environment/location that allows people to disconnect from their day-to-day work; and 3) be fun. SAS ’23 managed to cover all three areas successfully.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sas23.jpg?w=1024)

It’s hard to choose my favourite talks from this event, but if I had to pick 5 (in no particular order), based on the knowledge I acquired from them, those would be:

* **StripedFly: Traversing the Blue Expanse in Search of Eternal Wonders**
  + by Sergey Belov and Sergey Lozhkin (Kaspersky GReAT)
* **How Many Gates to the Temple of Space? Shapes of Tunnels Drilled by Desecrators**
  + by Askar Dyussekeyev (KZ-CERT)
* **Unearthing TetrisPhantom: Discovering secrets of an intricate cyber threat campaign**
  + by Noushin Shabab (Kaspersky GReAT)
* **Operation Triangulation: Сonnecting the Dots**
  + by Igor Kuznetsov (Kaspersky)
* **Space Pirates: raiders of privacy**
  + by Denis Kuvshinov (Positive Technologies)

## [2022 CTI-EU Talk: Threat Landscape and Defences Against Mobile Surveillance Implants](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/2022-cti-eu-talk-threat-landscape-and-defences-against-mobile-surveillance-implants/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/2022-cti-eu-talk-threat-landscape-and-defences-against-mobile-surveillance-implants/#respond)

In December 2022 I had a very pleasant surprise, I was given an opportunity to give a lightning talk at the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) conference of 2022, known as **CTI-EU 2022**. I had attended previous editions of this event and it was an amazing experience, so having that opportunity was a great honour.

I had a few different topics that I was researching around that time and after a small discussion with the organisers we agreed that the best option would be the “Threat Landscape and Defences Against Mobile Surveillance Implants”.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.png?w=800)

If you’d like to see what other presentations took place during the CTI-EU 2022, check out the [published agenda](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2022-cti-eu-conference-1/enisa-cti-eu-conference-agenda.pdf) for the event. There were some very valuable presentations, but of course, being an on-site event, the most important part was the face-to-face interactions. With this event ENISA manages to bring public and private sector CTI experts together and we had numerous fruitful conversations ranging from CTI topics, to public/private sector collaborations, challenges, and more.

I’m not sure if/when ENISA will publish the slides from the TLP:WHITE talks, but if you’d like to see mine you can get them here. Apparently, being a lightning talk I couldn’t go in-depth in almost anything, but if you are interested in something mentioned in my slides (but with more depth), please contact me. Additionally, if you are researching this space and would like a second pair of eyes, I’d be more than happy to help.

## [OSINT: A Summary of SIDEWINDER Operations in 2022](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/osint-a-summary-of-sidewinder-operations-in-2022/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/osint-a-summary-of-sidewinder-operations-in-2022/#respond)

SIDEWINDER (also known as RAZOR TIGER, RATTLESNAKE, T-APT-04, HARDCORE NATIONALIST, and APT-C-17) is a cyber espionage actor who has been active at least since 2012. I had a look on all the publicly known 2022 operations (that I could find) attributed to this actor to derive some insights and here’s the outcome.

The main outcome we can derive is that SIDEWINDER is focusing mainly on Pakistani military targets (particularly the Navy) to conduct cyber espionage.

In terms of the data I used, through publicly available information I found 40 unique events (let’s call them operations) for the period of January 2022-December 2022 and here are some statistics…

**Note**: Apparently this is a tiny number compared to [Kaspersky’s](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/sidewinder-hackers-launched-over-1000.html) “*over 1,000 new attacks since April 2020*” but I tried to keep it limited to 2022, publicly available reports, and only those that had some context. Not just IOCs.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_target_countries.jpg?w=851)

*Figure 1: Countries targeted by SIDEWINDER*

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_targeted_sectors.jpg?w=769)

*Figure 2: Sectors targeted by SIDEWINDER*

Many identify SIDEWINDER as an Indian cyber espionage actor and based on the targets of *Figure 1* and *Figure 2* I’d say that we can safely assume that their main target is Pakistani military entities which makes this actor better aligned with what a military intelligence agency would be performing. Maybe something like India’s [Directorate of Military Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Military_Intelligence_%28India%29)? Apparently, there are no hard evidence here to be certain about this, just some food for thought.

Considering the main target is the Pakistani military, here’s a breakdown of the specific SIDEWINDER targets in Pakistan from the limited 2022 dataset I mentioned in the introduction.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_breakdown_of_pakistani_targets.jpg?w=976)

*Figure 3: Volumetric analysis of top SIDEWINDER targets in Pakistan*

Based on that limited dataset, clearly the Pakistani Navy was by far the top target of SIDEWINDER for 2022, strengthening the hypothesis of SIDEWINDER being an actor associated with India’s military intelligence, or even naval intelligence.

With such small sample sets, timelines aren’t particularly valuable but I know that people will be asking for it so here is a timeline analysis too.

## [BSides Cyprus: Cloud… Just somebody else’s computer](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/bsides-cyprus-cloud-just-somebody-elses-computer/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/bsides-cyprus-cloud-just-somebody-elses-computer/#respond)

Just noticed that I haven’t published much for the last few talks I’ve been giving and this is one of them…

That was my 8th, and last, talk for 2021. It was a research more on the cloud security architect/engineering side. That was my second time participating in [BSides Cyprus](https://twitter.com/BsidesCyprus), and as always, it was an amazing event with amazing people. The organizers of BSides Cyprus did a remarkable job. From the set up of the remote event, to the CTF, the prizes for the CTF participants, and the overall atmosphere, it was an excellent event.

Now specifically on my talk, that was a subject that I was preparing for around a year and I’m glad I got to talk about it in BSides Cyprus. For various reasons, public cloud providers are intentionally abstracting lots of the plumbing on how everything is put together and how does this affect security.

So, in this talk I picked up a few services from AWS, GCP, and Azure and dissected them to demonstrate that:

* It’s just computers and software under the hood
* How having this “inner” architectural understanding helps you uncover vulnerabilities (using some publicly available ones in the examples, no 0days or embargoed issues revealed)

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bsidescyprus21.jpg?w=1024)

My goal with this talk wasn’t to uncover some significant design flaw or claim that public cloud is bad. Just to raise awareness and change the mindset of security engineers when working with public cloud to think beyond what the vendor’s documentation says. If you’d like to have a look, you can find my [slides here](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cloud...-just-somebody-elses-computer.pdf).
