```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to sanitize user input provided through the 'id' parameter in the 'news.php' file, leading to SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the 'news.php' file of Ero Auktion 2010 and Ero Auktion 2.0.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration (e.g., user credentials) or other malicious actions on the database.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable 'news.php' endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the 'id' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
