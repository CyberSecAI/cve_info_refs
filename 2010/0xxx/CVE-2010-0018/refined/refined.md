  "CVE-2010-0018": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Windows Embedded OpenType (EOT) Font Engine decompresses specially crafted EOT fonts. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when the Embedded OpenType Font Engine decompresses specially crafted files and content containing embedded fonts.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow in the decompression of EOT fonts by the Embedded OpenType Font Engine."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights. Users with fewer rights are less impacted.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Email: Attacker sends an email with a malicious Microsoft Word or PowerPoint attachment containing a specially crafted EOT font. The user must open the attachment.",
      "Web-based attack: Attacker hosts a webpage with malicious EOT fonts or uses compromised websites to host the exploit. The user must visit the website."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted EOT font. They would also need to convince the victim to either open a malicious document containing the font or visit a webpage hosting the font.",
        "Affected software": [
            "Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4",
            "Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3",
            "Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2",
