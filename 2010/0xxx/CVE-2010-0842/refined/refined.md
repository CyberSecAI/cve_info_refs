Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled array index in the `Sound` component of the Oracle Java SE and Java for Business.
- Specifically, when a `MixerSequencer` object is used to play a MIDI file, the `GM_Song` structure is populated with song data. An integer value from the file is used as an index into an array of function pointers. If this value exceeds 128, a pointer outside the array can be called, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled array index leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
- Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this by crafting a malicious MIDI file.
- The user needs to interact by visiting a web page containing a malicious Java applet or by opening the crafted MIDI file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a crafted MIDI file, usually on a web server.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to visit a malicious web page or open the crafted MIDI file.
- No special attacker privileges or user interaction beyond visiting the malicious page or opening the crafted file is required

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Peter Vreugdenhil.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Oracle's March 2010 CPU.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9651'].
- The affected versions of Java include: 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and 1.3.1\_27.
- This vulnerability is also mentioned in security advisories from SUSE, Vmware, HP, and Apple, affecting different versions of their products.
