  "relatedCves": [
    "CVE-2005-1080",
    "CVE-2006-3619",
    "CVE-2010-2322"
  ],
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `fastjar` program had a directory traversal flaw due to insufficient input sanitization when extracting files from a .jar archive. Specifically, it failed to properly handle filenames containing `..` (dot dot) sequences and absolute paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
      "Path Manipulation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on disk by crafting a malicious .jar archive and convincing a user to extract it. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A user must be convinced to extract a specially crafted .jar file.",
      "Exploitation requires the ability to write to the files to be overwritten"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .jar file with filenames containing `..` sequences or absolute paths. They also require the ability to convince a user to extract it.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability was due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-3619. The vulnerability also existed in the `jar` program provided by OpenJDK and `java-1.4.2-gcj-compat`."
