  "CVE-2010-0628": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the  `spnego_gss_accept_sec_context()` function within `src/lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego_mech.c`. An invalid packet received during the start of a GSS-API protocol exchange can cause the function to set internal state to send an error token without creating a context handle. Subsequent code contains an assert() call that requires the context handle to be non-null, causing an assertion failure.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Assertion failure in GSSAPI SPNEGO mechanism",
      "Improper handling of invalid packets leading to a crash"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted packets, causing a GSS-API application, including the Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind), to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted network packet.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service."
  }
