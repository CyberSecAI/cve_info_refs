Package: trac-git
Version: 0.0.20080710-3
Severity: grave
Tags: patch security
Justification: user security hole

The trac-git package in Debian Lenny - if enabled in Trac - allows a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the
rights of the user running Trac. The attacker must have the rights to
browse the repository in order to exploit this issue, other parts of
Trac are most likely not affected.

The attached patch fixes the problem, it is not thoroughly tested,
though, but seems to work fine on my test system with a few Git
repositories.

Sorry for the delay in responding, I've been away from my emails for a
few days, but I'm back now.

Anyway, thanks for this and the patch. I just wanted to note that I'd
not ignored this and I'll try and get something out today.

Cheerio,

Fixed in a new security update. Thanks to Stefan Fritsch for fixing my
screw-up in building the first package.

Package        : trac-git
Vulnerability  : shell command injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-0394
Debian Bug     : 567039

Stefan Goebel discovered that the Debian version of trac-git, the Git
add-on for the Trac issue tracking system, contains a flaw which
enables attackers to execute code on the web server running trac-git
by sending crafted HTTP queries.

The old stable distribution (etch) does not contain a trac-git package.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.20080710-3+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version 0.0.20090320-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your trac-git package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
