Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the GNU C Library (glibc) handles Network Information Service (NIS) shadow passwords when the Name Service Cache Daemon (nscd) is in use. Specifically, `getpwnam()` function was incorrectly merging password information from the `passwd.adjunct.byname` NIS map into the regular `passwd` map, making the password hashes readable to all users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Data Merging:** The `getpwnam()` function in glibc was designed to merge data from `passwd` and `passwd.adjunct.byname` maps. However, it was not intended to expose the password hashes from the `passwd.adjunct.byname` map which is meant to store shadow password information. This design flaw exposed the password hashes to all users.
*   **nscd Caching Issue:** The nscd daemon, which caches name service lookups, exacerbates the problem. Because nscd runs as root, and caches the merged password entries, it makes the password hashes available to all users, even when they are not supposed to have access to the adjunct password information.
*   **Lack of Proper Access Control:** The glibc implementation did not honor the intended NIS security model where the `passwd.adjunct.byname` map (containing the shadow password hashes) should only be readable by privileged users using a privileged source port on the NIS client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Password Hashes:** A local, unprivileged attacker could use the `getpwnam()` function to retrieve password hashes of all NIS users, including the root user.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** With the exposed password hashes, attackers could attempt to crack the passwords. Successfully cracked passwords could lead to further unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker only needs local access to a machine using NIS for user authentication to exploit this vulnerability. No network access directly to the NIS server is needed.
*   **`getpwnam()` function call**: A local, unprivileged attacker makes use of this library call to read the password hashes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on a machine configured as a NIS client.
*   **No elevated privileges required:** An unprivileged user can retrieve password hashes.
*   **Awareness of the Vulnerability**: The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was primarily present in setups using Solaris-based NIS servers where shadow information was stored in the `passwd.adjunct.byname` map and then merged with passwd data by glibc on the client side.
*   Solaris NIS servers restrict access to the `passwd.adjunct.byname` map to clients using a privileged port (source port < 1024). However, the vulnerable glibc code bypasses this restriction.
*   The fix involved preventing glibc from merging the shadow password information into the passwd map, and instead, providing an 'x' to indicate a shadow entry exists. Also, `getspnam()` was updated to properly retrieve shadow password information from the `passwd.adjunct.byname` map when the `shadow.byname` map does not exist on the NIS server.
*   A new mode "adjunct as shadow" was introduced in `/etc/default/nss` to enable the corrected behavior. This mode moves password hashes from the world-readable passwd table to emulated shadow table that is not cached by `nscd`.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in glibc and eglibc versions through patches that introduced the "adjunct as shadow" mode, and stopped leaking password information.
