```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application suffers from multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities and remote file inclusion vulnerabilities.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection, Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Impact of exploitation:
    - SQL Injection: Allows attackers to potentially read sensitive data, modify data, or execute arbitrary code on the database server.
    - Remote File Inclusion: Allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.
- Attack vectors:
    - SQL Injection: By injecting malicious SQL code into the 'id' parameter of multiple PHP scripts like `video_show.php`, `spotlight_detail.php`, `real_estate_details.php`, and `auto_details.php`.
    - Remote File Inclusion: By including a malicious file from an attacker-controlled server through the 'url' parameter of the `external.php` script.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - For SQL injection, the attacker needs to be able to access the application through the web interface and manipulate HTTP parameters.
    - For Remote file Inclusion, the attacker needs to be able to access the application through the web interface and have a web server hosting a malicious file.
