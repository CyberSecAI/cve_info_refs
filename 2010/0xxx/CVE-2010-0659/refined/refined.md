{
  "CVE-2010-0659": {
    "Description": "The provided data relates to a fix for a memory allocation issue in the GIF image decoder within WebKit. Specifically, the decoder did not properly handle memory allocation failures, which could lead to issues. This is described in the provided webkit changelog and also referenced in the opensuse security summary report.",
    "Root cause": "The GIF decoder in WebKit did not stop decoding when memory allocation failed, potentially leading to further issues and memory errors.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of memory allocation failures"
    ],
    "Impact": "The primary impact is related to memory errors and crashes when the decoder fails to allocate memory, potentially causing a denial of service. Additionally, it's possible other memory corruption issues could be triggered.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability could be triggered by processing a specially crafted GIF file, leading the decoder to fail during memory allocation. An attacker could deliver such files through a website, email or other means.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to deliver a malicious GIF file that would trigger the allocation failure within the browser. No special position is necessary."
