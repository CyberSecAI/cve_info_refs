  "CVE-2010-0224": {
    "is_related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability affecting multiple vendors (Kingston, SanDisk, Verbatim) of USB flash drives with hardware-based AES 256-bit encryption. The core issue is not a weakness in the AES algorithm itself, but rather a flawed implementation where the password authentication process is handled in software on the host computer instead of within the USB drive's hardware.",
    "details": [
      {
        "weakness": "The primary vulnerability lies in the flawed design of the password authentication process. Instead of the USB drive itself verifying the password, the software on the host computer sends a fixed, static character string (effectively a universal key) to the USB drive when unlocking. This means that any software, even a malicious one, can use this string to unlock the device, completely bypassing password security.  This is compounded by the fact that the data is not encrypted on the drive using the user's password but rather a static, hardcoded key.",
         "impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability will lead to unauthorized access to all encrypted data on the affected USB drive.  Since the authentication is done outside of the USB, the data is made available to any attacker who can use the static unlock string.  This allows a third party to easily access sensitive data stored on the drive, and because data is decrypted, they have access to it as though they had the password.",
        "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves intercepting or replacing the authentication software on the host computer.  A malicious actor only needs to send the correct command (the static character string) to the USB drive, bypassing the actual user password.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have knowledge of the static unlock string used by the affected USB drives and be able to execute commands on a system that the target USB is plugged in to. They do not need to know the user's password to gain access to the contents of the USB.  The ability to modify or intercept communications between the device and host system would enable the attack. Additionally, physical access to the USB drive is implied in order to be able to read the data."
      },
       {
          "weakness":"FIPS 140-2 compliance, while proving usage of certified encryption algorithms, does not fully certify the whole system and allows the insecure implementation of the encryption process.",
          "impact":"FIPS 140-2 certification was not a proper indication of security for the affected devices. Customers may have falsely believed data to be secure, due to FIPS 140-2 certification."
       },
        {
          "weakness":"The data decryption is often done in the host system software and then passed onto the USB, which is another vector of vulnerability. Truecrypt and other third party encryption solutions handle encryption on the USB device itself.",
           "impact":"This could allow malicious software on the host system to read the data once it is decrypted, since the host system itself is not necessarily trusted or secure. By performing the encryption on the device itself, the host is not able to access the decrypted data."
