  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2010-0441",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Asterisk handles the 'FaxMaxDatagram' field within the Session Description Protocol (SDP) during T.38 fax negotiation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
         "Integer handling vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the Asterisk server.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through SIP, by modifying the 'FaxMaxDatagram' field in the SDP to include negative, exceptionally large values, or omitting the field entirely, while negotiating a T.38 fax session.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to initiate a SIP session with an Asterisk server and manipulate the SDP. No authentication is required."
    },
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2010-0441",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the usage of `%30d` format specifier with `sscanf` which treats the input as a signed integer. The fix uses `%30u` which treats it as unsigned integer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer handling vulnerability",
        "Format string vulnerability due to the usage of %d"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the Asterisk server when attempting to negotiate T.38 fax.",
       "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through SIP. The attacker manipulates the T.38 fax negotiation by providing a negative or exceptionally large value in the FaxMaxDatagram field of the SDP, or omitting it completely.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to establish a SIP session with the vulnerable Asterisk server and manipulate the SDP."
