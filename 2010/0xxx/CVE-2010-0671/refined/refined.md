Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper input validation of the "id" parameter in the Pogodny CMS. The CMS fails to sanitize or validate the input, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the "id" parameter to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- High Risk: The vulnerability is classified as high risk. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database
    - Modify or delete data within the database
    - Potentially gain control of the server, depending on database permissions

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request where the "id" parameter is modified to inject malicious SQL code.
- Specifically, the vulnerable URL is identified as `http://server/?modul=niusy&id=61[Sqli]`, showing how the `id` parameter can be manipulated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special access is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Pogodny CMS.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and web requests is needed to craft the exploit.
