{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Adobe Reader and Acrobat due to insufficient input validation and memory management.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary code execution",
    "Arbitrary file/folder write",
    "Local privilege escalation",
    "Denial of service"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file, leading to arbitrary code execution, writing arbitrary files or folders, escalating local privileges, or causing a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs when a user opens a malicious PDF document, either directly or through a web browser that automatically opens PDF files. The browser plugin also opens PDF documents automatically, posing additional risk.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PDF document and convince a user to open it, either through email, a website or other means."
