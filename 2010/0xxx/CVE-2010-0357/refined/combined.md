# PM04647: WCM CUMULATIVE IFIX 32 FOR 6.0.1.4, 6.0.1.5, 6.0.1.6

##

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  WCM CUMULATIVE IFIX 32 FOR 6.0.1.4, 6.0.1.5, 6.0.1.6

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  Users Affected: All IWWCM users

  Detailed Problem Description:

  This is a cumulative iFix for IBM Web Content Managagement, for
  version 6.0.1.x. This fix is applicable to WP v6.0.1.4, WP
  v6.0.1.5 and WP v6.0.1.6

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  Problem Analysis:

  This cumulative iFix targets a number of problem areas in the GA
  release of WCM v6.0.1.4 , WCM v6.0.1.5 and WCM v6.0.1.6.
  Specifically, defects in the following areas have been targeted:
  Migration, API, Versioning, Syndication, Rendering, Authoring

  This fix has a co-requisite dependency on [PK76701](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK76701) (WebSphere
  Portal) , [PK89284](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK89284) (JCR. For WCM v6.0.1.4 , WCM v6.0.1.5),
  [PK99291](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK99291) (JCR for WCM v6.0.1.4, WCM v6.0.1.5, WCM v6.0.1.6)

  The migration tool now finds all orphan site areas and migrates
  these to a site called orphans. Previously it was necessary to
  run the Site Checker before migration to ensure that all orphan
  site areas were accounted for. One side effect of this feature
  is that all orphans are aggregated into the same site, even
  those which were previously found by the Site Checker.

  Failing Module: WCM - Web Content Management (General)

  Problem Solution:

  The following new APARs are included in Cumulative iFix 32 for
  WCM v6.0.1.4, WCM v6.0.1.5 WCM v6.0.1.6, in addition to the
  fixes already integrated in previous CFs:

  [PortalServer]\wcm\prereq.wcm\installableApps
     - Click Next and Finish
  - Log out of Portal for the changes to take effect.

  Refer to the clustering section of the Portal Information Center
  (typically 'Clustering -> Performing Upgrades in a 24x7
  cluster') for additional information on installing interim fixes
  in clustered environments while maintaining continuous
  availability of your Portal.

  After the iFix is installed, check the status of the node you
  are upgrading in the Deployment Manager administrative console.
  If the status is Not Synchronized, ensure that the node agent is
  running on the node and then perform the following steps:
  In the Deployment Manager administrative console, click System
  Administration>Nodes.
  For the node with a status of Not Synchronized,
  click Synchronize.
  After the synchronization is complete, wait at least 30 minutes
  before performing the next step because the ear expander is
  still running.
  Restart the WebSphere_Portal server on the secondary node.

  APAR configuration:
  PK74353 (Add utility to allow bulk removal of drafts)

  A new DraftDetectionModule with optional 'remove' mode
  (remove=true) has been developed to automate removing drafts.
  The module must first be configured in the WCM configuration
  file (like similar modules such as the
  MemberFixer/LibraryDelete)
  before it can be used. To configure the new module, perform the
  following steps:
  1) Edit the
  \wcm\shared\app\config\wcmservices\WCMConfigService.properties
  file
  1a) Add the following three lines underneath the
  'connect.businesslogic.module' property:
  connect.businesslogic.module.draftdetection.class=com.aptrix.plu
  to.workflow.DraftDetectionModule
  connect.businesslogic.module.draftdetection.remoteaccess=true
  connect.businesslogic.module.draftdetection.autoload=false
  1b) Add 'draftdetection' to the end of the
  'connect.businesslogic.module' property
  connect.businesslogic.module=<existing entries>,draftdetection
  2) Restart the server To run the new module in report mode,
  hit the following URL in the browser:
  http://[HOST]:[PORT]/wps/wcm/connect/?MOD=draftdetection&library
  =[LIBRARY]
  To run the new module in remove mode, hit the following URL in
  the browser:
  http://[HOST]:[PORT]/wps/wcm/connect/?MOD=draftdetection&library
  =[LIBRARY]&remove=true

  Search (included in CF7 and above) a new field called
  ControllableID has been added to the seedlist attributes. After
  applying the cumulative fix, if the Search Component is
  accessing a collection crawled using the old seedlist, it will
  fail to return any results, because the ControllableID was not
  stored earlier. In such cases the Content Source will need to be
  re-created or re-crawled as follows:
   -Edit the Site and uncheck the "searchable" box.
   -Save the Site (This will remove the content source for the
  Site).
   -Edit the Site and enable the "searchable" box
   -Save the Site.
   -Go to Manage Search -> Collections -> Content Source created
  for this Site and run the crawl again.

  [PK88848](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK88848) (TASK REQUIRED TO RESET THE EVENT LOG DATABASE WHILE THE
  SYSTEM IS RUNNING.)

  This fix provides a module to reset the event log database while
  the system is running. The module is enabled by performing the
  following in the WCMConfigServices.properties file:

  1) Add 'reseteventlog
  ' to end of the 'connect.businesslogic.module' property.

  2) Adding the following lines:

  connect.businesslogic.module.reseteventlog.class=com.ibm.workpla
  ce.wcm.services.eventlog.ResetEventLogModule
  connect.businesslogic.module.reseteventlog.remoteaccess=true
  connect.businesslogic.module.reseteventlog.autoload=false

  3) Restart the server

  The module can then be accessed by entering the following in
  your browser's address bar:

  http://[HOST]:[PORT]/wps/wcm/myconnect?MOD=reseteventlog&library
  =[NAME OF LIBRARY TO RESET]

  To start the reset task append &fix=true to the above URL.

  This module will take a short time to run and respond to the
  browser. A background task started by the module will continue
  to run on the server after the module has responded and can take
  up to several hours or days to complete. Any items modified
  between the last successful syndication and the time you get a
  response from this module in your browser will not be syndicated
  until the background task has completed. To avoid this
  limitation you should follow these steps:

  1. Stop all authoring activity on the server
  2. Run a syndication update to ensure the subscriber is up to
  date with all the current items in the event log
  3. Run this module in fix mode
  4. Wait for the module to respond to the browser (this should
  only take a few minutes)
  5. Continue authoring
  6. The background task will populate the event log with all
  historical entries
  7. Any authoring activity will add new entries
  8. Syndication updates will continue to send any new entries
  added to the event log
  9. When the background task is complete you can perform a
  syndication full rebuild to check all historical entries

  To see the status of the background task, run this module again
  IN REPORT MODE.
  Un-Installation Steps:

  NOTE: FIXES MUST BE REMOVED IN THE ORDER THEY WERE APPLIED.
        DO NOT REMOVE A FIX UNLESS ALL FIXES APPLIED AFTER IT HAVE
  FIRST BEEN REMOVED.
        YOU MAY REAPPLY ANY REMOVED FIX.

  - Shutdown WebSphere Portal.
  - Follow the instructions that are packaged with the Portal
  Update Installer on how to uninstall a fix.
  - Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to
  the deployed WCM EAR or portlet WAR directories
  - Run [WP_PROFILE_ROOT]\ConfigEngine\ConfigEngine.bat|sh
  update-wcm -DPortalAdminPwd=password
  - Restart WebSphere Portal.

  Refer to the clustering section of the Portal Information Center
  (typically 'Clustering -> Performing Upgrades in a 24x7
  cluster') for additional information on uninstalling interim
  fixes in clustered environments while maintaining continuous
  availability of your Portal.

  DISCLAIMER:

  This fix has received limited testing only and has not undergone
  IBM's complete quality assurance process. It is therefore
  recommended that it be tested in a testing environment before
  applying it to a working (authoring, production/live) system.
  You should always backup your data before installing a fix or
  fixpack.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
