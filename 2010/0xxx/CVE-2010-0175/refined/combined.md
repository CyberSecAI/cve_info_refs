- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel

Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Mozilla Firefox nsTreeSelection EventListener Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-050ZDI-CAN-669

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-0175](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0175) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [3.5.x](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['3377']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on software utilizing a vulnerable version of Mozilla's Firefox. User interaction is required in that the victim must visit a malicious website or be coerced into opening a malicious document.  The specific flaw exists within how the application handles particular events for an nsTreeSelection element. Upon execution of a "select" event the application will access an element without checking to see if it's been previously freed or not. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2010/mfsa2010-17.html> |

Package        : xulrunner
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-0174 CVE-2010-0175 CVE-2010-0176 CVE-2010-0177 CVE-2010-0178 CVE-2010-0179

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web
browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2010-0174

    Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari discovered crashes in the layout
    engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0175

    It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the XUL event
    handler might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0176

    It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the XUL event
    handler might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0177

    It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the plugin code
    might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-0178

    Paul Stone discovered that forced drag-and-drop events could lead to
    Chrome privilege escalation.

CVE-2010-0179

    It was discovered that a programming error in the XMLHttpRequestSpy
    module could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.19-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world뗩 best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft뗩 Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren뗪 normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-17

## Remote code execution with use-after-free in nsTreeSelection

Announced
March 30, 2010
Reporter
regenrecht (via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative)
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.19
* Firefox 3.5.9
* SeaMonkey 2.0.4
* Thunderbird 3.0.4

### Description

Security researcher **regenrecht** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a select event handler for XUL
tree items could be called after the tree item was deleted. This
results in the execution of previously freed memory which an attacker
could use to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's computer.

This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Attached patch

[patch](attachment.cgi?id=389876&action=diff)
 [Details](attachment.cgi?id=389876&action=edit)
 [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=375928&attachment=389876)

Better to keep everything alive when dispatching an event.
Without the patch self->mSelectTimer = nsnull; may use deleted 'self', I think.
The patch is the safest possible. Better one would be to set mSelectTimer to null
before firing the event, but that'd change the behavior.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world뗩 best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft뗩 Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren뗪 normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ZDI-CAN-669: Mozilla Firefox nsTreeSelection EventListener Use-after-free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on software utilizing a vulnerable version of Mozilla's Firefox. User interaction is required in that the victim must visit a malicious website or be coerced into opening a malicious document.
The specific flaw exists within how the application handles particular events for an nsTreeSelection element. Upon execution of a "select" event the application will access an element without checking to see if it's been previously freed or not. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the application.
This vulnerability occurs due to firing an event on an object that has already been freed and can be reproduced with the following code:
<tree id="tr" flex="1">
<treechildren>
<treeitem>
<treerow>
<treecell/>
</treerow>
</treeitem>
</treechildren>
</tree>
tree = document.getElementById('tr');
tree.addEventListener("select", function (e) {}, false);
tree.view.selection.timedSelect(0, 5000); // XXX: fire "select" event
in 5 seconds
tree.view.selection = null; // XXX: freed
Upon calling timedSelect on a tree.view.selection object, the application will instantiate a new timer, and call SelectCallback when it fires.
layout/xul/base/src/tree/src/nsTreeSelection.cpp:336
NS\_IMETHODIMP nsTreeSelection::TimedSelect(PRInt32 aIndex, PRInt32
aMsec)
{
PRBool suppressSelect = mSuppressed;
if (aMsec != -1)
mSuppressed = PR\_TRUE;
nsresult rv = Select(aIndex);
if (NS\_FAILED(rv))
return rv;
if (aMsec != -1) {
mSuppressed = suppressSelect;
if (!mSuppressed) {
if (mSelectTimer)
mSelectTimer->Cancel();
mSelectTimer = do\_CreateInstance("@mozilla.org/timer;1");
mSelectTimer->InitWithFuncCallback(SelectCallback, this, aMsec,
// XXX
nsITimer::TYPE\_ONE\_SHOT);
}
}
return NS\_OK;
}
At this point, a malicious individual will want to free the tree.view.selection the timer has been created for. Once the timer fires, the callback will then be executed. The following code will load the closure representing the callback, and then execute it.
layout/xul/base/src/tree/src/nsTreeSelection.cpp:847
void
nsTreeSelection::SelectCallback(nsITimer \*aTimer, void \*aClosure)
{
nsTreeSelection\* self = static\_cast<nsTreeSelection\*>(aClosure);
if (self) {
self->FireOnSelectHandler(); // XXX
aTimer->Cancel();
self->mSelectTimer = nsnull;
}
}
The select handler that's been fired, will load the code for the event and then execute it. At this point the tree.view.selection object has been freed.
layout/xul/base/src/tree/src/nsTreeSelection.cpp:827
nsresult
nsTreeSelection::FireOnSelectHandler()
{
if (mSuppressed || !mTree)
return NS\_OK;
nsCOMPtr<nsIBoxObject> boxObject = do\_QueryInterface(mTree);
NS\_ASSERTION(boxObject, "no box object!");
if (!boxObject)
return NS\_ERROR\_UNEXPECTED;
nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMElement> elt;
boxObject->GetElement(getter\_AddRefs(elt));
NS\_ENSURE\_STATE(elt);
nsRefPtr<nsPLDOMEvent> event =
new nsPLDOMEvent(elt, NS\_LITERAL\_STRING("select"));
event->RunDOMEventWhenSafe(); // XXX
return NS\_OK;
}

The PoC explanation isn't quite right.
But anyway, my bad, this is fixed on 1.9.2/trunk, see [bug 375928](/show_bug.cgi?id=375928 "RESOLVED FIXED - [@ nsTreeRange::Contains]").

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.5](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.5) -
* [xulrunner-1.9.1](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.1) -

## Details

Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, Jesse Ruderman, and Ehsan Akhgari discovered

flaws in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing

a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2010-0173](/security/CVE-2010-0173), [CVE-2010-0174](/security/CVE-2010-0174))

It was discovered that Firefox could be made to access previously freed

memory. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0175](/security/CVE-2010-0175),

[CVE-2010-0176](/security/CVE-2010-0176), [CVE-2010-0177](/security/CVE-2010-0177))

Paul Stone discovered that Firefox could be made to change a mouse click

into a drag and drop event. If the user could be tricked into performing

this action twice on a crafted website, an attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2010-0178](/security/CVE-2010-0178))

It was discovered that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module as used by the Firebug

add-on could be used to escalate privileges within the browser. If the user

had the Firebug add-on installed and were tricked into viewing a malicious

website, an attacker could potentially run arbitrary JavaScript.

([CVE-2010-0179](/security/CVE-2010-0179))

Henry Sudhof discovered that an image tag could be used as a redirect to

a mailto: URL to launch an external mail handler. ([CVE-2010-0181](/security/CVE-2010-0181))

Wladimir Palant discovered that Firefox did not always perform security

checks on XML content. An attacker could exploit this to bypass security

policies to load certain resources. ([CVE-2010-0182](/security/CVE-2010-0182))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [xulrunner-1.9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.1)
  -
  [1.9.1.9+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.1/1.9.1.9%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)
* [firefox-3.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.5)
  -
  [3.5.9+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.5/3.5.9%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |

| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
