## 2010.01.05: Nasty security bug

2010-01-05

Simon Lipp brought to our attention a nasty security bug.
Apparently there are ways for javascripts from a website to reach our 'Uzbl'
object an use its "run" function, by using DOM method overriding, stack
inspection and maybe more.
I'm far from an expert in the field so I suggest you check the [thread](http://lists.uzbl.org/pipermail/uzbl-dev-uzbl.org/2010-January/000586.html)
on the mailing list for more details.
But basically, if site admins modify their JS they can use the 'Uzbl.run'
feature to execute uzbl commands (such as shell commands).
One of the many possible exploits is demonstrated [here](http://users.edpnet.be/dieter/exploit.html).
It will show you the output of 'cat /etc/fstab'.

So do not run any uzbl version that has the 'Uzbl.run' feature (was
introduced at release 2009-07-03).

We're currently finding out how to plug this hole decently without loosing
features, but for now you should use this new release which is nothing more then 2009.11.22 with the
Uzbl object disabled.
This will break local javascripts who rely on it, such as:
- link follower scripts
- scroll-percentage.js (used for displaying the scroll percentage in statusbar)
- extedit.js (used for editing html textareas with external editor)
- js code in config to focus input area on pageload and change mode depending on focus.

All my git branches also have this temporary fix applied

|  |  | ### JAVASCRIPT HELPER OBJECT DISABLED BECAUSE OF SECURITY LEAK |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Javascript code run from uzbl is given a special object in the global namespace which gives special privileges to these scripts. This object is called `Uzbl`, and it is added and removed before and after the script execution so that it is hidden to web javascripts (There is no race condition, since all the javascript code runs in a single thread) |
|  |  |  |
| Expand All | | @@ -410,25 +410,6 @@ Currently, the `Uzbl` object provides only one function: |
|  |  | \* `Uzbl.run("spawn insert\_bookmark.sh")` |
|  |  | \* `uri = Uzbl.run("print @uri")` (see variable expansion below) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### JAVASCRIPT SECURITY |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Since defined variables and functions are set in the global namespace (`window` object) as default, it is recommended to wrap your scripts like this: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | (function(Uzbl) { |
|  |  | ... |
|  |  | })(Uzbl); |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This way, everything is kept private. It also turns Uzbl into a local variable, which can be accessed from callback functions defined inside. However for some situations, isolating everything isn't an option, for example, with binds. You can define them directly in the script body, and use `var Uzbl = window.Uzbl;` to make the Uzbl variable local, as in the following example: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | function f() { |
|  |  | var Uzbl = window.Uzbl; |
|  |  | Uzbl.run(...); |
|  |  | setTimeout(function() { |
|  |  | Uzbl.run(...); |
|  |  | }, 500); |
|  |  | } |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Copying the Uzbl object and creating public functions should be taken with care to avoid creating security holes. Keep in mind that the "f" function above would be defined in the `window` object, and as such any javascript in the current page can call it. |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
