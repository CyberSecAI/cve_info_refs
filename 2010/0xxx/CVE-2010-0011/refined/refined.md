Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-0011

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Uzbl (a web browser) exposed its internal `Uzbl` object to Javascript code running within web pages. This `Uzbl` object had a `run` function that could be used to execute arbitrary Uzbl commands, including shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Javascript Object Exposure:** The `Uzbl` object, with its powerful `run` function, was accessible to Javascript code within web pages.
- **DOM Method Overriding and Stack Inspection:** Malicious Javascript could use DOM method overriding and stack inspection techniques to access the `Uzbl` object and its `run` function, even though it was intended to be hidden from web Javascript.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `Uzbl.run()` function did not properly sanitize input, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the `Uzbl.run()` function, an attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands on the user's machine running Uzbl.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could use the command execution to read sensitive files (as demonstrated in the provided example, `cat /etc/fstab`).
- **System Compromise:** In a broader sense, the vulnerability could lead to complete system compromise, depending on the level of access granted to the user running Uzbl.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Websites:** An attacker could host a malicious website containing Javascript that exploits the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** An attacker could inject malicious Javascript into legitimate websites, targeting users who browse those sites with a vulnerable version of Uzbl.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Serve Malicious Javascript:** The attacker needs to be able to serve malicious Javascript to a user running a vulnerable version of Uzbl. This could be through hosting a website or injecting Javascript into another site.
- **No User Interaction (Beyond Navigating to a Site):** The exploit could occur automatically when a user visits the malicious website, requiring no further interaction.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Uzbl version 2009-07-03.
- The fix involved disabling the `Uzbl` Javascript object completely in the 2010-01-05 release.
- The provided commit on Github shows the disabling of the `Uzbl` object.
- The provided links demonstrate how an attacker could use the vulnerability to execute commands such as `cat /etc/fstab`.

The vulnerability allowed for remote code execution, making it a severe security risk.
