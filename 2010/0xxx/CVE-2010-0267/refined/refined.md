  "CVE-2010-0267": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been properly initialized or has been deleted.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized memory corruption.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution with the same privileges as the logged-on user. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative rights. This could allow the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted web page or embed an ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document. Users would need to be convinced to view the malicious web page or open the malicious file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to view a malicious web page or open a malicious document. The attacker can exploit from a remote position. No special privileges or authentication is required."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to how Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized memory corruption resulting in remote code execution.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.",
       "Attack vectors": "The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted website or embedding a malicious ActiveX control. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability by visiting the malicious website or opening a malicious document.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a website or deliver a malicious document and lure a user into interacting with it. No special privileges or authentication is needed on the target system."
    },
   {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted, leading to memory corruption.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized memory corruption",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution with user-level privileges. With admin user privileges, attacker could take complete control of an affected system.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted Web page or Microsoft Office document.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user into viewing the malicious page/document. No authentication or special privileges are required, other than the ability to host a webpage or send a malicious file."
