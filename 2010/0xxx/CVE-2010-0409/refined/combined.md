# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=561457#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-02-03 17:26:16 UTC  ``` Buffer overflow flaw was reported and fixed in the GMime library, in the code part responsible for calculating the maximum number of output bytes generated by an uuencode operation.   If a local user was tricked into running a specially-crafted application, using the library, it could lead to denial of service (supplied application crash) or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running that application.  Upstream v2.4.15 changes file:   <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gmime/2.4/gmime-2.4.15.changes>  Diff between v2.4.14 and v2.4.15:   <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gmime/2.4/gmime-2.4.14-2.4.15.diff.gz>  References:   <http://secunia.com/advisories/38459/>   <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gmime/2.4/gmime-2.4.15.tar.gz>  CVE Request:   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/02/03/2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=561457#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-02-03 17:32:41 UTC  ``` This issue affects the latest versions of the gmime and gmime22 packages, as shipped with Fedora release of 11 (gmime-2.4.3-6.fc11,  gmime22-2.2.23-5.fc11) and 12 (gmime-2.4.11-1.fc12, gmime22-2.2.23-7.fc12).  Please fix.  This issue does NOT affect the versions of the gmime package, as  shipped within Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux -- EPEL-4 (gmime-2.2.1-2.el4) and EPEL-5 (gmime-2.2.3-3.1.el5) projects.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=561457#c2)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-04 02:27:21 UTC  ``` gmime22-2.2.23-8.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gmime22-2.2.23-8.fc11>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=561457#c3)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-04 02:28:09 UTC  ``` gmime22-2.2.23-8.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gmime22-2.2.23-8.fc12>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=561457#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-02-04 09:05:43 UTC  ``` This is [CVE-2010-0409](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0409).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=561457#c5)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-05 01:17:47 UTC  ``` gmime22-2.2.23-8.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=561457#c6)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-05 01:39:47 UTC  ``` gmime22-2.2.23-8.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=561457#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-16 10:45:36 UTC  ``` Alex, Xavier, Bernard,    could you please schedule F11 and F12 gmime updates? (current gmime-2.4.3-6.fc11 and gmime-2.4.11-1.fc12 are  still prone to this flaw).  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
