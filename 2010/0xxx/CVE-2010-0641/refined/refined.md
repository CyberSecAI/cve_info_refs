```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Additionally, the application reveals the source code of .jhtml files through specific URL manipulations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Source Code Disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "XSS can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions. Source code disclosure can expose sensitive information and potentially reveal other vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The XSS vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious script into the 'dest' parameter of the 'LoginPage.jhtml' URL.",
    "Source code disclosure is achieved by appending specific encodings such as '%2Ejhtml', '%6C', '%00', or '%c0%80' to the end of a .jhtml file URL."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and have them accessed by a victim user or directly access the application through a web browser."
