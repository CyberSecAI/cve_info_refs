How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : hybserv
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2010-0303
Debian Bug     : 550389

Julien Cristau discovered that hybserv, a daemon running IRC services
for IRCD-Hybrid, is prone to a denial of service attack via the commands
option.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.2-4+lenny2.

Due to a bug in the archive system, it is not possible to release the
fix for the oldstable distribution (etch) simultaneously. Therefore,
etch will be fixed in version 1.9.2-4+etch1 as soon as it becomes
available.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.2-4.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your hybserv packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: hybserv: misparsing when sent commands with tabs

```
Package: hybserv
Version: 1.9.2-4
Severity: important
Tags: patch

Hi,

sending 'PRIVMSG memoserv :help \t' crashes hybserv.
GiveHelp is called with command="\t", so SplitBuf(command, &cav) at
helpserv.c:365 returns 0, and the next line calls strlcpy() with src ==
NULL.
I fixed this by replacing "while (*buf == ' ')" with "while
(IsSpace(*buf))" in mystring.c:145.  This way the first parsing in
ms_process() returns 1, and m_help() calls GiveHelp with command ==
NULL, avoiding the crash.
All of mystring.c, memoserv.c and helpserv.c seem to be unchanged
between 1.9.2 and 1.9.4 so I'm pretty sure it's not fixed in any
upstream release.

Cheers,
Julien

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
