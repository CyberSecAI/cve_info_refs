{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Windows kernel does not correctly allocate memory when extracting the destination key from a symbolic-link type registry key.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper memory allocation within the Windows kernel when handling symbolic links in registry keys."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to complete control of the affected system. This allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local execution of a specially crafted application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system."
