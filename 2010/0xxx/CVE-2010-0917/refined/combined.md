Microsoft's security team is investigating a security vulnerability in older versions of Windows that allows attackers to execute malware on end user machines.

The bug combines scripts based on Microsoft's Visual Basic language with Windows help files for Internet Explorer. It makes it possible for an attacker hosting a malicious website to remotely run arbitrary code by convincing the user to press the computer's F1 key in response to a popup window.

The vulnerability doesn't threaten users of Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Vista, Microsoft's Jerry Bryant [wrote here](http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2010/02/28/investigating-a-new-win32hlp-and-internet-explorer-issue.aspx), and so far, there are no reports of attacks that exploit the weakness.

The attack was [described on Friday](http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0027-msgbox-helpfile-ie.txt) by Maurycy Prodeus of [iSec Security Research](http://isec.pl/). The vulnerability is the result of the passing a samba share as a helpfile parameter, he said. The researcher also warned there is a stack based buffer overflow in the winhelp32.exe file when parameters are too long.

Microsoft plans to issue guidance once its investigation is completed, Bryant said. ®

===[ ABSTRACT ]=========================================================
It is possible to invoke winhlp32.exe from Internet Explorer 8,7,6
using VBScript. Passing malicious .HLP file to winhlp32 could allow
remote attacker to run arbitrary command.
Additionally, there is a stack overflow vulnerability in winhlp32.exe.
===[ AFFECTED SOFTWARE ]================================================
Windows XP SP3
NOT AFFECTED: Vista, Windows 7
===[ DESCRIPTION ]======================================================
To trigger vulnerability some user interaction is needed. Victim has to
press F1 when MsgBox popup is displayed.
Syntax of MsgBox function:
MsgBox(prompt[,buttons][,title][,helpfile,context])
It is possible to pass remote samba share as helpfile parameter.
In addition there is a stack based buffer overflow when helpfile
parameter is too long. However, on XP winhlp32.exe is compiled with
/GS flag, which in this case effectively guard the stack.
Proof-of-Concept is available here:
