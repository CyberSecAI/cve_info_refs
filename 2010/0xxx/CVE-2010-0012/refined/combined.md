1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Specially crafted PDF files could crash acroread. Attackers could
potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-3953,
CVE-2009-3954, CVE-2009-3955, CVE-2009-3956, CVE-2009-3957,
CVE-2009-3958, CVE-2009-3959, CVE-2009-4324).
Acrobat reader was updated to version 9.3 to fix the security issues.
Note: Due to integration issues with the major version update of
acroread on SLE10 updates for SLE10 are not ready yet. Fixed
packages will be submitted ASAP.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of acroread after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

5) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
- transmission
Specially crafted torrent files could overwrite arbitrary files
(CVE-2010-0012).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libopenssl-devel
Incorrect use of an openssl cleanup function can lead to memory
leaks in applications. For example an ssl enabled web server such as
apache that uses php, curl and openssl leaks memory if a SIGHUP
signal was sent to apache. The openssl cleanup function was made
more robust to avoid memory leaks (CVE-2009-4355).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- gzip
Specially crafted gzip archives could lead to gzip allocating a too
small huffman table. Attackers could exploit that to crash gzip
(CVE-2009-2624).
Specially crafted gzip archives could trigger integer overflows.
Attackers could exploit that to crash gzip or potentially execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2010-0001). Only 64bit architectures are
affected by this flaw.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- bind
bind when configured for DNSSEC could incorrectly cache NXDOMAIN
responses (CVE-2010-0097). Moreover, the fix for CVE-2009-4022 was
incomplete. Despite the previous fix CNAME and DNAME responses could
be incorrectly cached (CVE-2010-0290).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- viewvc
viewvc was updated to version 1.1.3 which fixes the following security problems:
- add root listing support of per-root authz config (CVE-2010-0004).
- query.py requires 'forbidden' authorizer (or none) in config (CVE-2010-0005).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1967-q                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : transmission
Vulnerability  : directory traversal
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-0012

Dan Rosenberg discovered that Transmission, a lightwight client for
the Bittorrent filesharing protocol performs insufficient sanitising
of file names specified in .torrent files. This could lead to the
overwrite of local files with the privileges of the user running
Transmission if the user is tricked into opening a malicious torrent
file.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.22-1+lenny2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.77-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your transmission packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: transmission

I've discovered a design flaw in the Transmission BitTorrent client that I would consider to be a security vulnerability. The Transmission client permits arbitrary characters in the names of files included in torrents, including characters that allow directory traversal (such as "../"). In addition, the client does not prompt the user before overwriting existing files with the same name as a file that is to be downloaded via torrent.

An attacker can create a malicious torrent file containing a file named specifically to overwrite important files on disk. For example, "../.ssh/authorized\_keys" could be provided as a filename included in a torrent, and Transmission will download the provided file and store it at that location (assuming the default download location of ~/Desktop), overwriting the preexisting keys file and potentially giving an attacker SSH access to the victim's machine. If the user happens to be running Transmission as root (who knows?), the possibilities are even scarier.

I have confirmed this behavior with a simple proof-of-concept torrent and text file, which I've attached. To confirm behavior, download the EVIL text file (which is just a sentence of text), and open the attached .torrent file in a child directory. For example, if EVIL is in "~/", open the .torrent from "~/Desktop". The torrent should begin seeding. From another machine, create a blank file (or any file, really) called EVIL at some location. This file represents an existing file on disk, and presumably wouldn't be called "EVIL" in a real situation. Note its contents, and open the .torrent file at a child directory, just as before. Once the download starts, you should note that the EVIL file in the parent directory has been overwritten with the contents of the torrent's EVIL file.

Clearly, the desired behavior is to download files into the current directory, not permitting any directory traversal, and perhaps prompting the user before overwriting existing data. This could be easily fixed by stripping ".." from incoming file names.

Although this attack requires a victim to open a malicious torrent file, because it does not require the victim to actually execute malicious code I would still consider it a security problem. Torrents are very widespread, and it would be trivial to host a malicious torrent containing legitimate files alongside files designed to compromise a victim's system. The fact that an attacker would have immediate knowledge of compromised victims via the torrent is especially dangerous.

I confirmed this behavior in Transmission 1.75 on Karmic, using both the GTK interface and transmission-cli.

Dan, thanks very much for the sample .torrent file. I'm travelling over Christmas at the moment but will test out the evil torrent ASAP and if it works as advertised I'll try to get a patch done in the next day or two and upload it when I get online next.

Actually it didn't take very long to test, verify, fix, and reverify, so I've committed a fix to svn.

Great, Charles, thanks for the fast work. Looks like a good fix to me. I guess all that's left now is in the hands of the Ubuntu security folks...assigning a CVE, coordinating with other distros, and publishing an advisory.

Thanks again for the prompt response, and happy holidays.

Dan, would it be possible to keep quiet on this one for about a week s.t. I can get a 1.77 release out \*before\* the security announcement, so that the other distros will have a clear upgrade path?

Absolutely. I was counting on Ubuntu Security to coordinate with other distros and publish the advisory, so I would only publish myself if there's no response from them. In either event, I'm happy to wait as long as necessary to make sure the fix is available to everyone.

Charles, since your commit is public, you can release 1.77 at any time. Once you do, let me know, and I'll post a CVE request to the oss-security list.

Initial testing shows that Hardy and Intrepid aren't affected. Transmission strips out the '/' in '../' for a file, and therefore the file that is created using the above is $HOME/Desktop/..EVIL.

Well, they aren't at least affected in the same way. Charles, would it be possible for you to confirm for Transmission 1.06 (hardy) and 1.34 (intrepid).

Intrepid confirmed when using a directory. Eg, if the torrent has:

../bad

../bad/foo

Then do on the affected client:

$ mkdir bad

$ echo "my data" > ./bad/foo

Then opening $HOME/Desktop/bad.torrent will overwrite 'foo'. This doesn't seem to be a problem for Hardy, but I'm still investigating.

Marian - for future reference, you click on "Also affects project", and choose a difference project if the correct one is not selected by default. Hardy backports are provided by the "hardy-backports" project. I added a backports task to this bug for you, but like Jamie said, these are not officially supported by the ubuntu-security team so it will depend on a community member who's interested in fixing it to take a look.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
