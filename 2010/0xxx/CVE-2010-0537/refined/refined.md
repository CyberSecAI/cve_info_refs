- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A path resolution issue in DesktopServices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A path resolution vulnerability allows for a multi-stage attack, where a user is tricked into mounting an arbitrarily named share via a URL scheme.  When saving a file using the default save panel, and using "Go to folder" or dragging folders to the save panel, the data may be unexpectedly saved to the malicious share.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can gain access to user data by tricking the user into saving files to a malicious share.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker first entices a user to mount an arbitrarily named share via URL scheme, then the user saves files to the mounted malicious share using "Go to folder" or drag/drop on a file save dialog.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to entice the user to mount a malicious share, which can be done through a URL scheme.
