Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-0807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has already been deleted from memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free condition, where the browser attempts to operate on memory that has been deallocated, leading to memory corruption.
- **Memory Corruption:** The attempt to access a deleted object leads to memory corruption, paving the way for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system, with the same privileges as the logged-on user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install software, modify/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Web Page:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious web page designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites/Content:** Attackers can leverage compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content to deliver malicious payloads.
- **Embedded ActiveX Control:** An ActiveX control embedded in a document (e.g., a Microsoft Office document) could be used to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring prior authentication.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on convincing victims to visit a malicious website or open a compromised document to trigger the exploit.
- **Technical Expertise:** Crafting the malicious webpage or object requires technical expertise.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as affecting the way Internet Explorer accesses a deleted object.

**Mitigation:**
- Microsoft has released a security update (MS10-018) to address the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- Users should install the latest updates for their browser to mitigate this vulnerability.

**Affected Software:**
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 7

**Non-Affected Software**
- Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, and Internet Explorer 8 are not affected by this vulnerability.
