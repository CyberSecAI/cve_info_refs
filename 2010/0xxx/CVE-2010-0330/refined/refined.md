*   **Information Disclosure / Path Traversal:** This vulnerability exists in the following extensions:
    *   Photo Book
    *   SB Folderdownload
    *   kiddog\_mysqldumper

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in insecure coding practices within the third-party extensions. These practices include:

*   Failure to sanitize user inputs, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   Improper handling of user-supplied data, resulting in XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Lack of proper access control and input validation, leading to information disclosure and path traversal issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities varies:

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of data, or complete control of the application.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users, leading to hijacking user sessions, stealing sensitive information, or defacing websites.
*  **Information Disclosure/ Path Traversal**: Attackers could gain access to sensitive data on the server and may be able to access files outside of the intended directories

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors for these vulnerabilities generally involve:

*   Manipulating user inputs that are not properly sanitized.
*   Injecting malicious scripts into vulnerable fields.
*   Exploiting the lack of proper access control and input validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers need to identify vulnerable extensions used on a TYPO3 instance.
*   For SQL Injection, attackers need to be able to manipulate input data sent to the server.
*   For XSS, attackers need to inject code, typically through input fields or other user-controllable data.
*   For information disclosure, they need to find ways to trigger the faulty code within the extension.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that many of the vulnerable extensions have been removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository because the maintainers could not be contacted or failed to provide fixes. Users are advised to uninstall these extensions and delete the files.
*   The advisory also recommends following the guidelines in the TYPO3 Security Cookbook and subscribing to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security updates.
