Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way browsers handle cross-domain CSS loading, specifically:

*   **Permissive CSS Parsing:** Browsers, in an attempt to be lenient and handle incorrectly configured servers, ignore the MIME type of a fetched resource when processing CSS. They also parse CSS even if it's embedded within other content like HTML, JSON, or XML, ruthlessly hunting for CSS constructs.
*   **Cross-Domain Cookie Transmission:** Browsers send cookies with cross-domain CSS requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **MIME Type Ignoring:** Browsers don't enforce the correct MIME type for CSS resources, making them vulnerable to parsing content that is not actually CSS.
*   **CSS Parsing within Non-CSS Content:** The CSS parser will process CSS even when embedded in HTML or other data types.
*   **Cross-domain cookie leakage:** Cookies are sent with cross-domain CSS requests, allowing attackers to potentially steal sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Domain Data Theft:** Attackers can inject CSS within content on the victim's domain, which is then parsed when the attacker loads a stylesheet cross-domain. This allows the attacker to extract data from the victim's domain by embedding the stolen data within the URL of a background-image request. The stolen information can be any content that precedes a valid CSS string.
*   **Anti-CSRF Token Theft:** If the stolen data includes anti-CSRF tokens or other sensitive values, the attacker can use them to perform actions on behalf of the user. In the example provided, the attacker was able to obtain the "mid" values for emails, which acted as anti-CSRF tokens, enabling them to delete emails.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially steal any information that is present on the victim's page.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, attackers could inject specially crafted CSS, which can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the vulnerable web application, depending on the browser's implementation and other factors. (This is not explicitly discussed as a primary vector but mentioned in a comment referencing another vulnerability).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSS Injection:** The attacker injects a CSS string within a field on the victim's domain. This can be done through various means, such as:
    *   Email Subject lines, comments, social media posts, etc., where user-generated content is displayed without proper sanitization.
    *   JSON/XML API endpoints or feeds where data is reflected back to users without escaping.
*   **Cross-Domain CSS Request:** The attacker loads a CSS file cross-domain, triggering the parsing of the injected CSS string and the extraction of the victim's data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over CSS Injection Point:** The attacker needs to be able to inject a CSS string, or a string that can be interpreted as CSS, into a portion of the victim's domain that the victim's browser will render or fetch as part of a resource (e.g., email subject).
*   **Ability to Load Cross-Domain CSS:** The attacker needs to be able to load a CSS resource from the victim's domain.
*   **Web Server:** The attacker requires a web server to receive and log the stolen data, which is exfiltrated in the background-image URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post emphasizes that the vulnerability is in browser standards and not necessarily a failure of a specific web application.
*   The attacker needs to have control over two injection points, before and after the desired data.
*   Newlines in the injected string will break the CSS parsing. Also, quoting with single (') or double (") quotes, if properly escaped in the target context (HTML, URL, etc), can prevent successful injection.
*   The vulnerability affects all major browsers and can be exploited with JavaScript disabled.
*   The SUSE Security Summary Report (SUSE-SR:2010:014) mentions that Opera was patched for this issue and refers to CVE-2010-0653.
