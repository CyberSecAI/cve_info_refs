{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a memory corruption issue when Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution with the same privileges as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system, potentially installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, or creating new accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can create a specially crafted web page that exploits the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.",
       "The attacker can also take advantage of compromised websites or websites hosting malicious content."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host or distribute a specially crafted web page that can be viewed by a user with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. Social engineering or other techniques can be used to convince the user to visit the page. No user interaction is required beyond the victim visiting the malicious page.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is one of several addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-002. The vulnerability is related to how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Data Execution Protection (DEP) may help in mitigating the vulnerability but is not a complete solution."
