{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the way Microsoft Office Visio handles memory when opening specially crafted Visio files. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by how Visio validates attributes when processing these files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory corruption due to improper attribute validation when handling specially crafted Visio files."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution, gaining the same user rights as the local user. This can lead to complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Opening a specially crafted Visio file received via email.",
    "Visiting a malicious website hosting a specially crafted Visio file, and then opening the malicious file."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Visio file. They also need to either convince a user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious website that hosts the file."
