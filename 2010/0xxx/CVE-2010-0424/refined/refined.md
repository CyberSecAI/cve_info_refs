Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how `vixie-cron` and `cronie` handle the setting of the modification timestamp of a user's crontab file during editing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition that occurs when the crontab file's timestamp is being updated while the file is being edited. This allows for a potential attacker to manipulate the timestamp value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can potentially manipulate the timestamp of various system files, leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability is not considered high severity, but is still a security issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker must have a shell on the system to exploit the race condition when crontab is being edited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   They would need to be able to manipulate the crontab file while the system attempts to update the file's timestamp.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of `vixie-cron` in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.
*   The vulnerability also affects `cronie` in Fedora 11 and 12.
*   The issue was reported by Dan Rosenberg.
*   Red Hat assigned a low severity rating to this vulnerability.
*   Updates were released to address the vulnerability in Fedora 11, 12 and 13
*   Red Hat also released RHSA-2012:0304 to address this vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
