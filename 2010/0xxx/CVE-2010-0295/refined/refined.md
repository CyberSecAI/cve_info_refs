Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from lighttpd's inefficient memory allocation when handling slow requests. Instead of appending incoming data to existing buffers, it allocates new buffers for each read, even if the amount of data received is minimal (e.g., a single byte).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Inefficient Memory Allocation:** The core issue is allocating new buffers instead of reusing or appending to existing ones. This leads to excessive memory consumption.
- **Lack of Input Buffering:** The server does not effectively buffer incoming data, resulting in a 4KB or 16KB buffer allocation for each small chunk of data.
- **Trusting Backends:** lighttpd trusts backends and attempts to read data as quickly as possible, which can amplify the memory usage issue if backends send large files.
- **SSL_read requirement ignorance**: The fix for the vulnerability in 1.4.x involves ignoring the requirement to pass the same buffer to SSL_read in subsequent calls after SSL_ERROR_WANT*, relying on the fact it worked in 1.5.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS by sending slow, byte-by-byte requests. This can exhaust the server's memory, rendering it unresponsive.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** The server's memory is consumed rapidly, potentially crashing the server or affecting other services running on the same machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Slow HTTP Requests:** The primary attack vector involves sending HTTP requests at an extremely slow rate, such as one byte per second.
- **Parallel Requests:** Sending multiple slow requests concurrently exacerbates the problem and accelerates memory exhaustion.
- **Exploiting SSL**: The vulnerability is also present with SSL connections as well if a system does not support FIONREAD
- **Abuse of backends**: Large files sent by the backend can also lead to high memory usage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable lighttpd server.
- **Ability to Control Request Rate:** The attacker must be able to control the rate at which they send data. Sending very slowly triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability affects lighttpd versions prior to 1.4.26
- The fix involves appending to the previous buffer if it is still in the raw-in queue and packing the buffers if they get moved to the next queue.
- The fix in 1.4.x ignores a SSL_read requirement, relying on the fact this has been working in 1.5 for a long time.

This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2010-0295.
