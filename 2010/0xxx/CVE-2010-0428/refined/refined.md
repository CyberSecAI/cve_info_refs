```
{
  "CVE-2010-0428": {
    "Root cause": "The libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient guest provided pointers validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A privileged guest user could cause the host to dereference an invalid pointer, leading to a guest crash (denial of service) or potentially privilege escalation on the host.",
    "Attack vectors": "A privileged user within a guest virtual machine can send crafted data via the QXL graphics card driver.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a privileged user account within a guest virtual machine."
  }
