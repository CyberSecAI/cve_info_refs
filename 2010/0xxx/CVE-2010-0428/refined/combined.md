# RHSA-2010:0633 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: qspice security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0633)

## Topic

Updated qspice packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is a
remote display protocol used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux for viewing
virtualized guests running on the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
hypervisor, or on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not
validate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card
driver. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to
dereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of
service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating
their privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be
forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses
controlled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on
the host. (CVE-2010-0429)

All qspice users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=568699#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-02-26 12:09:54 UTC  ``` Izik Eidus found a bug in QEMU that allows priviledged guest user to touch arbitrary memory in the hosting QEMU process. The bug is in QXL/libspice code. Guest and host share region of memory and use it to communicate with each other. Malicious user can use the lack of validation of pointers embedded into data structures in this memory area to touch host's abitrary memory location and/or make the hosting QEMU process crash by dereferencing invalid pointer.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=568699#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:26:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0633 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0633.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=568699#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:45:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0622 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0622.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=568699#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-02-26 12:09:54 UTC  ``` Izik Eidus found a bug in QEMU that allows priviledged guest user to touch arbitrary memory in the hosting QEMU process. The bug is in QXL/libspice code. Guest and host share region of memory and use it to communicate with each other. Malicious user can use the lack of validation of pointers embedded into data structures in this memory area to touch host's abitrary memory location and/or make the hosting QEMU process crash by dereferencing invalid pointer.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=568699#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:26:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0633 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0633.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=568699#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:45:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0622 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0622.html>   ``` |  |

# RHSA-2010:0622 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated rhev-hypervisor packages that fix multiple security issues and two
bugs are now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not
validate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card
driver. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to
dereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of
service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating
their privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be
forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses
controlled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on
the host. (CVE-2010-0429)

It was found that QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers
provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver. A privileged guest
user could use this flaw to cause the host to dereference an invalid
pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly,
resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-0431)

A flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the
index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO
initialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the
guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-2784)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found when Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor was run on a system that has a processor with the
Intel VT-x extension enabled. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
to trick the host into emulating a certain instruction, which could crash
the host (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0435)

A flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker
could trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,
preventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.
(CVE-2010-2811)

These updated packages provide updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for avahi issues
CVE-2009-0758 and CVE-2010-2244; freetype issues CVE-2010-1797,
CVE-2010-2498, CVE-2010-2499, CVE-2010-2500, CVE-2010-2519, CVE-2010-2527,
and CVE-2010-2541; kernel issues CVE-2010-1084, CVE-2010-2066,
CVE-2010-2070, CVE-2010-2226, CVE-2010-2248, CVE-2010-2521, and
CVE-2010-2524; and openldap issues CVE-2010-0211 and CVE-2010-0212.

These updated rhev-hypervisor packages also fix two bugs. Documentation for
these bug fixes will be available shortly from
<http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
fixes from the KVM update RHSA-2010:0627 have been included in this update.
Also included are the bug fixes from the VDSM update RHSA-2010:0628.

KVM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html> VDSM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0628.html>

Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to these updated rhev-hypervisor packages, which resolve these
issues.
