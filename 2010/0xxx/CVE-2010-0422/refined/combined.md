How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Steps to reproduce:  1) Lock screen 2) Move mouse to removable monitor 3) hit escape key to cancel unlock dialog 4) move mouse to bring up unlock dialog on new head 5) unplug monitor 6) quickly hit keys on the keyboard  At this point gnome-screensaver will either crash, or show a black screen.  If it shows a black screen then hitting "alt-f2" and then typing "pkill -f gnome-screensaver" will bring you to the session. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=609337#c1)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2010-02-08 16:02:32 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 153272](attachment.cgi?id=153272 "Migrate lock dialog and keyboard grab to attached head when they would otherwise get dropped") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=153272&action=edit "Migrate lock dialog and keyboard grab to attached head when they would otherwise get dropped") [[review]](review?bug=609337&attachment=153272) Migrate lock dialog and keyboard grab to attached head when they would otherwise get dropped  <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=a5f66339be6719c2b8fc478a1d5fc6545297d950> <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=dcca89b7ab6e1220815af38da246434b2e13fd9f> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=609337#c2)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2010-02-08 16:03:24 UTC  ``` Downstream report: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-0414> ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c0)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2010-02-12 20:13:25 UTC  ``` gnome-screensaver can lose its keyboard grab when locked, exposing the system to intrusion by adding and removing monitors.  This issue is similar to but different than [bug 609337](show_bug.cgi?id=609337 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - when installing control-center I get parser spew.") ([CVE-2010-0414](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0414))  Steps to reproduce:  1) Lock screen 2) Plug in new monitor and wait for unlock dialog to show on it. 3) Unplug new monitor, watch unlock dialog move to primary monitor 4) Replug new monitor, watch unlock dialog stay on primary monitor 5) Unplug new monitor 6) hit alt-f2 and type "pkill -f gnome-screensaver"   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c1)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2010-02-12 20:16:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 390573](attachment.cgi?id=390573&action=diff "patch to fix the problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=390573&action=edit "patch to fix the problem") patch to fix the problem   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-02-12 20:17:57 UTC  ``` As with the other similar issue, this one only affects gnome-screensaver 2.28, so only Fedora 12 is affected.  Please use [CVE-2010-0422](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0422) for this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c4)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2010-02-12 22:13:27 UTC  ``` Fixes are upstream here:  <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=d4dcbd65a2df3c093c4e3a74bbbc75383eb9eadb> <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=271ae93d7b140b8ba40d77f9e4ce894e5fd1b554> <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=f93a22c175090cf02e80bc3ee676b53f1251f685>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c5)  Matt McCutchen    2010-02-13 07:20:17 UTC  ``` Wow, gnome-screensaver's hold on the X session is more fragile than I would have expected.  It makes me wish the X server would give us more help securely locking the screen and perhaps keeping it locked even if gnome-screensaver crashes ("fail-secure").   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c6)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-16 13:07:25 UTC  ``` gnome-screensaver-2.28.3-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c7)  Akshay Dua    2010-03-14 22:21:11 UTC  ``` This problem is still not fixed for me. I am using the latest version: gnome-screensaver-2.28.3-1.fc12. I have a Thinkpad X61 that I use on a docking station most of the time. The docking station has another monitor (Viewsonic VP191b) connected to it. Whenever I disconnect my laptop from the dock and connect it back again, the lock dialog shows up on the laptop screen but I can't type the password into it. The mouse and cursor don't appear at all.  I work around the problem by waiting for the "Time expired" message to show up on the lock dialog. After which, the screen goes dark and then, I can move the mouse to get a fully functional lock dialog back on my laptop screen.  Its also worth noting that every time I disconnect the laptop from the docking station, I get the following error message in a notification dialog "Could not switch the monitor configuration. Could not set the configuration for CRT 56"  Any help will be appreciated.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c8)  Matt McCutchen    2010-03-14 22:47:35 UTC  ``` Re [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c7): "This problem" is the vulnerability described in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c0).  Unless you are reporting that the vulnerability still exists, please file a separate bug.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=564464#c9)  Akshay Dua    2010-03-14 22:53:56 UTC  ``` oops! my apologies, I'll file a separate bug.   ``` |  |

A similar issue was also just found.  We have assigned CVE-2010-0422 to
the new flaw that is similar to this.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=564464>
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=609789>

There are links to the upstream commits in the gnome bug report.

As with the previous issue, this one also only affects version 2.28.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
