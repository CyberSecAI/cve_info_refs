| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-12 10:34:43 UTC  ``` Dan Rosenberg found a buffer overflow flaw in the way TeX text formatting system processed virtual font files. If a user was tricked into processing a specially-crafted typesetter-independent .dvi (DeVice Independent) file, it could lead to dvips executable crash or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running dvips.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-12 10:36:49 UTC  ``` This issue affects with limited impact the versions of the tetex package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 By processing specially-crafted DVI file this version of tetex launches the "emergency stop" trigger, which prevents the denial of service (dvips crash).  This issue affects the version of the tetex package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  This issue does NOT affect the version of the tetex package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 due to applied FORTIFY SOURCE protection, which detects the attack and terminates the particular process prior it can do something harmful.  This issue does NOT affect the versions of the texlive package, as shipped with Fedora release of 11 and 12 due to applied FORTIFY SOURCE protection.  For further information regarding FORTIFY SOURCE feature, please proceed to:   [1] <http://www.redhat.com/magazine/009jul05/features/execshield/#checks>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-15 15:43:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 400247](attachment.cgi?id=400247&action=diff "patch from upstream to correct the flaw") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=400247&action=edit "patch from upstream to correct the flaw") patch from upstream to correct the flaw  Upstream patch from Karl Berry to correct this flaw.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-04-13 12:43:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 406226](attachment.cgi?id=406226&action=diff "Updated patch from Karl Berry") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=406226&action=edit "Updated patch from Karl Berry") Updated patch from Karl Berry   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c12)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-04-22 12:25:25 UTC  ``` Public via:   [1] <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0827>   [2] <http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/dvipsk/ChangeLog?view=log>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 18:54:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0399 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0399.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 19:10:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2010:0401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0401.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2010-05-10 09:06:19 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:   <http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=17560>   ``` |  |

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-12 10:34:43 UTC  ``` Dan Rosenberg found a buffer overflow flaw in the way TeX text formatting system processed virtual font files. If a user was tricked into processing a specially-crafted typesetter-independent .dvi (DeVice Independent) file, it could lead to dvips executable crash or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running dvips.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-12 10:36:49 UTC  ``` This issue affects with limited impact the versions of the tetex package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 By processing specially-crafted DVI file this version of tetex launches the "emergency stop" trigger, which prevents the denial of service (dvips crash).  This issue affects the version of the tetex package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  This issue does NOT affect the version of the tetex package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 due to applied FORTIFY SOURCE protection, which detects the attack and terminates the particular process prior it can do something harmful.  This issue does NOT affect the versions of the texlive package, as shipped with Fedora release of 11 and 12 due to applied FORTIFY SOURCE protection.  For further information regarding FORTIFY SOURCE feature, please proceed to:   [1] <http://www.redhat.com/magazine/009jul05/features/execshield/#checks>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-15 15:43:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 400247](attachment.cgi?id=400247&action=diff "patch from upstream to correct the flaw") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=400247&action=edit "patch from upstream to correct the flaw") patch from upstream to correct the flaw  Upstream patch from Karl Berry to correct this flaw.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-04-13 12:43:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 406226](attachment.cgi?id=406226&action=diff "Updated patch from Karl Berry") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=406226&action=edit "Updated patch from Karl Berry") Updated patch from Karl Berry   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c12)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-04-22 12:25:25 UTC  ``` Public via:   [1] <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0827>   [2] <http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Build/source/texk/dvipsk/ChangeLog?view=log>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 18:54:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0399 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0399.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 19:10:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2010:0401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0401.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=572914#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2010-05-10 09:06:19 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:   <http://www.tug.org/svn/texlive?view=revision&revision=17560>   ``` |  |

Fixed packages have been prepared long before the public announcement
of [CVE-2010-1440](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1440) anbd the security team informed about the lcoation
of the packages that where ready for upload. I couldn't do it myself
since I was offline.
(my email was from 1 May 2010, to security@debian.org)

It looks that at the security side of Debian nobody cared about me contacting
them about this issue (PING PING PING!!! any answer???)

Anyway, I have now myself upload 2009-6 of texlive-binaries and at the
same time an upload fixing the same issues for stable (into
stable-proposed-updates as discussed on the security list).

Anyway, thanks for your work.

Closing the two bugs since I did *NOT* rebuild the packages just to
add two bug numbers.

Best wishes

Norbert

dvips: VF fallback to OFM for (u)pTeX

The rule for virtual fonts (VF) fallback is extended:
If a VF has no entry of a codepoint and the first
MAPFONT designates an OFM for (u)pTeX, then we designate the
glyph (usually with a fullwidth metric) of the same codepoint
with the same metrics of the codepoint in the OFM.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [texlive-bin](/security/cves?package=texlive-bin) -

## Details

It was discovered that TeX Live incorrectly handled certain long .bib

bibliography files. If a user or automated system were tricked into

processing a specially crafted bib file, an attacker could cause a denial

of service via application crash. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS,

9.04 and 9.10. ([CVE-2009-1284](/security/CVE-2009-1284))

Marc Schoenefeld, Karel Šrot and Ludwig Nussel discovered that TeX Live

incorrectly handled certain malformed dvi files. If a user or automated

system were tricked into processing a specially crafted dvi file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-0739](/security/CVE-2010-0739), [CVE-2010-1440](/security/CVE-2010-1440))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that TeX Live incorrectly handled certain

malformed dvi files. If a user or automated system were tricked into

processing a specially crafted dvi file, an attacker could cause a denial

of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0827](/security/CVE-2010-0827))

The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- evolution-data-server
- evolution considered S/MIME signatures to be valid even for modified
mails (CVE-2009-0547: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.
