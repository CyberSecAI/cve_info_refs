{
  "CVE-2010-0625": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by parsing malformed arguments to the RMD, RNFR, and DELE commands within the Novell Netware NWFTPD daemon, which can lead to stack-based buffer overflows.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable Novell Netware server. This can lead to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malformed arguments to the RMD, RNFR, or DELE FTP commands.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FTP server and must be able to authenticate or leverage the default anonymous access. No special user privileges are needed beyond basic FTP access.",
      "Additional Details": "The vulnerability occurs due to overly long parameters in the mentioned commands, causing a buffer overflow."
