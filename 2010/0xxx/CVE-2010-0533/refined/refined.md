- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A directory traversal issue exists in the path validation for AFP shares.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability in AFP share path validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote user with guest access to an AFP share may enumerate the parent directory of the share root, and read or write files within that directory that are accessible to the 'nobody' user.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access to an AFP share with guest access enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote user with guest access to an AFP share.
