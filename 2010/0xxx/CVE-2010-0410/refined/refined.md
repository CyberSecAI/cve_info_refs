{
  "CVE-2010-0410": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the kernel connector implementation. A local, unprivileged user could trigger this flaw by sending an arbitrary number of notification requests using specially-crafted netlink messages, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel did not correctly handle netlink connector messages.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The code in drivers/connector/connector.c allows users to send/allocate arbitrary amounts of NETLINK_CONNECTOR messages to the kernel.",
      "Lack of proper input validation in handling netlink connector messages."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this to consume kernel memory, leading to a denial of service. This can result in system crashes, killing processes or halting the system due to OOM (Out-of-Memory) conditions.",
    "attack_vector": "A local, unprivileged user can send arbitrary amounts of crafted netlink messages.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local unprivileged user.",
