{
  "CVE-2010-0731": {
    "description": "The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates in GnuTLS used an incorrect integer type for extracting a certificate's serial number. On 64-bit big-endian architectures, this could result in bypassing Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checks.",
    "root_cause": "The `gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial()` function in GnuTLS incorrectly passed a `size_t` (64-bit on 64-bit platforms) pointer to `asn1_read_value()`, which expected a pointer to an `int` (32-bit). This caused the function to read the wrong length value leading to a failure to detect an error which caused downstream buffer overflows.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect type passed to function leading to an error condition that was not checked",
      "Stack buffer overflow in print_x509_info() and print_certificate_info() due to the incorrect length value",
      "CRL check bypass due to incorrect serial number processing in `gnutls_x509_crt_check_revocation()`"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service, or potentially allow attackers to bypass certificate revocation checks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious X.509 certificates",
       "Network-based attacks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to present a malicious X.509 certificate to a vulnerable system, which could occur via network connections or by local file handling. Additionally, the attacker needs to be on a big-endian 64-bit architecture for the CRL bypass vulnerability."
