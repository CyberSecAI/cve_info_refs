## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution (975416)

Published: February 09, 2010

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves six privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003, and Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by changing the way that Microsoft Office PowerPoint and Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer parse specially crafted PowerPoint files.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 975416](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/975416) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Why is the Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer 2003 not being offered an update package?**

The Vulnerability FAQ for CVE-2010-0033 states that this update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way that Microsoft Office PowerPoint Viewer parses specially crafted PowerPoint files; however, no update package for the standalone PowerPoint Viewer 2003 is offered.

This is because standalone installations of the PowerPoint Viewer 2003 are [past their support life cycle](https://blogs.technet.com/office_sustained_engineering/archive/2008/12/09/excel-viewer-2003-word-viewer-2003-and-powerpoint-viewer-2003-to-retire.aspx) and will not be offered this update. Instead, this update is being offered to customers of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 so that they may issue their updated version of their presentations created using the [Package a Presentation for CD feature](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/828504) in PowerPoint which uses PowerPoint Viewer 2003.

It should be a priority for customers who have standalone installations of the PowerPoint Viewer 2003 to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. PowerPoint Viewer 2007 is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin and is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=048dc840-14e1-467d-8dca-19d2a8fd7485&displaylang;=en).

**MS10-003 also describes a vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac. How does MS10-003 relate to this bulletin (MS10-004)?**

As part of the cumulative servicing model for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, this security update for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB979674) also addresses the vulnerability described in MS10-003. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac installed will have to install this security update but will only need to install it once.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335.](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0032](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0032).

#### Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint OEPlaceholderAtom Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0032

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for PowerPoint OEPlaceholderAtom Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0032

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  + For Office 2003 Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]
    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special âexempt directoryâ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922847](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922847) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  + For Office 2003 Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]
    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000
* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  [Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:

  </https:>[https:](https://)

  To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats:

| Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- | --- |
| ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show | ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8 |
| ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template | ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow |
| ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow | ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8 |

**Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, the commands above will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the 2.0 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/q:u** | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user. |
| **/q:a** | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user. |
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files. |
| **/c** | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/r:n** | Never restarts the system after installation. |
| **/r:I** | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**. |
| **/r:a** | Always restarts the system after installation. |
| **/r:s** | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user. |
| **/n:v** | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. **Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
