NetBSD Security Advisory 2010-003
=================================
Topic: azalia(4)/hdaudio(4) negative mixer index panic
Version: NetBSD-current: affected prior to 2010-01-21
NetBSD 5.0.\*: affected
NetBSD 5.0: affected
NetBSD 4.0.\*: affected
NetBSD 4.0: affected
Severity: Local system crash
Fixed: NetBSD-current: Jan 21, 2010
NetBSD-5-0 branch: Jan 22, 2010
NetBSD-5 branch: Jan 22, 2010
NetBSD-4-0 branch: Jan 22, 2010
NetBSD-4 branch: Jan 22, 2010
Please note that NetBSD releases prior to 4.0 are no longer supported.
It is recommended that all users upgrade to a supported release.
Abstract
========
A signedness issue in the azalia(4) and hdaudio(4) drivers allows a
local attacker to cause a kernel panic.
Technical Details
=================
The azalia\_query\_devinfo() function in azalia(4) and the
hdaudio\_afg\_set\_port() function in hdaudio(4) incorrectly assume
the mixer index to be an unsigned integer, thus not checking for
negative values. Since the mixer index number is user specified,
any user with access to the mixer can cause an access to a negative
array index by specifying a negative mixer number, leading to a
kernel panic.
In order to exploit the vulnerability, the azalia(4) or hdaudio(4)
driver must be loaded and at least one azalia(4) or hdaudio(4)
device must be present in the machine and configured by the kernel
Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
As a possible workaround, the azalia(4) and hdaudio(4) drivers can
be disabled. This can be achieved either by specifying the
configuration parameter at boot and disabling the device:
boot> boot -c
config> disable azalia
config> disable hdaudio
config> boot
or by commenting out the relevant sections of your kernel configuration
file:
#azalia\* at pci? dev ? function ? # High Definition Audio
#hdaudio\* at pci? dev ? function ? # High Definition Audio
The following instructions describe how to upgrade your kernel
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of the kernel.
Only kernels compiled with either of the following options are
vulnerable to this issue:
azalia\* at pci? dev ? function ?
hdaudio\* at pci? dev ? function ?
As a temporary workaround recompile the kernel with the above option
commented out. The default NetBSD GENERIC kernels have the azalia
option enabled, while hdaudio is disabled.
For all NetBSD versions, you need to obtain fixed kernel sources,
build, install the new kernel, and reboot the system.
The fixed source may be obtained from the NetBSD CVS repository.
The following instructions briefly summarise how to upgrade your
kernel. In these instructions, replace:
ARCH with your architecture (from uname -m), and
KERNCONF with the name of your kernel configuration file.
To update from CVS, build, and install the kernel:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P sys/dev/pci/azalia.c
# cvs update -d -P sys/dev/pci/hdaudio/hdaudio\_afg.c # Except on NetBSD 4.x
# ./build.sh kernel=KERNCONF
# mv /netbsd /netbsd.old
# cp sys/arch/ARCH/compile/obj/KERNCONF/netbsd /netbsd
# shutdown -r now
For more information on how to do this, see:
http://www.NetBSD.org/guide/en/chap-kernel.html
Thanks To
=========
Pierre Pronchery for finding and reporting the vulnerability as well as
providing a patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
