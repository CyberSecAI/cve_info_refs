[ MacOS X 10.6.3 filesystem hfs Denial of Service Vulnerability ]
Author: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
Date:
- - Dis.: 01.04.2010
- - Pub.: 23.04.2010
CVE: CVE-2010-0105
Risk: Medium
Affected Software:
- - MacOS 10.6 (tested on 1062 and 1063)
NOTE: Prior versions may also be affected.
- --- 0.Description ---
Mac OS is the trademarked name for a series of graphical user interface-based operating systems developed by Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) for their Macintosh line of computer systems. The Macintosh user experience is credited with popularizing the graphical user interface. The original form of what Apple would later name the "Mac OS" was the integral and unnamed system software first introduced in 1984 with the original Macintosh, usually referred to simply as the System software.
- --- 1. MacOS X 10.6.3 filesystem hfs Denial of Service ---
The main problem exist in implementation of filesystem (hfs). MacOS X 10.6.3 has default hfs filesystem, so the problem came, when we create a special structure with hardlinks.
Interesting information is in wikipedia :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard\_link
- ---
...
Most modern operating systems don't allow hard links on directories to prevent endless recursion. A notable exception to this is Mac OS X v10.5 (Leopard) which uses hard links on directories for the Time Machine backup mechanism only.
...
- ---
In 10.6 we can't use ln(1) command to create hardlink to directory (example: # ln C/C CX ). Anyway, we can use link(3) function and we don't need any special privileges! It hear nice to exploit it.. let's try
To show this issue, we need use this program:

This DoS will be localized in phase

Now we need create PATH\_MAX/2 directory tree to make overflow.

The above program last.c, creates a structure:
C / C / C / C / C / C / C / ..
C / C / CX
C / C / C / C / CX
...
until maxopenfiles limit or ax<20000. But we don't need create so deep tree (example hfs\_poc.c).
To present last.c, we will use \_www(70) user and apache child as a main process.

apache child has created C directory and CX hardlink.
Programs such as:

are not able to repair the partition where is the directory "CX".

This example has been created with -3000 fts level. so we don't need create a very deepth tree (min ~512).
let's try remove C and CX directory (created by last.c).
xs-Mac:hardstyle x$ sudo rm -rf C
rm: C: Directory not empty
xs-Mac:hardstyle x$ sudo rm -rf CX
xs-Mac:hardstyle x$
we can't use rm(1) to simple remove C directory (exploit - last.c). We need divide this process for a few phases.
It is not easy to delete the directory C, however some relationships can completely prevent it. Let's look at the mechanism maxopenfiles and try execute "last" a several times.

Irregular call to chdir(3) function, is the result of restrictions maxopenfiles at the time.
So multiple execution of last.c, prevents our struct before destroing.
How deep will come our program, depends on the number of open files on the system.
The use of entropy in establishing the structure, can completely prevent, the removal of a defective structure.
Let's see what google know about
"Maximum nesting of folders and directory hard links reached"
http://www.google.pl/#hl=pl&source=hp&q="Maximum+nesting+of+folders+and+directory+hard+links+reached"
Nobody has ever complained of similar problems.
Let's look at:
...
if (dfs.depth >= DIRLINK\_DFS\_MAX\_DEPTH) {
fsckPrint(gptr->context, E\_DirHardLinkNesting);
if (fsckGetVerbosity(gptr->context) >= kDebugLog) {
print\_dfs(&dfs);
}
gptr->CatStat |= S\_LinkErrNoRepair;
retval = E\_DirHardLinkNesting;
}
...
where
...
/\* Assuming that the name of a directory is single byte, the maximum depth
\* of a directory hierarchy that can accommodate in PATH\_MAX will be
\* PATH\_MAX/2. Note that catalog hierarchy check puts limitation of 100
\* on the maximum depth of a directory hierarchy.
\*/
#define DIRLINK\_DFS\_MAX\_DEPTH PATH\_MAX/2
...
When we overskip PATH\_MAX/2, interesting line is:
gptr->CatStat |= S\_LinkErrNoRepair;
The user \_www is able to give flag S\_LinkErrNoRepair :)
- --- 2. Fix ---
Currently not available.
The last vulnerability CVE-2009-0689 was removed in version 10.6.3 (after 9 months). So we have to wait
