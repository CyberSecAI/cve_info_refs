3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

patch - handle all combinations of inline and block flow when splitting and merging ruby bases
As described in the ChangeLog, the ruby code so far did not anticipate block flow in ruby bases. This caused an illegal type cast and subsequently the crash.
The new code covers all combinations when splitting and merging ruby bases.

patch - cleaned up version of previous patch, even more layout tests
Cleaned up version of the previous patch. Also adds a line that was missing in the previous patch and removes an incorrect ASSERT.
Adds 6 more layout tests (14 in total) in order to try to even better cover all possibilities.

A purple mac ews means that your bugzilla account is not listed in committers.py:
<http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/WebKitTools/Scripts/webkitpy/committers.py>
Just change that string to an array of strings, one of which is your bugzilla (@google) address, and it will work fine.
You can also change this account's email address to be @chromium in <https://bugs.webkit.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=account>

This looks okay.

Typo. Should be “malformed”.

> +{
> + for (RenderObject\* child = children()->firstChild(); child; child = children()->firstChild())
Existing loops that iterate over children while removing them store the pointer to the current child’s next sibling before moving it, then make the stored sibling the current child. I wonder if that’s more efficient that calling children()->firstChild().
> + // RenderRubyBase needs to do some complex block manipulation.

I wish this could be avoided. And the comment isn’t helpful.
> + if (childrenInline())
> + moveChildrenFromInlineFlow(toBase, beforeChild);

> + moveChildrenFromBlockFlow(toBase, beforeChild);
Following the naming scheme used in RenderBlock, I would name these methods moveInlineChildren() and moveBlockChildren(). This is always a block flow.
> + // If toBase has a suitable block, we re-use it, otherwise create a new one.
> + RenderBlock\* block;

Braces around a single-line clause.
Should you check that !lastChild->parent()->createsAnonymousWrapper()? Can you assert that?
> + for (RenderObject\* child = firstChild(); child != beforeChild; child = firstChild())
> + moveChildTo(block, block->children(), child);
Perhaps you can unify this loop with the similar loop at the end of the “if” clause.
> + if (beforeChild != firstChild()) {
You can rewrite this with an early return.
> + if (firstChildHere && firstChildHere->isAnonymousBlock() && firstChildHere->childrenInline() &&
> + lastChildThere && lastChildThere->isAnonymousBlock() && lastChildThere->childrenInline() ) {
Please move the && to the beginning of the second line, and remove the space before the last parenthesis.
> + for (RenderObject\* child = anonBlockHere->firstChild(); child; child = anonBlockHere->firstChild())
> + anonBlockHere->moveChildTo(anonBlockThere, anonBlockThere->children(), child);
This looks like moveAllChildrenTo().
r- because of the createsAnonymousWrapper() question, function naming (using “block flow” and “inline flow” instead of “block children” and “inline children”) and the style issues.

patch - addressing the review remarks
Changed the patch as requested, in particular:
-) Changed moveAllChildrenTo() to use original coding with 2 variables. I don't think there'd be any speed difference, but then again safe is safe... ;)
-) Renamed methods as suggested, refactored moveInlineChildren() as suggested
-) Changed method signatures to use RenderRubyBase\* instead of the more generic RenderBlock\*. This should also address the question about createsAnonymousWrapper (?).
-) about braces around a single line clause: ISTR there was a discussion on webkit-dev@ that that's ok if it's consistent between the if and the else clause (?). But I'm not religious about such things, so I removed them anyway.

[Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=33266#c9)
2010-01-19 02:42:50 PST

Addendum:
I'm also not too happy introducing a 'friend' clause into RenderBlock, but that was the smallest and least intrusive change I could think of to pacify the compiler about those "anonBlock->..." operations.
Making moveChildTo, moveAllChildrenTo and makeChildrenNonInline public is probably a no-no.
So the remaining option would be to make makeChildrenNonInline protected and add a clearAnonymousBlock() method in RenderBlock, or - perhaps better - add a RenderAnonymousBlock class that contains this and is used for anonymous block wrappers in general (which would be a good idea IMHO).
(Any other possibilities I'm missing?)

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Bug 33266 - WebCore::InlineFlowBox::determineSpacingForFlowBoxes ReadAV@NULL (43c64e8abbda6766e5f5edbd254c2d57)

([​https://bugs.webkit.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=33266](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33266))

Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

WebCore:

Ruby did not handle malformed cases correctly when the ruby base was in

block flow. Changed the code to handle all possible cases.

Also, added some simplification methods to RenderBlock.

Tests: fast/ruby/ruby-illegal-1.html

LayoutTests:

Layout tests for ruby with malformed HTML.

Split up in individual tests, as well ass added a single combined test

(whose resulting render tree is probably completely different from what

you'd expect), since that combined test showed additional issues not

covered by the individual tests.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
