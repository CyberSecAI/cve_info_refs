How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE-2010-0010: Apache mod\_proxy vulnerability

After contact with Apache security team i can publish new advisory. This bug exists only in apache 1.3 version in mod\_proxy modules, only in 64 bits architecture.

I would like to thanks Colm MacCárthaigh – the guy responsible for contact with me and patch this hole.

Bugfix ﻿is available in a forthcoming version of Apache 1.3.x.

If you have any question just contact with me. Advisory is avaible [here](http://site.pi3.com.pl/adv/mod_proxy.txt):

```
Name:                      Mod_proxy from apache 1.3 - Integer overflow which causes heap overflow.
Author:                    Adam Zabrocki (<pi3@itsec.pl> or <zabrocki@cern.ch>)
Date:                      Jan 27, 2010

   Issue:

Mod_proxy from apache 1.3.xx (tested on latest version - 1.3.41) allows local and remote attackers
to overflow buffer on heap via integer overflow vulnerability.

   Description:

Mod_proxy implements a proxy/cache for Apache. It implements proxying capability for FTP, CONNECT (for SSL),
HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and (as of Apache 1.3.23) HTTP/1.1. The module can be configured to connect to other
proxy modules for these and other protocols.

   Details:

Let's look in code:

"./src/modules/proxy/proxy_util.c"
long int ap_proxy_send_fb(BUFF *f, request_rec *r, cache_req *c, off_t len, int nowrite, int chunked, size_t recv_buffer_size)
{

...
    size_t buf_size;
    long remaining = 0;
...

    for (end_of_chunk = ok = 1; ok;) {
...
        if (chunked) {
            long chunk_start = 0;
            n = 0;

            /* start of a new chunk */
            if (end_of_chunk) {
                end_of_chunk = 0;
                /* get the chunk size from the stream */
                chunk_start = ap_getline(buf, buf_size, f, 0);    <----------------  [0] reading line from traffic (socket)
                if ((chunk_start <= 0) || ((size_t)chunk_start + 1 >= buf_size) || !ap_isxdigit(*buf)) {
                    n = -1;
                }
                /* parse the chunk size */
                else {
                    remaining = ap_get_chunk_size(buf);           <----------------  [1] convert readed data to 'long' size!
                    if (remaining == 0) { /* Last chunk indicated, get footers */
...
...
                        }
                    }
                    else if (remaining < 0) {
                        n = -1;
                        ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_DEBUG|APLOG_NOERRNO, r,
                                      "proxy: remote protocol error, invalid chunk size");
                    }
                }
            }

            /* read the chunk */
            if (remaining > 0) {
                n = ap_bread(f, buf, MIN((int)buf_size, (int)remaining));     <------------- [2] convert 'long' to 'int' !!!!
                if (n > -1) {
                    remaining -= n;
                    end_of_chunk = (remaining == 0);
                }
            }
...
...
}

OK. We have simple flow in this code:

-> server read header
-> if it is chunked connection
  -> [0] server will wait and then read data from socket (size of the chunk)
  -> simple check what server received
  -> [1] convert received data to 'long' type
  -> if there is possitive chunk size
     -> [2] directly convert 'long' to 'int' type    <- here is integer overflow bug in amd64 architecture !!!
     -> copy data using converted type

Vulnerability exists only in 64 bits architectures when server directly convert 'long' type to 'int'.
On 64 bits architectures:
   long - 8 bytes
   int  - 4 bytes

When we have conversion from 'long' to 'int' in 64 bits architectures, directly is removed lower 4 bytes.

OK. Let's find calls to this vulnerable function:
./src/modules/proxy/proxy_cache.c:            ap_proxy_send_fb(c->origfp, r, c, c->len, 1, 0, IOBUFSIZE);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy_cache.c:            ap_proxy_send_fb(c->origfp, r, c, c->len, 1, 0, IOBUFSIZE);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy_cache.c:        ap_proxy_send_fb(c->origfp, r, c, c->len, r->header_only, 0, IOBUFSIZE);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy_cache.c:        ap_proxy_send_fb(cachefp, r, NULL, c->len, 0, 0, IOBUFSIZE);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c:            ap_proxy_send_fb(data, r, c, -1, 0, 0, conf->io_buffer_size);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c:        ap_proxy_send_fb(f, r, c, c->len, 0, chunked != NULL,

I was testing mod_proxy for http configuration. How it works in details?

client ---------> Server  < -- (mod_proxy_XXX) -- > Other server
                   ^
                   |
                   |
                   -> CACHE (proxy cache)

Proof of Concept which I attached to this advisory causes vulnerability in connection:
                Server < ---- > Other server
... but as we can see (calls to vuln function) probably there is some opportunity
to trigger this vulnerability from CACHE (proxy cache).

In real world this vulnerability is dangerous for open proxy servers. In pentesting could be useful
to attack server behind other servers... but... everyone knows probably better vectors :)

   Does it exist in 32bit systems? I tried to reproduce this in 32bit CentOS 5.4 and it was impossible. Any ideas?

   Hi Marc!

   This bug exists only on 64 bits architecture and this is reason why you can’t reproduce it on 32 bits CentOS 5.4

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- glib2
The when copying symbolic links the g\_file\_copy function set the
target of the link to mode 0777 therefore exposing potentially
sensitive information or allowing other user to modify files they
should not have access to (CVE-2009-3289).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- mediawiki
MediaWiki was prone to a CSS validation flaw and data leakage
vulnerability (CVE-2010-1189, CVE-2010-1190).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- apache
Specially crafted requests could lead to an integer overflow in
mod\_proxy. Attackers could exploit that to crash apache or
potentially cause execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2010-0010).
The problem only affects 64bit architectures.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

Name: Mod\_proxy from apache 1.3 - Integer overflow which causes heap overflow.
Author: Adam Zabrocki ( or )
Date: Jan 27, 2010
Issue:
Mod\_proxy from apache 1.3.xx (tested on latest version - 1.3.41) allows local and remote attackers
to overflow buffer on heap via integer overflow vulnerability.
Description:
Mod\_proxy implements a proxy/cache for Apache. It implements proxying capability for FTP, CONNECT (for SSL),
HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and (as of Apache 1.3.23) HTTP/1.1. The module can be configured to connect to other
proxy modules for these and other protocols.
Details:
Let's look in code:
"./src/modules/proxy/proxy\_util.c"
long int ap\_proxy\_send\_fb(BUFF \*f, request\_rec \*r, cache\_req \*c, off\_t len, int nowrite, int chunked, size\_t recv\_buffer\_size)
{
...
size\_t buf\_size;
long remaining = 0;
...
for (end\_of\_chunk = ok = 1; ok;) {
...
if (chunked) {
long chunk\_start = 0;
n = 0;
/\* start of a new chunk \*/
if (end\_of\_chunk) {
end\_of\_chunk = 0;
/\* get the chunk size from the stream \*/
chunk\_start = ap\_getline(buf, buf\_size, f, 0); <---------------- [0] reading line from traffic (socket)
if ((chunk\_start <= 0) || ((size\_t)chunk\_start + 1 >= buf\_size) || !ap\_isxdigit(\*buf)) {
n = -1;
}
/\* parse the chunk size \*/
else {
remaining = ap\_get\_chunk\_size(buf); <---------------- [1] convert readed data to 'long' size!
if (remaining == 0) { /\* Last chunk indicated, get footers \*/
...
...
}
}
else if (remaining < 0) {
n = -1;
ap\_log\_rerror(APLOG\_MARK, APLOG\_DEBUG|APLOG\_NOERRNO, r,
"proxy: remote protocol error, invalid chunk size");
}
}
}
/\* read the chunk \*/
if (remaining > 0) {
n = ap\_bread(f, buf, MIN((int)buf\_size, (int)remaining)); <------------- [2] convert 'long' to 'int' !!!!
if (n > -1) {
remaining -= n;
end\_of\_chunk = (remaining == 0);
}
}
...
...
}
OK. We have simple flow in this code:
-> server read header
-> if it is chunked connection
-> [0] server will wait and then read data from socket (size of the chunk)
-> simple check what server received
-> [1] convert received data to 'long' type
-> if there is possitive chunk size
-> [2] directly convert 'long' to 'int' type <- here is integer overflow bug in amd64 architecture !!!
-> copy data using converted type
Vulnerability exists only in 64 bits architectures when server directly convert 'long' type to 'int'.
On 64 bits architectures:
long - 8 bytes
int - 4 bytes
When we have conversion from 'long' to 'int' in 64 bits architectures, directly is removed lower 4 bytes.
OK. Let's find calls to this vulnerable function:
./src/modules/proxy/proxy\_cache.c: ap\_proxy\_send\_fb(c->origfp, r, c, c->len, 1, 0, IOBUFSIZE);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy\_cache.c: ap\_proxy\_send\_fb(c->origfp, r, c, c->len, 1, 0, IOBUFSIZE);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy\_cache.c: ap\_proxy\_send\_fb(c->origfp, r, c, c->len, r->header\_only, 0, IOBUFSIZE);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy\_cache.c: ap\_proxy\_send\_fb(cachefp, r, NULL, c->len, 0, 0, IOBUFSIZE);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy\_ftp.c: ap\_proxy\_send\_fb(data, r, c, -1, 0, 0, conf->io\_buffer\_size);
./src/modules/proxy/proxy\_http.c: ap\_proxy\_send\_fb(f, r, c, c->len, 0, chunked != NULL,
I was testing mod\_proxy for http configuration. How it works in details?
client ---------> Server < -- (mod\_proxy\_XXX) -- > Other server
^
|
|
-> CACHE (proxy cache)
Proof of Concept which I attached to this advisory causes vulnerability in connection:
Server < ---- > Other server
... but as we can see (calls to vuln function) probably there is some opportunity
to trigger this vulnerability from CACHE (proxy cache).
In real world this vulnerability is dangerous for open proxy servers. In pentesting could be useful
to attack server behind other servers... but... everyone knows probably better vectors :)
