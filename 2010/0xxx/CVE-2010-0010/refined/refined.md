  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow vulnerability in the mod_proxy module of Apache 1.3.x on 64-bit architectures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow when converting a 'long' type to an 'int' type, which leads to a heap overflow.",
      "Improper handling of chunked transfer encoding in `ap_proxy_send_fb` function."
    ],
    "impact": "Heap overflow leading to potential crashes or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted chunked transfer-encoded HTTP response through a vulnerable proxy server, with a chunk size that triggers the integer overflow.",
        "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by exploiting an open proxy server configuration."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted chunked HTTP response to a vulnerable proxy server, or have the ability to manipulate the backend response."

    "affected_versions": "Apache 1.3.xx, specifically tested on 1.3.41. Only affects 64-bit architectures",
    "code_location": "./src/modules/proxy/proxy_util.c in the `ap_proxy_send_fb` function.",
      "poc_details": "A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit sends a chunked HTTP response with a chunk size of `10000000FFFF0000` which, when converted from a long to an int, causes a negative value, leading to heap corruption.",
