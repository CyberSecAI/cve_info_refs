# Security

At Flock, we take security very seriously. We use the best industry practices available to make sure that Flock is secure.

![SOC 2 Compliant](https://www.flock.com/hubfs/Flock_April2019/images/soc2-03d8f833.png)
##### SOC 2 Compliant

Flock is now SOC 2 compliant. This means Flock follows very strict, best-in-class, audited processes to ensure the safety and integrity of user information.

### Data Encryption

All traffic between Flock clients and servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2, the industry standard for securing communications over the Internet. AES is our preferred cipher for encrypting all communication, and where available, perfect forward secrecy is used to protect against compromise of long-term private keys.

### Data Centre Security

Our servers are hosted in the cloud by Amazon's AWS web services. The AWS cloud infrastructure is designed for security, constantly monitored, highly available and highly accredited. More details can be found on the [AWS Cloud Security Page.](https://aws.amazon.com/security/)

### Privacy

#### Messages

One of our driving principles with regards to privacy is that any message that you send on Flock should only be visible to participants in that conversation and no one else. As a result, no third person can access messages exchanged in a one-to-one conversation, and only members of a private channel have access to messages exchanged in that private channel.

#### Profile Data

Apart from your name and profile picture, which is available to the public, all other profile data is only visible to users within your organisation.

#### Privacy Policy

For details, please [refer to our privacy policy.](https://support.flock.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004312874)

### Software Security

#### Secure by Design

All our software is designed from the ground up to be secure. Care has been taken to minimise impact in case a security vulnerability is discovered.

#### Security Assurance

Our security assurance process ensures that security requirements have been established for all software used in Flock, whether on the client or on the server. Security requirements are established for software development and operations & maintenance processes. Each code review includes an evaluation of the security requirements. We regularly perform an evaluation of software security and requirements.

### Employee Access

Strict controls have been placed over employees' access to user data. From time to time, for debugging purposes, we might need to access sensitive user data. Any such access only takes place after obtaining consent from the affected users, and an audit entry is generated for each access. A very limited number of employees have permission to access sensitive user data.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
