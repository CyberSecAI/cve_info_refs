-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Advisory: avast! 4.8 and 5.0 aavmker4.sys Kernel Memory
Corruption
Advisory ID: TKADV2010-003
Revision: 1.0
Release Date: 2010/02/22
Last Modified: 2010/02/22
Date Reported: 2010/02/01
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: avast! 4.8 <= 4.8.1368.0
avast! 5.0 < 5.0.418.0
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
Vendor URL: http://www.avast.com
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
Patch development time: 10 days
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
The kernel driver aavmker4.sys shipped with avast! 4.8 and 5.0 contains a
vulnerability in the code that handles IOCTL requests. Exploitation of this
vulnerability can result in:
1) local denial of service attacks (system crash due to a kernel panic), or
2) local execution of arbitrary code at the kernel level (complete system
compromise)
The issue can be triggered by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request.
No special user rights are required to exploit the vulnerability.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
The IOCTL call 0xb2d60030 of the aavmker4.sys kernel driver shipped with
avast! 4.8 and 5.0 accepts user supplied input that doesn't get validated
enough. In consequence it is possible to overwrite arbitrary kernel space
and user space memory addresses with arbitrary values. This can be
exploited to control the kernel execution flow and to execute
arbitrary code at the kernel level.
Disassembly of aavmker4.sys (avast! 4.8, file version 4.8.1356.0):
[..]
.text:00010E46 [1] cmp eax, 0B2D60030h ; vulnerable IOCTL

.text:00010F0F [3] cmp esi, 878h ; InputBufferSize == 0x878?
.text:00010F15 jz short loc\_10F21
[..]
[1] Vulnerable IOCTL
[2] EDI now points to user controlled IOCTL input data
[3] The size of the IOCTL input data must be equal to 0x878
[..]
.text:00010F21 loc\_10F21:
.text:00010F21 and [ebp+var\_4], 0
.text:00010F25 cmp dword ptr [edi], 0
.text:00010F28 jz loc\_10FC5
.text:00010F2E [4] mov esi, [edi+870h]
.text:00010F34 mov [ebp+v34\_uc], esi
.text:00010F37 mov eax, ds:MmUserProbeAddress
.text:00010F3C [5] cmp esi, [eax] ; user space or kernel space?
.text:00010F3E jnb short loc\_10F46
[..]
[4] If the input size equals 0x878 a pointer value gets extracted from the
user supplied IOCTL input data and saved in ESI
[5] It is checked if ESI points into user space or kernel space
[..]
.text:00010F46 loc\_10F46:
.text:00010F46 push esi ; VirtualAddress
.text:00010F47 [6] call ds:MmIsAddressValid
.text:00010F4D test al, al
.text:00010F4F jz short loc\_10F5F
.text:00010F51 lea eax, [esi+8]
.text:00010F54 push eax ; VirtualAddress
.text:00010F55 [7] call ds:MmIsAddressValid
.text:00010F5B test al, al
.text:00010F5D jnz short loc\_10F65
[..]
[6] + [7] If ESI points to an address in kernel space it is checked if ESI
and ESI+8 are pointing to valid memory addresses
[..]
.text:00010F65 loc\_10F65:
.text:00010F65 [8] mov eax, [esi]
.text:00010F67 mov [ebp+v32\_uc], eax
.text:00010F6A [9] mov esi, [esi+4]
.text:00010F6D mov [ebp+var\_4C], esi
.text:00010F70 [10] xor [ebp+v32\_uc], 55667788h
.text:00010F77 [11] xor esi, 11223344h
.text:00010F7D mov [ebp+var\_4C], esi
.text:00010F80 mov eax, dword\_125E8
.text:00010F85 [12] cmp eax, [ebp+v32\_uc] ; check pattern1
.text:00010F88 jnz short loc\_10F93
.text:00010F8A mov eax, dword\_125EC
.text:00010F8F [13] cmp eax, esi ; check pattern2
.text:00010F91 jz short loc\_10F99
[..]
[8] + [9] If the addresses are valid, EAX and ESI are filled with data
from the user defined kernel space address (pointed to by ESI)
The first value (EAX) is xor'ed with 0x55667788 (see [10]) and then
compared with the value 0x85B8DA8F found at dword\_125E8 (see [12]).
.data:000125E8 dword\_125E8 dd 85B8DA8Fh
The second value (ESI) is xor'ed with 0x11223344 (see [11]) and then
compared with the value 0x198E3FE found at dword\_125EC (see [13]).
.data:000125EC dword\_125EC dd 198E3FEh
If both patterns match, the following code gets executed:
[..]
.text:00010F99 loc\_10F99:
.text:00010F99 xor edx, edx
.text:00010F9B mov eax, [ebp+v34\_uc]
.text:00010F9E mov [eax], edx
.text:00010FA0 mov [eax+4], edx
.text:00010FA3 lea esi, [edi+4] ; src
.text:00010FA6 mov ecx, 21Ah ; len
.text:00010FAB mov edi, [eax+18h] ; dst
.text:00010FAE [14] rep movsd ; memcpy
[..]
The memcpy function at [14] gets called with the following parameters:
memcpy (EDI, ESI, ECX);
EDI (dst): this value is extracted from a user defined kernel space address
ESI (src): points to user controlled IOCTL input data
ECX (len): 0x21A
Vulnerability:
If an attacker were able to (temporarily) store user controlled data at a
user defined address in kernel space, the check at [5] could be passed and
the memcpy() call would lead to an exploitable memory corruption condition.
Unfortunately, the aavmker4.sys driver supports at least one IOCTL that
allows an unprivileged user to temporarily store arbitrary data at a known
kernel space address.
Exploitation:
STEP 1: Use one of the IOCTLs supported by aavmker4.sys to temporarily
store arbitrary data at a known kernel space address (e.g. the IOCTL
0xb2d6001c). This data has to start with the two patterns that are checked
at [12] and [13].
STEP 2: Send a request to the vulnerable IOCTL. Store a pointer at offset
0x870 of the IOCTL data that points to the kernel space address of STEP 1.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
