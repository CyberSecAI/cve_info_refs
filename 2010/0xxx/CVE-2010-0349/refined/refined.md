**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send the crafted malicious input to a user of the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Low technical skills are required to perform the attack, as it is a standard XSS attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects WebCalenderC3 version 0.32 and earlier.
- The vendor was unable to reproduce the vulnerability, but released a security enhanced version to mitigate the risk.
