  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a double-free condition within the libpr0n library when handling animations received via the multipart/x-mixed-replace mimetype. Specifically, when the bits-per-pixel of an image frame changes, the application frees a pointer and can be made to reuse this freed pointer later.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper handling of image frame reuse during bit-per-pixel changes in multipart/x-mixed-replace animations.",
       "Dangling pointer dereference vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page containing crafted multipart/x-mixed-replace images.",
      "Opening a malicious file containing crafted multipart/x-mixed-replace images."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page or file that sends specially crafted image data using multipart/x-mixed-replace mimetype, which triggers the vulnerable code path when a bits-per-pixel change is encountered.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability lies within the libpr0n library, used by Mozilla Firefox for image caching and animation. The vulnerability is triggered when a new image frame with a different bits-per-pixel value is received by the application through the multipart/x-mixed-replace mimetype. This causes the application to free a pointer related to the old frame and later reuse it when processing the new frame. This leads to a double-free condition and memory corruption that can be exploited to execute code. User interaction is required in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."
