{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `HyleosChemView.ocx` ActiveX control of Hyleos ChemView 1.9.5.1.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is triggered when an overly long string is passed to the `SaveAsMolFile()` method of the ActiveX control, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed remotely by embedding malicious HTML containing the vulnerable ActiveX control and a JavaScript payload that triggers the overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious HTML file (e.g., through a phishing attack). The user must have the vulnerable Hyleos ChemView ActiveX control installed and enabled in their browser."
