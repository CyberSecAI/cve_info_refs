{
  "CVE-2010-0427": {
    "description": "Sudo failed to properly reset group permissions, when \"runas_default\" option was used. If a local, unprivileged user was authorized by sudoers file to perform their sudo commands under default user account, it could lead to privilege escalation.",
    "root_cause": "Sudo did not properly reset group permissions when the `runas_default` configuration option was used.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect privilege management",
      "Improper handling of supplementary group memberships"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user could escalate their privileges by gaining access to group memberships they should not have, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user specified with `runas_default`.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged user authorized to use sudo with the `runas_default` option set in the sudoers file. The attacker needs to be able to execute commands through sudo."
