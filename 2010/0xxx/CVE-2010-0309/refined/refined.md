  "CVE-2010-0309": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation in KVM. Access to the internal data structure pit_state, which represents the data state of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit_ioport_read() function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.",
    "root_cause": "Improper validation of access to the internal data structure `pit_state` in the `pit_ioport_read()` function of the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation within KVM.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Improper access control"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service on the host system by crashing it.",
    "attack_vector": "A local attacker in a guest virtual machine can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have privileged access within a guest virtual machine to send crafted requests to the PIT. Specifically by reading from /dev/port.",
    "additional_details": "The `pit_ioport_read` function used the address of the PIT register as an index into the `pit_state->channels[]` array, which has a fixed size of 3, and this improper access allowed the guest OS to read (and potentially write) into memory outside the intended buffer, crashing the host OS. The PIT control word (address 0x43) is write-only, reads are undefined, but not properly handled."
