Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-0682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stemmed from a lack of proper access control checks for trashed posts/pages in WordPress. When a post or page was moved to the trash, it was still accessible to logged-in users who knew the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system failed to enforce restrictions on accessing trashed content, allowing logged-in users to view them directly if they had the URL.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information in trashed posts/pages, which were not meant to be publicly accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Access:** An attacker could gain access to content that was intended to be deleted or hidden, potentially leading to exposure of confidential information.
- **Privacy Violation:** The privacy of users could be violated if their trashed content became accessible to other logged-in users who shouldn't have access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** An attacker would need to know or guess the URL of a trashed post/page to exploit the vulnerability. This could be through bookmarking a page before it's trashed, or through a leak of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in User:** The attacker must have a valid user account and be logged into the WordPress site to exploit this flaw.
- **URL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the trashed post/page they intend to access.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability was initially reported in WordPress Trac as ticket #11236 by user "caesarsgrunt" and was later independently reported by Thomas Mackenzie.
- The fix was implemented in changeset [13117] and [13118], which added a check for edit capabilities to prevent logged-in users from viewing trashed content.
- The issue was resolved in WordPress 2.9.2, a security release specifically addressing this and other related bugs.
