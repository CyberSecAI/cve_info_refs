How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [The short memory of WordPress.org security](https://hakre.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/the-short-memory-of-wordpress-org-security/)

Posted on [16 Feb 2010](https://hakre.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/the-short-memory-of-wordpress-org-security/ "10:18 am") by [hakre](https://hakre.wordpress.com/author/hakre/ "View all posts by hakre")

***For the wordpress project it’s said: If you find a bug, report it. That’s the same if it is security related.** For those who feel – for whatever reason – uncomfortable to publicize it in [trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ "wordpress bug tracker") directly, can shoot an email to [security@wordpress.org](http://codex.wordpress.org/Security_FAQ). So trac is not the only option. But it is one.*

But do not think that if you report a security related bug, that it will get fixed sooner or later. For example, the bug related to last years wordpress worm was open for a very long time. Even after it has been reported for months (and from what I’ve read in the sourcecode this bug must have been known for even longer). A patch had been provided but it took about four month or so after it finally got committed. That was a public report. If I remember correctly, no correct credits were given for the report and fix. A full report on that issue is still missing, I might write about it in a blog-post on it’s own.

But there is no need to go back into the past for such a long period. See the latest fix that resulted in the release of 2.9.2, it’s out fresh. On the [blog on wordpress.org it was stated yesterday](http://wordpress.org/development/2010/02/wordpress-2-9-2/) on february 15th 2010:

> Thomas Mackenzie alerted us to a problem where logged in users can peek at trashed posts belonging to other authors.

I do not doubt that that guy alerted them – but so did other reporters long ago my memory reminded me. A quick search in wordpress trac revealed a bugreport that is perfectly the same issue: [#11236: Trashed pages can still be opened when logged in](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11236). Reported about 3 months ago!

Is it the reporter’s responsibility to reference the earlier report and reporter? Well, in respect of prior art, he should have better done to not look like a blunder. I mean, it just might be the case that Mckenzie had read the ticket and created his “genuine” report afterwards, right? Not that I want to accuse him that he did, but who knows? How to deal with the doubts here? You can’t so it’s always better to reference and give credits – in case you are aware.

Is it the wordpress.org’s blog poster responsibility to reference the earlier report and credit the reporter? I must admit that this looks even more blunderish, because core developers have reviewed that original report long time ago. No offence to Ryan here who normally does a great job coding, but wordpress.org is only referencing Mr. Mackenzie in the blog post. Just a missing information here or lack of research prior to publishing? In a rush for a fix?

Just to say it here now, the issue was reported by [caesarsgrunt](http://profiles.wordpress.org/caesarsgrunt) / [Caesar’s Grunt](http://www.caesarsgrunt.com/). WordPress.Org [should update the blogpost for correctness sake](http://wordpress.org/development/2010/02/wordpress-2-9-2/). If only. Something has gone wrong.

   Hey.

   If I am 100% honest with you here I didn’t know this existed, reason being is that the problem wasn’t named how I myself would name it.

   In regards to what you have written here I understand if your upset that this was fixed under my name etc and not the name of the original finder. However the reason I think it was is that I spent a long time going over my finding, I wrote the advisory and also got help from Ryan to write the PoC. I took screenshots of the problem, and I emailed them instead of releasing it on trac.

   Again I am sorry if in your eye me getting the credit was wrong. However I am sure you can appreciate that I didn’t realise that anyone had found it, and I put a lot of hours in trying to emulate the problem on local networks and VM’s so that I could prove and get WP to understand the problem.

     Hey, I do not think that it is your problem what was litereally written on wordpress.org nor that the information was unavailable upfront. It’s just hard to tell afterwards, that’s all. And you clarified it now so I do not think that this is a “real” problem.

     When I remember the discussions months ago correctly I think mainly it was argumented that the bug is not that “bold” that it needs a fix. So this is more or less a problem with the people behind wordpress security and not you (I need to include myself in there as well because I did not analyze the issue 100% correct in the original ticket while commenting it).

     If you and ryan put efforts into it to get it covered and fixed now then it’s every user who has to thank you both for doing some work as well as to thank the original reporter. I know there are a lot of issues reported in trac and it is not easy to find out if something has been already reported or not. Not everybody writing in there has English as first language to say at least.

   Well I am glad that has got cleared up. i am sorry for any confusion that this all may have coursed, like I have said I have written a blog post on my website about the original founder of the bug and really that is all I can do.

   Thanks for the quick reply Hakre, and I will be sure to keep checking out your blog and put it in my RSS.

    From reading the ticket, it doesn’t appear to have been seen as a security issue at the time. Which is why it was worded the way it was.

      I do not want to blame the original reporter for doing the actual bug report. I won’t say you do either but the line is thin in that argumentation, if you take the following into account:

      From reading the blog post and the Mackenzie report, it doesn’t appear that it would have been too hard for wordpress security to search/browse core-trac for trash/Component prior to announcing.

      I mean there might be multiple causes why it happened what happened. The questions should be, are we able to deal with the deficiencies like Thomas, and how can we do better next time?

      Spoken in the way-of-escaping-sense, maybe WP in 3.0 will move from kindergarten to preschool. Let’s see how much backwards compat the big ball is going to take until it breaks. [13357] only to have it in here.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Description

Pages in the trash can still be visited, assuming that you know the URL (eg you bookmarked it before the page was trashed). This should not be possible; a 404 error should be returned.

Ah. This is only so if the user is logged in, as with Pending/Draft posts. It still shouldn't be visible really, though.

401 Error might be valid as well (gone). Since trash is a 2.9 feature and it looks like that someone just had forgotten to complete it, it should be fixd in 2.9 as well.

Is there a concept on how to deal with trashed items? I mean this can be the same for trashed pages and/or trashed links, categories etc. pp.. Which items are trashable anyway?

Even better: A message could be displayed: This item was trashed. Do you want to undo this / delete forever this ?

Replying to [hakre](/ticket/11236#comment:4 "Comment 4"):

I think you mean 410 Gone. 401 is Unauthorized.

Yes, 410 is a valid response too, and might be better than 404. However, only if the post was previously published.

I don't think the message is a good idea in the frontend.

> I don't think the message is a good idea in the frontend.

I misread the ticket, I thought this was about the post editor (backend).

---

Was able to reproduce. Trashed post is accessible as long as still logged in. Not-logged-in users will get a "Sorry, no posts matched your criteria." message (default theme).

The related function *have\_posts()* is returning true even for a trashed page. That function relies on wp\_query->get\_posts() (query.php line 1564-2387). You must have passed at least the mid-term exam of the WP-Query Sience before you're allowed to write a patch for that 823-lined-function. Because of that I assume this will never get fixed. So I suggest wontfix right away.

### [#8](#comment:8) [@dd32](https://profiles.wordpress.org/dd32) [15 years](/timeline?from=2009-12-27T02%3A19%3A11Z&precision=second "See timeline at 12/27/2009 02:19:11 AM") ago

* **Keywords**
  *dev-feedback* added; *needs-patch* removed
* **Milestone**
  set to *Future Release*

See also [#11546](/ticket/11546 "#11546: defect (bug): Trash Feature does not hide posts (closed: worksforme)")

For front end queries, IMO ideally WP\_Query wouldnt return trash posts for privledged accounts. Except looking at this again, Its not included in the results.. Just when queried direectly?

However, There is the possibility that users may want that, for example, take a wiki plugin, trashed posts would want to be available for moderators on the front end.

The question boils down to: Since privledged accounts can see it in the back end, does that mean they should be able to access it on the front end as well? If so, Adding a Trashed: prefix to the title (Like Private and Protected) would be a mid-ground to mention to the users the reasoning.

Milestone: All open tickets need a milestone.

dev-feedback pending on the user experience of trashed posts on the front end?

Inface priviledged accounts can see it in the frontend if they know the URL. just for correctness so that this does not get mixxed.

Mate.... I think most are quite aware of that given thats what this damn ticket is about? Please read the tickets before commenting, and while i'm at it please dont link every damn ticket to another that mentions a similar word its getting old

Looks like that this has been fixed with a patch / changeset. [[13117]](/changeset/13117 "Add trash to edit cap check.")? Can the original fix-commiting developer please reference it? Must be pre the 2.9.2 [[13165]](/changeset/13165 "2.9.2") / [[13164]](/changeset/13164 "Bump"). Maybe ryan?
