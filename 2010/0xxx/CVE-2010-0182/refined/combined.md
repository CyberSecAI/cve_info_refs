- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# USN-921-1: Firefox 3.5 and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

9 April 2010

Firefox 3.5 and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.5](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.5) -
* [xulrunner-1.9.1](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.1) -

## Details

Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, Jesse Ruderman, and Ehsan Akhgari discovered

flaws in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing

a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2010-0173](/security/CVE-2010-0173), [CVE-2010-0174](/security/CVE-2010-0174))

It was discovered that Firefox could be made to access previously freed

memory. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0175](/security/CVE-2010-0175),

[CVE-2010-0176](/security/CVE-2010-0176), [CVE-2010-0177](/security/CVE-2010-0177))

Paul Stone discovered that Firefox could be made to change a mouse click

into a drag and drop event. If the user could be tricked into performing

this action twice on a crafted website, an attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2010-0178](/security/CVE-2010-0178))

It was discovered that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module as used by the Firebug

add-on could be used to escalate privileges within the browser. If the user

had the Firebug add-on installed and were tricked into viewing a malicious

website, an attacker could potentially run arbitrary JavaScript.

([CVE-2010-0179](/security/CVE-2010-0179))

Henry Sudhof discovered that an image tag could be used as a redirect to

a mailto: URL to launch an external mail handler. ([CVE-2010-0181](/security/CVE-2010-0181))

Wladimir Palant discovered that Firefox did not always perform security

checks on XML content. An attacker could exploit this to bypass security

policies to load certain resources. ([CVE-2010-0182](/security/CVE-2010-0182))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [xulrunner-1.9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.1)
  -
  [1.9.1.9+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.1/1.9.1.9%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)
* [firefox-3.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.5)
  -
  [3.5.9+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.5/3.5.9%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0500)

## Topic

An updated firefox package that addresses security issues, fixes bugs, adds
numerous enhancements, and upgrades Firefox to version 3.6.4, is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2010-1121, CVE-2010-1200, CVE-2010-1202, CVE-2010-1203)

A flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for
a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2010-1198)

Several integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed
web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. (CVE-2010-1196, CVE-2010-1199)

A focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A
malicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,
such as usernames and passwords. (CVE-2010-1125)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the "Content-Disposition:
attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
also present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the
"Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent content from being
displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content
to users. (CVE-2010-1197)

A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could
be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different
websites. (CVE-2008-5913)

A flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.
Certain security checks were not being called when an XML document was
loaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load
certain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its
add-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML
document. (CVE-2010-0182)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 3.6.4. You can find a link to the Mozilla advisories
in the References section of this erratum.

This erratum upgrades Firefox from version 3.0.19 to version 3.6.4, and as
such, contains multiple bug fixes and numerous enhancements. Space
precludes documenting these changes in this advisory. For details
concerning these changes, refer to the Firefox Release Notes links in the
References section of this erratum.

Important: Firefox 3.6.4 is not completely backwards-compatible with all
Mozilla Add-ons and Firefox plug-ins that worked with Firefox 3.0.19.
Firefox 3.6 checks compatibility on first-launch, and, depending on the
individual configuration and the installed Add-ons and plug-ins, may
disable said Add-ons and plug-ins, or attempt to check for updates and
upgrade them. Add-ons and plug-ins may have to be manually updated.

All Firefox users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
Firefox version 3.6.4. After installing the update, Firefox must be
restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

firefox security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2010-0500)

Original Release Date: June 25, 2010

Last Revised: July 7, 2011

Number: ASA-2010-165

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1121](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1121.html), [CVE-2010-1200](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1200.html), [CVE-2010-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1202.html) and [CVE-2010-1203](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1203.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for
a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1198](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1198.html) to this issue.

Several integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed
web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1196](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1196.html) and [CVE-2010-1199](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1199.html) to these issues.

A focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A
malicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,
such as usernames and passwords. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1125](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1125.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the "Content-Disposition:
attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
also present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the
"Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent content from being
displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content
to users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1197](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1197.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could
be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different
websites. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-5913](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2008-5913.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.
Certain security checks were not being called when an XML document was
loaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load
certain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its
add-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML
document. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-0182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0182.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0500.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using RHEL4 with the affected version of firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 2.0 including 2.0 SP1 and 2.0 SP2 | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 5.2.2 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

nsXMLDocument::load() will do same-origin checks on the URL to be loaded but won't check content policies. I think it should call content policies with TYPE\_XMLHTTPREQUEST and use calling document as context.

I guess I can take this. Not sure if using TYPE\_XMLHTTPREQUEST is ok. I agree it's conceptually the same, i just worry that people expect to be able to get to an XHR object.Assignee: nobody → jonas

In the old code, lack of codebase is not equal to system principal!

Attached patch

[Patch v2](attachment.cgi?id=429272&action=diff)

Turns out that the first patch breaks a bunch of mochitests. The problem is that if we use the document itself as context, the nsDataDocumentContentPolicy content policy blocks the load. Instead we should using the \*calling\* document as the context.
This patch does that.
