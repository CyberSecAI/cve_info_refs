  "related": true,
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_aa1f8586_20250125_214542.html",
      "rootCause": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site.",
        "An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \"safe for initialization\" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine.",
        "The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements."
      ],
       "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, or by opening an attachment sent through e-mail."
