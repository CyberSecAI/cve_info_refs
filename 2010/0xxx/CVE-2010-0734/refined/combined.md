## Synopsis

Moderate: curl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0329)

## Topic

Updated curl packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

cURL is a tool for getting files from FTP, HTTP, Gopher, Telnet, and DICT
servers, using any of the supported protocols. cURL is designed to work
without user interaction or any kind of interactivity.

Wesley Miaw discovered that when deflate compression was used, libcurl
could call the registered write callback function with data exceeding the
documented limit. A malicious server could use this flaw to crash an
application using libcurl or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. Note:
This issue only affected applications using libcurl that rely on the
documented data size limit, and that copy the data to the insufficiently
sized buffer. (CVE-2010-0734)

Users of curl should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue. All running applications using
libcurl must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2023-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Steffen Joeris
March 28, 2010                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : curl
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2010-0734

Wesley Miaw discovered that libcurl, a multi-protocol file transfer
library, is prone to a buffer overflow via the callback function when
an application relies on libcurl to automatically uncompress data. Note
that this only affects applications that trust libcurl's maximum limit
for a fixed buffer size and do not perform any sanity checks themselves.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.18.2-8lenny4.

Due to a problem with the archive software, we are unable to release all
architectures simultaneously. Binaries for the hppa, ia64, mips, mipsel
and s390 architectures will be provided once they are available.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 7.20.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny

Debian (stable)

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

Message-ID: <4B716FFF.4010909@redhat.com>
Date: Tue, 09 Feb 2010 15:23:59 +0100
From: Jan Lieskovsky <jlieskov@...hat.com>
To: oss-security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>
CC: "Steven M. Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>
Subject: CVE Request -- cURL/libCURL 7.20.0

Hi Steve, vendors,

   cURL upstream has released latest v7.20.0 version of cURL/libCURL
fixing the "libcurl data callback excessive length" issue.

References:
[1] <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html#20100209>
[2] <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20100209.html>
[3] <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-contentencoding.patch>
[4] <http://curl.haxx.se/download.html>

Mitigation factors (from [1]):

"This error is only present in zlib-enabled builds of libcurl and only if
  automatic decompression has been explicitly enabled by the application - it
  is disabled by default."

Could you allocate CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

# USN-1158-1: curl vulnerabilities

24 June 2011

Multiple vulnerabilities in curl.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [curl](/security/cves?package=curl) - HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

## Details

Richard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication,

libcurl unconditionally performs credential delegation, handing the

server a copy of the client's security credential. ([CVE-2011-2192](/security/CVE-2011-2192))

Wesley Miaw discovered that when zlib is enabled, libcurl does not

properly restrict the amount of callback data sent to an application

that requests automatic decompression. This might allow an attacker to

cause a denial of service via an application crash or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privilege of the application. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-0734](/security/CVE-2010-0734))

USN 818-1 fixed an issue with curl's handling of SSL certificates with

zero bytes in the Common Name. Due to a packaging error, the fix for

this issue was not being applied during the build. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. We apologize for the error. ([CVE-2009-2417](/security/CVE-2009-2417))

Original advisory details:

Scott Cantor discovered that curl did not correctly handle SSL

certificates with zero bytes in the Common Name. A remote attacker

could exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view

sensitive information or alter encrypted communications.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libcurl3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.18.0-1ubuntu2.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.18.0-1ubuntu2.3)
* [libcurl3-gnutls](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.18.0-1ubuntu2.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.18.0-1ubuntu2.3)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [libcurl3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2)
* [libcurl3-gnutls](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2)
* [libcurl3-nss](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.21.3-1ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [libcurl3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.21.0-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.21.0-1ubuntu1.1)
* [libcurl3-gnutls](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.21.0-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.21.0-1ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libcurl3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.19.7-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.19.7-1ubuntu1.1)
* [libcurl3-gnutls](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl)
  -
  [7.19.7-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/curl/7.19.7-1ubuntu1.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications

that make use of libcurl to make all the necessary changes.

 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.

curl security update (RHSA-2010-0329)

Original Release Date: May 6, 2010

Last Revised: March 14, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-126

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

cURL is a tool for getting files from FTP, HTTP, Gopher, Telnet, and
DICT
servers, using any of the supported protocols. cURL is designed to work
without user interaction or any kind of interactivity.

It was discovered that when deflate compression was used, libcurl
could call the registered write callback function with data exceeding
the
documented limit. A malicious server could use this flaw to crash an
application using libcurl or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. Note:
This issue only affected applications using libcurl that rely on the
documented data size limit, and that copy the data to the insufficiently
sized buffer.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2010-0734](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0734.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0329.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products on RHEL4 with curl installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services | 4.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2.4 or later |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly
recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the
event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that
customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.3, Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.3

  Impact: A remote attacker may cause an unexpected application termination of cupsd

  Description: A use after free issue exists in cupsd. By issuing a maliciously crafted get-printer-jobs request, an attacker may cause a remote denial of service. This is mitigated through the automatic restart of cupsd after its termination. This issue is addressed through improved connection use tracking. Credit to Tim Waugh for reporting this issue.

* **CUPS**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1748

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.3, Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.3

  Impact: An attacker with access to the CUPS web interface may be able to read a limited amount of memory from the cupsd process

  Description: An uninitialized memory read issue exists in the CUPS web interface's handling of form variables. An attacker with access to the CUPS web interface may be able to read a limited amount of memory from the cupsd process. By default, only local users may access the web interface. Remote users may access it as well when Printer Sharing is enabled. This issue is addressed through improved handling of form variables. Credit to Luca Carettoni for reporting this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-02-09 15:49:30 UTC  ``` A stack based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libcurl used to uncompress zlib compressed data. If an application, using libcurl, was downloading compressed content over HTTP and asked libcurl to automatically uncompress data, it might lead to denial of service (application crash) or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of that application.  Upstream advisory:   [1] <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20100209.html>  Upstream patch:   [2] <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-contentencoding.patch>  Affected versions of cURL/libCURL (from [1]):   7.10.5 to and including 7.19.7  Other references:   [3] <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html#20100209>    [4] <http://curl.haxx.se/download.html>   CVE Request:   [5] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/02/09/5>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Stenberg for responsibly reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Wesley Miaw as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-02-09 16:04:07 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the curl package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.  This issue affects the versions of the curl package, as shipped with Fedora release of 11 and 12.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2010-02-10 16:52:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c0)) > A stack based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libcurl > used to uncompress zlib compressed data.  It does not have to be stack-based.  It depends on the application and what it does with the data in its write callback function.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2010-02-11 15:17:38 UTC  ``` As indicated in the upstream advisory, upstream is not aware of any application using libcurl that is really affected by this flaw.  Searching source of all Red Hat Enterprise Linux applications, only PHP curl extension uses CURLOPT_ENCODING to enable deflate content encoding.  However, PHP's write callback function does not rely on documented "The maximum amount of data that can be passed to the write callback is defined in the curl.h header file: CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE."  Other write callback functions used by RHEL applications either pass data to output file / stream without copying them to intermediate fixed-sized buffer, or use dynamically allocated buffer and don't rely on CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE limit.  So those apps wouldn't be affected even if they used deflate compression.  Third party application using libcurl and relying on the documented CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE limit may be affected by this problem.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c19)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-22 17:34:04 UTC  ``` curl-7.19.7-7.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/curl-7.19.7-7.fc12>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c20)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-22 17:36:08 UTC  ``` curl-7.19.7-5.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/curl-7.19.7-5.fc11>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c21)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-22 17:36:44 UTC  ``` curl-7.19.7-7.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/curl-7.19.7-7.fc12>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c22)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-22 17:44:09 UTC  ``` curl-7.19.7-5.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/curl-7.19.7-5.fc11>   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=563220#c23)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-09 03:29:22 UTC  ``` curl-7.19.7-7.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.

# cURL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in cURL, the worst of
which might allow remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/curl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.24.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.24.0** |

### Background

cURL is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax,
supporting numerous protocols.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in cURL:

* When zlib is enabled, the amount of data sent to an application for
  automatic decompression is not restricted (CVE-2010-0734).
* When performing GSSAPI authentication, credential delegation is
  always used (CVE-2011-2192).
* When SSL is enabled, cURL improperly disables the OpenSSL workaround
  to mitigate an information disclosure vulnerability in the SSL and TLS
  protocols (CVE-2011-3389).
* libcurl does not properly verify file paths for escape control
  characters in IMAP, POP3 or SMTP URLs (CVE-2012-0036).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated process to open a
specially crafted file or URL using cURL, possibly resulting in the
remote execution of arbitrary code, a Denial of Service condition,
disclosure of sensitive information, or unwanted actions performed via
the IMAP, POP3 or SMTP protocols. Furthermore, remote servers may be able
to impersonate clients via GSSAPI requests.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/curl-7.24.0"

```
### References

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
