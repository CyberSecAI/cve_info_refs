{
  "CVE-2010-0734": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in libcurl's handling of gzip-compressed web content. When processing compressed content, libcurl may return an unexpectedly large amount of data to the calling application, potentially leading to an application crash or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from libcurl not properly restricting the amount of data sent to the application's callback function when automatic decompression (deflate) is enabled and used. Specifically, libcurl could call the registered write callback function with data exceeding the documented limit when deflate compression was used.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious server could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using libcurl. This is due to the application copying the data to an insufficiently sized buffer relying on the documented data size limit of libcurl.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious Server",
      "Network Attack"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A malicious server is required to send crafted responses to an application using libcurl, which uses deflate compression and automatic decompression. The attacker must have control over the server to send malicious data that triggers the vulnerability.",
    "Affected Software": [
      "cURL/libCURL versions 7.10.5 to 7.19.7",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5 (shipped curl package)",
      "Fedora release of 11 and 12 (shipped curl package)",
      "Debian (lenny) curl versions < 7.18.2-8lenny4",
      "Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS, 10.10 and 11.04",
        "VMware vCenter Server 4.x and vCenter Update Manager 4.x",
       "VMware ESXi 4.1 and ESX 4.1"
    ],
    "Mitigation": "Upgrade to cURL version 7.20.0 or later, which includes the fix. For systems where updates are not immediately possible, ensure automatic decompression is disabled in libcurl. This issue only affects applications using libcurl that rely on the documented data size limit, and copy the data to an insufficiently sized buffer."
