Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation of the `ExecuteExe` function within the `DVBSExeCall` ActiveX control. This control is installed as part of the DATEV Base System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Remote Command Execution:** The `ExecuteExe` function allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system.
*   **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerable component is an ActiveX control (`DVBSExeCall.ocx`).
*   **Insecure Function:** The `ExecuteExe` function does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing for the injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable software.
*   **System Compromise:** This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
*   **Widespread Vulnerability:** The vulnerable ActiveX control is installed by any DATEV software, making a large number of systems vulnerable if they have DATEV software installed.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser by an attacker crafting a malicious web page that utilizes the vulnerable ActiveX control.
*   **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker can create a web page with malicious JavaScript that calls the vulnerable `ExecuteExe` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have the ability to deliver a malicious web page to a target, typically through network access.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of ActiveX control exploitation and how to craft malicious payloads for command execution.
*   **User Interaction:** The user would need to visit the attacker's malicious website.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory `NSOADV-2010-003` is associated with `CVE-2010-0689`.
*   The affected component is the `DVBSExeCall Control ActiveX Control V.1.0.0.1` (`DVBSExeCall.ocx`).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Nikolas Sotiriu.
*   A patch was released by DATEV to address the issue.
*  The vulnerable ActiveX control has the GUID `{C1CF8B56-3147-41A2-B9BF-79437EED7AFC}`.
*  A proof-of-concept video demonstrating the exploit is available.
