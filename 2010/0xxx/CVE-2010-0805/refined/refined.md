Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer manages long URLs within a specific ActiveX control. An improperly handled long URL leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  The core weakness is memory corruption triggered by the handling of a long URL. Specifically, a stack corruption can occur in `CTDCCtl::SecurityCHeckDataURL`.
- **ActiveX Control Issue:** The vulnerability is within an ActiveX control within Internet Explorer, which is involved in processing tabular data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains full control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted web page designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Office Document:** An attacker could also embed a malicious ActiveX control within a Microsoft Office document, which can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could also use compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content to host malicious content for exploitation.
- **User Interaction:** The user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious document to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior access to the victim's system.
- **Ability to Create Malicious Content:**  The attacker needs to be capable of crafting malicious HTML or Office documents that exploit the ActiveX control weakness with a long URL.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious webpage or open the malicious document.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability specifically affects Internet Explorer 6, and is not present in Internet Explorer 7 or 8.
- Microsoft released security update MS10-018 to address this vulnerability.
- The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned this vulnerability tracking ID ZDI-10-034.
- Trend Micro's TippingPoint IPS provides protection against this vulnerability via filter ID '9634'.
- Workarounds include disabling ActiveX controls in Office and setting the Internet security level to High.
