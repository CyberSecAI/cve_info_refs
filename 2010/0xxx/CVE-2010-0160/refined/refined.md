  "CVE-2010-0160": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox's implementation of Web Workers could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to mishandling array data types when processing posted messages in web worker threads, leading to heap memory corruption. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious web page which, when visited by a target, would trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary code within the context of the user running the browser. User interaction is required, as the target must visit a malicious page to be vulnerable.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Mishandling of array data types during the processing of posted messages within web worker threads.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap memory corruption due to improper handling of array data types.",
        "Lack of proper validation when processing posted messages."

         "Visiting a specially crafted malicious web page.",
