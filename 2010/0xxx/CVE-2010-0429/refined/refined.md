  "cveId": "CVE-2010-0429",
  "description": "The libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses controlled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses controlled by a guest.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of guest-provided data structures leading to controlled memory operations (malloc/free)"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.",
    "attackVector": "A malicious guest OS can control memory addresses used by the host OS for memory management.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "A privileged user within a guest operating system is required to exploit this vulnerability."
