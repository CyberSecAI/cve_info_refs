3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.

 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Advisory Details

April 5th, 2010
## Sun Java Runtime RMIConnectionImpl Privileged Context Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-051ZDI-CAN-588

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-0094](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0094) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Java Runtime](http://java.sun.com/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9591']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Sun Java Runtime Environment. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious website.  The specific flaw exists within the deserialization of RMIConnectionImpl objects. Due to a lack of privilege checks during deserialization it is possible to supply privileged code in the ClassLoader of a constructor being deserialized. This allows for a remote attacker to call system level Java functions without proper sandboxing. Exploitation of this can lead to remote system compromise under the context of the currently logged in user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/javacpumar2010.html> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2009-10-21 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-04-05 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

## Details

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3

protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle attack at the

start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content

at the beginning of the user's session. ([CVE-2009-3555](/security/CVE-2009-3555))

It was discovered that Loader-constraint table, Policy/PolicyFile,

Inflater/Deflater, drag/drop access, and deserialization did not correctly

handle certain sensitive objects. If a user were tricked into running a

specially crafted applet, private information could be leaked to a remote

attacker, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-0082](/security/CVE-2010-0082), [CVE-2010-0084](/security/CVE-2010-0084),

[CVE-2010-0085](/security/CVE-2010-0085), [CVE-2010-0088](/security/CVE-2010-0088), [CVE-2010-0091](/security/CVE-2010-0091), [CVE-2010-0094](/security/CVE-2010-0094))

It was discovered that AtomicReferenceArray, System.arraycopy,

InetAddress, and HashAttributeSet did not correctly handle certain

situations. If a remote attacker could trigger specific error conditions,

a Java application could crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2010-0092](/security/CVE-2010-0092), [CVE-2010-0093](/security/CVE-2010-0093), [CVE-2010-0095](/security/CVE-2010-0095), [CVE-2010-0845](/security/CVE-2010-0845))

It was discovered that Pack200, CMM readMabCurveData, ImagingLib, and

the AWT library did not correctly check buffer lengths. If a user or

automated system were tricked into handling specially crafted JAR files or

images, a remote attacker could crash the Java application or possibly

gain user privileges ([CVE-2010-0837](/security/CVE-2010-0837), [CVE-2010-0838](/security/CVE-2010-0838), [CVE-2010-0847](/security/CVE-2010-0847),

[CVE-2010-0848](/security/CVE-2010-0848)).

It was discovered that applets did not correctly handle certain trust

chains. If a user were tricked into running a specially crafted applet,

a remote attacker could possibly run untrusted code with user privileges.

([CVE-2010-0840](/security/CVE-2010-0840))

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- error handling in subqueries (CVE-2009-4019)
- preserving null\_value flag in GeomFromWKB (CVE-2009-4019)
- symlink behavior fixed (CVE-2008-7247)
- symlink behavior refixed (CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cpio
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that can happen
while expanding specially-crafted archive files (CVE-2010-0624).
It also contains changes for:
- fixed Dat160 Tape Drive density information (bnc#415166)
- fixed cpio issues with file sizes >= 2^32
- fixed handling eof and eod marks (bnc#371077)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- moodle
Moodle version 1.9.8 fixes several security issues including
cross-site-scripting (XSS) and SQL injection bugs (CVE-2010-1613,
CVE-2010-1614, CVE-2010-1615, CVE-2010-1616, CVE-2010-1617
CVE-2010-1618, CVE-2010-1619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- libmikmod
Specially crafted "Impulse Tracker" and "Ultratracker" files could cause a
heap based buffer overflow in libmikmod. Attackers could exploit that to
crash or potentially execute code in applications linking against libmikmod
(CVE-2009-3995, CVE-2009-3996).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libicecore
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs that
can occur while processing malformed XML input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
- CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
- CVE-2009-3560: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. It also includes non-security fixes that are required (because of interdependencies) by those security patches. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative, except as noted below, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2010 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1159443.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=77924097606278&id=1159443.1).

### Unsupported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/).

We recommend that customers upgrade to a supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches. Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=77937127389943&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2010 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1159443.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=77924097606278&id=1159443.1) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- gnome-screensaver
Pressing the "Return" key repeatedly caused an X error that terminated
gnome-screensaver (CVE-2010-0732).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- tomcat5, tomcat6
tomcat was updated to fix several security issues:
- CVE-2009-2693, CVE-2009-2902:
Directory traversal vulnerability allowed remote attackers
to create or overwrite arbitrary files/dirs with a specially crafted
WAR file.
- CVE-2009-2901:
When autoDeploy is enabled the autodeployment process deployed
appBase files that remain from a failed undeploy, which might allow
remote attackers to bypass intended authentication requirements
via HTTP requests.
- CVE-2008-5515:
When using the RequestDispatcher method, it was possible for remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and conduct directory
traversal attacks.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libtheora
An integer overflow was fixed in libtheora. It could be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-3389).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- java-1\_6\_0-sun
Sun Java 6 Update 19 was released to fix a large number of security
issues, including several buffer overflows.
(CVE-2010-0082, CVE-2010-0084, CVE-2010-0085, CVE-2010-0087,
CVE-2010-0088, CVE-2010-0089, CVE-2010-0090, CVE-2010-0091,
CVE-2010-0092, CVE-2010-0093, CVE-2010-0094, CVE-2010-0095,
CVE-2010-0837, CVE-2010-0838, CVE-2010-0839, CVE-2010-0840,
CVE-2010-0841, CVE-2010-0842, CVE-2010-0843, CVE-2010-0844,
CVE-2010-0845, CVE-2010-0846, CVE-2010-0847, CVE-2010-0848,
CVE-2010-0849, CVE-2010-0850).
This update also disables unsafe TLS renegotiations (CVE-2009-3555).
Please refer to the following document for more information:
<http://java.sun.com/javase/javaseforbusiness/docs/TLSReadme.html>
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- samba
With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links on the server
side, therefore allowing clients to overwrite arbitrary files
(CVE-2010-0926). This update changes the default setting to have
"wide links" disabled by default. The new default only works if
"wide links" is not set explicitly in smb.conf.
Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker could corrupt
/etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid root. mount.cifs is not
setuid root by default and it's not recommended to change that
(CVE-2010-0547).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

# Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory - March 2010

## Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory - March 2010

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE and Java for Business also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes.

Please refer to:

* [Java Sun Alerts Archive Page](/security-alerts/javasealertsarchive.html) for information about previous security advisories for Java SE and Java for Business.
* [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 27 new security fixes across all products.

**Note 1:**Java SE releases JDK 5.0 and SDK 1.4.2 have completed the End of Service Life (EOSL) process and are only supported for customers with Solaris 9 and 10. Oracle recommends that users upgrade to the latest Java SE release. Customers interested in continuing to receive critical fixes on JDK 5.0 and SDK 1.4.2 are encouraged to migrate to [Java for Business](//www.sun.com/software/javaforbusiness).

**Note 2:**Java SE releases SDK and JRE 1.3.1 have completed the End of Service Life (EOSL) process and are only supported for customers with Solaris 8 Vintage Support Offering support contracts. Oracle strongly recommends that users upgrade to the latest Java SE or Java for Business release.

**Note 3:** Customers of Oracle products that include a JDK who wish to download the latest 5.0 and 1.4.2 releases should refer to [Java SE (J2SE) End of Life and Oracle Fusion Middleware Policy [ID 952075.1]](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=952075.1) for access to patches.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory.

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

#### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/javasealertsarchive.html) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. Hence Oracle recommends that customers upgrade their Oracle products to a supported version.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations discovered and brought security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle's attention: Dyon Balding of Secunia Research; Steve Dispensa of PhoneFactor; Stephen Fewer of Harmony Security working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Brian Graversen of Signaturgruppen; Sami Koivu of TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Alexandre Pelletier of VUPEN Security; Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor; Regenrecht of iDefense, Regenrecht of TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Sebastien Renaud of VUPEN Security; Marc Schoenefeld of Red Hat; and Peter Vreugendhil of TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
