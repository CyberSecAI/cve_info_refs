How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=619411#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-07-29 13:47:22 UTC  ``` Description of the problem: It is possible that subpage mmio is registered over existing memory page. When this happens "memory" will have real memory address and not index into io_mem array so next access to the page will generate segfault. It is uncommon to have some part of a page to be accessed as memory and some as mmio, but qemu shouldn't crash even when guest does stupid things. So lets just pretend that the rest of the page is unassigned if guest configure part of the memory page as mmio.  Public post: <http://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg39173.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=619411#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:31:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0627 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=619411#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:45:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0622 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0622.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-03-04 16:21:46 UTC  ``` Gleb Napatov found a bug in KVM that can be used to crash the host on Intel machines. If emulator is tricked into emulating mov to/from DR instruction it causes NULL pointer dereference on VMX since kvm_x86_ops->(set|get)_dr are not initialized. Recently this is not exploitable from guest userspace, but malicious guest kernel can trigger it easily.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:31:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0627 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:45:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0622 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0622.html>   ``` |  |

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The openSUSE 11.3 kernel was updated to fix various bugs and security
issues.
Following security issues have been fixed:
CVE-2010-4347: A local user could inject ACPI code into the kernel
via the world-writable "custom\_debug" file, allowing local privilege
escalation.
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address
in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with
other issues.
CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth\_ioctl\_alloc
could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.
CVE-2010-4165: The do\_tcp\_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP\_MAXSEG (aka MSS)
values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a
divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer.
CVE-2010-4164: A remote (or local) attacker communicating over X.25
could cause a kernel panic by attempting to negotiate malformed
facilities.
CVE-2010-4175: A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the
RDS protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is
considered not to be exploitable.
CVE-2010-4169: Use-after-free vulnerability in mm/mprotect.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service via
vectors involving an mprotect system call.
CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module
was fixed. Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not
exploitable.
CVE-2010-4158: A memory information leak in Berkeley packet filter
rules allowed local attackers to read uninitialized memory of the
kernel stack.
CVE-2010-4162: A local denial of service in the blockdevice layer
was fixed.
CVE-2010-4163: By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length,
a local user could have caused a kernel panic.
CVE-2010-0435: The Hypervisor in KVM 83, when the Intel VT-x extension
is enabled, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via vectors related to
instruction emulation.
CVE-2010-3861: The ethtool\_get\_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory,
which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information
via an ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule\_cnt
value.
CVE-2010-3442: Multiple integer overflows in the snd\_ctl\_new function
in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted (1) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD or
(2) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_REPLACE ioctl call.
CVE-2010-3437: A range checking overflow in pktcdvd ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-4078: The sisfb\_ioctl function in drivers/video/sis/sis\_main.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a certain structure
member, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel stack memory via an FBIOGET\_VBLANK ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4080: The snd\_hdsp\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSP\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4081: The snd\_hdspm\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSPM\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4082: The viafb\_ioctl\_get\_viafb\_info function in
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a VIAFB\_GET\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
CVE-2010-3432: The sctp\_packet\_config function in net/sctp/output.c
in the Linux kernel performed extraneous initializations of packet
data structures, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (panic) via a certain sequence of SCTP traffic.
CVE-2010-3067: Integer overflow in the do\_io\_submit function in
fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted use
of the io\_submit system call.
CVE-2010-3865: A iovec integer overflow in RDS sockets was fixed
which could lead to local attackers gaining kernel privileges.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0627)

## Topic

Updated kvm packages that fix three security issues and multiple bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

It was found that QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers
provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver. A privileged guest
user could use this flaw to cause the host to dereference an invalid
pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly,
resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-0431)

A flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the
index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO
initialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the
guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-2784)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found when the host system had a
processor with the Intel VT-x extension enabled. A privileged guest user
could use this flaw to trick the host into emulating a certain instruction,
which could crash the host (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0435)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* running a "qemu-img" check on a faulty virtual machine image ended with a

segmentation fault. With this update, the segmentation fault no longer
occurs when running the "qemu-img" check. (BZ#610342)

* when attempting to transfer a file between two guests that were joined in

the same virtual LAN (VLAN), the receiving guest unexpectedly quit. With
this update, the transfer completes successfully. (BZ#610343)

* installation of a system was occasionally failing in KVM. This was caused

by KVM using wrong permissions for large guest pages. With this update, the
installation completes successfully. (BZ#616796)

* previously, the migration process would fail for a virtual machine

because the virtual machine could not map all the memory. This was caused
by a conflict that was initiated when a virtual machine was initially run
and then migrated right away. With this update, the conflict no longer
occurs and the migration process no longer fails. (BZ#618205)

* using a thinly provisioned VirtIO disk on iSCSI storage and performing a

"qemu-img" check during an "e\_no\_space" event returned cluster errors. With
this update, the errors no longer appear. (BZ#618206)

All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. Note: The procedure in the
Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

The following procedure must be performed before this update will take
effect:

1) Stop all KVM guest virtual machines.

2) Either reboot the hypervisor machine or, as the root user, remove (using
"modprobe -r [module]") and reload (using "modprobe [module]") all of the
following modules which are currently running (determined using "lsmod"):
kvm, ksm, kvm-intel or kvm-amd.

3) Restart the KVM guest virtual machines.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-03-04 16:21:46 UTC  ``` Gleb Napatov found a bug in KVM that can be used to crash the host on Intel machines. If emulator is tricked into emulating mov to/from DR instruction it causes NULL pointer dereference on VMX since kvm_x86_ops->(set|get)_dr are not initialized. Recently this is not exploitable from guest userspace, but malicious guest kernel can trigger it easily.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:31:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0627 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=570528#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-08-19 21:45:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0622 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0622.html>   ``` |  |

RHSA-2010:0622 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2010-08-19
Updated:
2010-08-19
# RHSA-2010:0622 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated rhev-hypervisor packages that fix multiple security issues and two
bugs are now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host did not
validate all pointers provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card
driver. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to cause the host to
dereference an invalid pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of
service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating
their privileges on the host. (CVE-2010-0428)

It was found that the libspice component of QEMU-KVM on the host could be
forced to perform certain memory management operations on memory addresses
controlled by a guest. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash
the guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on
the host. (CVE-2010-0429)

It was found that QEMU-KVM on the host did not validate all pointers
provided from a guest system's QXL graphics card driver. A privileged guest
user could use this flaw to cause the host to dereference an invalid
pointer, causing the guest to crash (denial of service) or, possibly,
resulting in the privileged guest user escalating their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-0431)

A flaw was found in QEMU-KVM, allowing the guest some control over the
index used to access the callback array during sub-page MMIO
initialization. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the
guest (denial of service) or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the
host. (CVE-2010-2784)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found when Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor was run on a system that has a processor with the
Intel VT-x extension enabled. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
to trick the host into emulating a certain instruction, which could crash
the host (denial of service). (CVE-2010-0435)

A flaw was found in the way VDSM accepted SSL connections. An attacker
could trigger this flaw by creating a crafted SSL connection to VDSM,
preventing VDSM from accepting SSL connections from other users.
(CVE-2010-2811)

These updated packages provide updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for avahi issues
CVE-2009-0758 and CVE-2010-2244; freetype issues CVE-2010-1797,
CVE-2010-2498, CVE-2010-2499, CVE-2010-2500, CVE-2010-2519, CVE-2010-2527,
and CVE-2010-2541; kernel issues CVE-2010-1084, CVE-2010-2066,
CVE-2010-2070, CVE-2010-2226, CVE-2010-2248, CVE-2010-2521, and
CVE-2010-2524; and openldap issues CVE-2010-0211 and CVE-2010-0212.

These updated rhev-hypervisor packages also fix two bugs. Documentation for
these bug fixes will be available shortly from
<http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_for_Servers/2.2/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
fixes from the KVM update RHSA-2010:0627 have been included in this update.
Also included are the bug fixes from the VDSM update RHSA-2010:0628.

KVM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0627.html> VDSM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0628.html>

Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to these updated rhev-hypervisor packages, which resolve these
issues.
