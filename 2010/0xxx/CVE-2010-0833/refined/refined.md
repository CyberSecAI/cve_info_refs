Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-0833:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper check on password expiration for local-provider accounts in Likewise Open. Specifically, the system failed to enforce password expiration policies for these accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Password Expiration Checks:** The primary vulnerability lies in the lack of proper enforcement of password expiration, allowing the use of expired passwords.
*   **Local Account Management Issues:** The vulnerability specifically affects local provider accounts managed by Likewise Open's `lsassd` service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Access Restriction Bypass:** An attacker could bypass local login restrictions, gaining unauthorized access to a system by using an expired password for a local-provider account.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly mentioned, gaining access to a system using an expired password could lead to privilege escalation if the exploited account has elevated privileges or if other vulnerabilities are present in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker, meaning someone with shell access or the ability to log into the target system.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The attacker leverages the flaw in password expiration handling to bypass normal authentication mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the target system, meaning they are not exploiting a vulnerability across a network.
*   **Knowledge of Local Accounts:** The attacker needs to know the username of the local-provider account with the expired password.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability impacts "HP StorageWorks X9000 Network Storage Systems, all 5.4 versions" and "likewise-open" package.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) according to the provided HP Security Bulletin.
*   **Mitigation:** The recommended mitigation is to explicitly disable local Administrator accounts and any unused `lsassd` local-provider accounts.
*   **Fix:** The fix includes disabling the Administrator account on first provisioning, explicitly marking lsassd local provider accounts as disabled if they exist in their initial provisioned state, forcing pam password changes to require the existing password for authentication, and enforcing the "user cannot change password" field.
*   **Ubuntu Specific Fix:** For Ubuntu 10.04, the patched version of `likewise-open5-lsass` is `5.4.0.42111-2ubuntu1.1`.
