  - Redirecting the user to phishing sites
  - Defacing the web page
  - Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the search field within the Portlet Palette.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the search field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the Portlet Palette and utilize the search functionality.
- The attacker needs the ability to input data in the vulnerable search field of the Portlet Palette.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified by IBM as APAR PM05829.
- A fix is available for this vulnerability in WebSphere Portal V6.0.
