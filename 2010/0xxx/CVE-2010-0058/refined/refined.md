Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2010-0058:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A configuration issue introduced in Security Update 2009-005 prevented `freshclam` from running.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `freshclam` daemon, responsible for updating virus definitions for ClamAV, was not running due to an incorrect configuration. Specifically, the launchd plist ProgramArguments key values were misconfigured.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact of this vulnerability was that ClamAV virus definitions might not be updated, leaving systems vulnerable to new malware.

**Attack vectors:**
This was not directly exploitable by an attacker. It was a misconfiguration introduced by a previous update that prevented the ClamAV virus definitions from updating.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
No specific attacker capabilities or position were required since it was a configuration issue rather than an exploitable vulnerability.

This vulnerability affected:
- Mac OS X v10.5.8
- Mac OS X Server v10.5.8

This issue was resolved by updating `freshclam`'s launchd plist ProgramArguments key values in Security Update 2010-002
