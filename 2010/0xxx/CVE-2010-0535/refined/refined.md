- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An access control issue exists in Dovecot when Kerberos authentication is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the insufficient access control checks within Dovecot when handling Kerberos authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can send and receive mail even if they are not included in the Service Access Control List (SACL) that defines users permitted to do so.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who is an authenticated user of the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system with Dovecot and Kerberos enabled.
