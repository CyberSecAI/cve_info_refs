```
Root cause of vulnerability:
  - When processing certain responses containing out-of-bailiwick data, BIND is subject to a DNS cache poisoning vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - DNS cache poisoning due to improper handling of out-of-bailiwick data in DNS responses.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to poison the DNS cache, potentially redirecting traffic to malicious servers.

Attack vectors:
  - Sending crafted DNS responses with out-of-bailiwick data to a vulnerable BIND server.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send DNS responses to the target BIND server. This would typically involve being able to intercept or spoof responses from an authoritative name server.
  - DNSSEC validation must be enabled and trust anchors installed on the BIND server for the vulnerability to be exploitable. This is not a default setting.
