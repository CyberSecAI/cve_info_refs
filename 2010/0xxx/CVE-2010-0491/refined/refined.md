{
  "CVE-2010-0491": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer accessing an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is a memory corruption vulnerability. Specifically, it is a use-after-free issue that occurs when accessing an object that has been freed or not properly initialized.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution with the privileges of the logged-on user. This could lead to complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights, enabling the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTML document/web page viewed in Internet Explorer. Attackers can also embed the exploit in Microsoft Office documents or applications that use the Internet Explorer rendering engine.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must convince a user to view a specially crafted web page or open a malicious document. No special network position is required for the attacker as it's a client-side attack."
