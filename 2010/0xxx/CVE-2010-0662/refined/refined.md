*  **Issue 9877:** A medium severity cross-domain theft due to a CSS design error.
*  **Issue 30660:** A high severity cross-domain access error.

These cross-domain issues in the browser could be related to CVE-2010-0662 as it's a common area for web browser vulnerabilities. It's also possible that the description of CVE-2010-0662 was not publicly available and the linked bugs have been kept private until a majority of users have updated their browser.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The identified issues related to cross-domain vulnerabilities are linked to CSS design errors and general cross-domain access problems within the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Domain Theft (Issue 9877):** A flaw in the browser's handling of CSS allows for unauthorized access to data across different domains.
*   **Cross-Domain Access Error (Issue 30660):** A broader vulnerability that permits unauthorized access to resources or functionalities across different security domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:** Exploitation of the CSS design flaw could lead to sensitive data being stolen from a user's browser session, potentially exposing personal or private information.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Exploitation of the cross-domain access error could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user or gain access to protected functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Websites:** Attackers can embed malicious code within a web page that exploits the vulnerabilities. When a user visits this malicious site, the exploit can trigger the browser's cross-domain weakness.
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Although not directly mentioned, the vulnerabilities may be exploitable via cross-site scripting attacks, where malicious code is injected into a trusted website to perform unauthorized actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Hosting:** An attacker needs to host malicious content on a web server or compromise a web server to deliver the exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the victim to visit a malicious or compromised web page for the exploit to work.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The specific technical details about the CSS design error and cross-domain access error are not disclosed in the release notes.
*   The fixes were included in Chrome version 4.0.249.78, suggesting that older versions are vulnerable.
