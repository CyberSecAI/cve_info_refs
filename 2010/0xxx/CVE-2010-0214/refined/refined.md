Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The PolyVision RoomWizard web-based scheduling system has two main vulnerabilities:

1.  **Insecure Storage of Sync Connector Credentials:** The RoomWizard stores Active Directory (AD) credentials for its Sync Connector feature in the HTML source code of a web page accessible through the administrative interface. These credentials, which include the username and password, are exposed in the content of a web page at `http://DeviceIP:80/admin/sign/DeviceSynch`. Although the password field is masked as a password type input, the value is still present in the HTML source.
2.  **Default Administrative Password:** The RoomWizard ships with a default password ("roomwizard") for its administrator account, which allows unauthenticated users to access the device console via HTTP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:**  AD credentials used by the Sync Connector are stored and displayed in the HTML source of a web page, allowing them to be easily viewed by anyone with HTTP access to the device.
*   **Use of Default Password:** The device is deployed with a default administrative password, "roomwizard", which is widely known and easily exploited. This allows for unauthorized access to the administrative interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can gain access to the Sync Connector's Active Directory credentials, potentially allowing access to other resources on the network.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain full access to the RoomWizard device's web interface with the default password.
*  **Device Control:** With administrative access, an attacker could modify settings, including network configuration, thus disrupting legitimate users access to the RoomWizard device.
*   **Data Disclosure:** The exposed credentials can be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs HTTP access to the RoomWizard device.
*   **Direct Request:** Accessing `http://DeviceIP:80/admin/sign/DeviceSynch` exposes Sync Connector credentials.
*   **Default Password Exploitation:** Accessing the device console using the default "roomwizard" password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network or have network access to the RoomWizard device.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:**  Ability to make HTTP requests and view page source.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** Knowledge of the default "roomwizard" password is required for administrative console access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was tested on RoomWizard firmware version 3.2.3 (Model RW10).
*   The vendor was informed of the issue, and the vulnerability was reportedly fixed in later versions of the firmware.
*   The CERT/CC vulnerability note number is VU#870601.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Sean Lam.
