- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `mod.php` script in phpCOIN 1.2.1 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient sanitization of the `mod` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, potentially revealing configuration files, source code, or other critical information.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `mod` parameter in the `mod.php` script's URL, an attacker can specify a path to a local file on the server. The exploit leverages path traversal and null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass potential file extension checks or other input validation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `mod.php` script. No specific user role or authentication is mentioned as needed to exploit the vulnerability.
