  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in various Oracle products and components.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote execution of arbitrary code",
    "Information disclosure",
    "Denial of service"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Compromising an Oracle database may allow access to sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote access, potentially unauthenticated, is required for exploitation. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information."
