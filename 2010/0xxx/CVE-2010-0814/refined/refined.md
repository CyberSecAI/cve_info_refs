Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-0814:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles memory allocation when loading multiple Access ActiveX controls. Specifically, a remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Access ActiveX controls due to the way that multiple ActiveX controls are loaded by Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper memory handling when instantiating a series of Access ActiveX controls within Internet Explorer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.
- Systems may crash due to the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker hosts a malicious website containing a sequence of Access ActiveX controls designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also host malicious content to exploit this vulnerability.
- The user must be convinced to visit the malicious site, typically by clicking a link in an email or instant message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website or inject malicious code into a website to lure a victim to the page.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted web page containing the vulnerable sequence of ActiveX controls.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the targeted system.
