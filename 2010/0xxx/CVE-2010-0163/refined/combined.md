- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel
This update adds support for RFC5746 TLS renegotiations to address
vulnerabilities tracked as (CVE-2009-3555).
It also fixes a mishandling of OOM conditions in bn\_wexpand
(CVE-2009-3245).
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin
- libpng12-0

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

MailNews Core :: MIME
Problems with parsing the MIME structure and displaying messages. When this problem happens, it's often useful to attach a copy of the mail message generating the problem. If you have Communicator 4.x, you can select the message and save it as an .eml file (just save with the .eml extension). A few examples: 1. The contents of a message do not display properly. Certain items do not show up.

Unless I'm missing something, this code already has null checks, so I don't see any obvious way of fixing this. So a test case would be really helpful.

Are we in contact with the user? We need to somehow figure out which message is causing the crash and get a copy of it. How we proceed depends somewhat on how technical the user is. If the user can run a debug build under the debugger, we'd just want to poke at some variables in the debugger to identify the message. If not, then we'd need to turn on some sort of logging to figure out which message is crashing. It would also be helpful to know if it's an imap or local message.

Ok no problem, I can do it. However, the crash is related to archive mail in the local folders. If I leave this folders Thunderbird runnig fine.

Massimiliano, if you want to narrow down which message is causing the problem by a binary search, halving the folder each time, and then give me the message, that would be OK too.
How do you mean, "leave this folder"? You can't turn off indexing of a local folder - do you mean you move the folder out of your profile?
Thx for helping with this!

Unless you're fluent in using a debugger, and able to poke around in the local variables when you crash (apologies for not knowing if you are), it would probably be easier to just find the crashing message. I see from the other bug that the folder is > 10000 messages, which would make it painful. One possibility is make a new folder with just the messages that have attachments, by sorting by the attachment column, and copying them to a new folder, under the supposition that the crashing message has an attachment (just a guess from the stack trace).

Or, In the Config Editor (Advanced
prefs) turn on: mailnews.database.global.logging.console and
mailnews.database.global.logging.dump
(.dump will go to stderr, so that works if you know how to run thunderbird from
a shell/console)
and then wait for the crash - I'm not sure if gloda gives enough info with logging to give you an idea of which message it crashed on, but it might.

The gloda logging might be the easiest way - I think it will tell you the message key of the messages its streaming; after you crash, you should be able to turn on the order received column for your local folder to find what the message with that key is...

If needed, there is a FF extension JSConsoleOutput that will redirect js console to disk. It's no longer available from the author's website. I think I have a version hacked up for TB. FF version available at <http://mac.softpedia.com/progDownload/JS-Console-output-redirector-Download-36363.html>

No problem, sorry you were ill - you don't need a debug build to do gloda logging. You should be able to find the message by following these 10 simple steps :-)
1. Use the config editor to set mailnews.database.global.logging.console to true.
2. Install the extension that Wayne mentioned (he'll have to get that to you somehow).
3 Move the mail folder that causes the crash back into your profile
4. Startup and run until you crash.
5 Save off the file that contains js console output the extension generated, which should have information about the crash, specifically the message key of the last message it tried to index, at the end of the log.
6 Move the bad mail folder away, restart
7 Turn off gloda indexing, shutdown.
8 Move the crashing folder back into your profile, restart,
9 Click on the bad folder, add the "order received" column to the message list.
10. Sort by order received, and find the message with the key that the log tells you gloda last tried to index.

I'm pretty sure there's a way to get more logging out of gloda, besides just warnings and errors

OK, I've generated a try server build that uses nspr logging to log the mailbox urls we run - it should show up here in an hour or two - <http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=ThunderbirdTry>
To generate a log, you need to follow these instructions:
[https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews:Logging](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MailNews%3ALogging)
The log module is "mailbox" (not imap or pop3 or any of those). You should add the "sync" option just in case we crash before the data is written to the log, so
NSPR\_LOG\_MODULES=mailbox:5,sync

If you hide the message pane (f8), it might make it easier to select a message and copy it to a new folder (might want to turn gloda off temporarily as well)

marking as security sensitive - 2.0 has this problem as well, though it's unlikely this is exploitable. It's a bad cast that causes reads of invalid memory addresses. I do have a very simple fix. I need to see if the test case can be simplified. It looks to be simply a multipart mixed message with text/html part and an message/rfc822 part.

Attached patch

[fix crash](attachment.cgi?id=406026&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=505221&attachment=406026)

This fixes the crash. I have a reduced test case (basically taking the text and e-mail addresses out of the original test case). I'd like to add this to the xpcshell-tests, but there are still a few assertions triggered by the test case, and that breaks xpcshell tests in debug builds. The assertions look relatively harmless, in the sense that they're handled, and I've seen them before with other messages.

fix crash
Yes, the code seems much more correct now.
There isn't actually an SR target requested...
If one of the assertions/warnings is about the lack of an identity, I have that resolved in my gloda patch, with the relevant code being as follows if you want to backport it and stick it somewhere:
acctMgr.createLocalMailAccount();
let localAccount = acctMgr.FindAccountForServer(acctMgr.localFoldersServer);
// We need an identity or we get angry warnings.
let identity = acctMgr.createIdentity();
localAccount.addIdentity(identity);
localAccount.defaultIdentity = identity;

no, the assertions are in libmime, about sending empty lines to the parser, and attempting to close already closed objects...I strongly suspect this code is involved:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mailnews/mime/src/mimemsg.cpp#238>
where we're hacking on a newline onto the end of the message part, if we didn't find one.

this is an sanitized test case.
It turns out if I add a blank line before the ending mime part separator, this problem goes away. It turns out the code I mxr'ed above is the cause of this problem. If I fix that issue, the assertions go away as well, so I can add a test case - yay!

Could we use the testcase in a xpshell test so we don't regress in the future ?Flags: in-testsuite?

Attached patch

[cumulative fix with xpcshell test](attachment.cgi?id=406070&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=406070&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=505221&attachment=406070)

The underlying issue was that the patch in [bug 413874](/show_bug.cgi?id=413874 "RESOLVED FIXED - Audit mail MIME code for string buffer abuse") didn't pass in the right output buffer size into PL\_strncpyz, so we were only appending <CR>, not <CRLF>, which, on windows, was getting libmime rather confused about how the part ended...not sure what would happen on linux/mac - we wouldn't have any line endings, which would probably generate an assertion or twenty.
I still think the change to CountTotalMimeAttachments is worthwhile.
I added a mime streaming test to libmime. libmime could certainly use some more test cases, though the gloda tests exercise most of the basics.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-915-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

18 March 2010

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-0689](/security/CVE-2009-0689), [CVE-2009-2463](/security/CVE-2009-2463), [CVE-2009-3075](/security/CVE-2009-3075))

Josh Soref discovered that the BinHex decoder used in Thunderbird contained

a flaw. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, a remote

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3072](/security/CVE-2009-3072))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly manage memory when

using XUL tree elements. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-3077](/security/CVE-2009-3077))

Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm discovered that Thunderbird did not properly

display filenames containing right-to-left (RTL) override characters. If a

user were tricked into opening a malicious file with a crafted filename, an

attacker could exploit this to trick the user into opening a different file

than the user expected. ([CVE-2009-3376](/security/CVE-2009-3376))

Takehiro Takahashi discovered flaws in the NTLM implementation in

Thunderbird. If an NTLM authenticated user opened content containing links

to a malicious website, a remote attacker could send requests to other

applications, authenticated as the user. ([CVE-2009-3983](/security/CVE-2009-3983))

Ludovic Hirlimann discovered a flaw in the way Thunderbird indexed certain

messages with attachments. A remote attacker could send specially crafted

content and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0163](/security/CVE-2010-0163))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
