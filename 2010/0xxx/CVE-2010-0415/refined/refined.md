{
  "CVE-2010-0415": {
    "Description": "The do_pages_move function in mm/migrate.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33-rc7 does not validate node values, which allows local users to read arbitrary kernel memory locations, cause a denial of service (OOPS), and possibly have unspecified other impact by specifying a node that is not part of the kernels node set.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `do_pages_move` function does not validate node values passed from userspace, which allows for out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds memory access"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can read arbitrary kernel memory, cause a denial of service (OOPS), and potentially have other unspecified impact by providing invalid node values.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local user exploits the vulnerable `sys_move_pages` system call by providing a crafted 'node' value that is not part of the kernel's node set.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "A local user with the ability to execute code on the target system."
