Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-0181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Firefox and other Mozilla-based products handle redirects when loading resources specified in `<img>` tags. Specifically, if an image resource redirects to a `mailto:` URL, the browser will launch the system's external email handler instead of displaying an image or handling it as a regular resource.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unexpected Behavior:** The primary weakness is that loading an image should not trigger the opening of an external email client. This unexpected behavior can be abused.
- **Lack of Content Policy Enforcement:** The browser did not properly enforce content policies on redirected URLs, allowing the `mailto:` URL to be processed and trigger the email client.
- **Bypass of Security Mechanisms:** This vulnerability can be exploited to bypass popup blockers, as the email client is launched without explicit user interaction like a link click.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Annoyance/Denial of Service:** While not a critical security risk like code execution, the primary impact is user annoyance due to the unexpected opening of an email client. By repeatedly loading images that redirect to `mailto:` URLs, a form of denial of service (DoS) can be achieved by overwhelming a user with repeated email program launches.
- **Spam/Phishing Vector**: The vulnerability can be leveraged to bypass popup blockers, potentially leading to spam/phishing scenarios

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker can embed an `<img>` tag in a web page that points to a resource they control. This resource then redirects to a `mailto:` URL. When a user visits the page, their email client is launched.
- **Forum/Blog Spam:** Attackers could insert malicious code into forum posts, comments, or blog entries by leveraging the `<img>` tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Content:** The attacker needs the ability to host a resource that can redirect to a `mailto:` URL, and this can be on their own web server.
- **Knowledge of HTML:** The attacker must be able to insert/embed `<img>` tags within a web page, or within a location that allows for html.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers may use social engineering to lure a user to a website, post, or comment containing the malicious code.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by phpBB developer Henry Sudhof.
- It was initially fixed in Firefox 3.5.9, Firefox 3.6.2, and SeaMonkey 2.0.4, but not in Firefox 3.0.
- The fix implemented in later versions of Firefox prevents image redirects to `mailto:` URLs from triggering email clients. Instead, a broken image is shown.
- The issue also existed in other browsers like Opera 9.52, IE6/8 and Chrome, but was patched in later versions.
- Patches involved checking for the URI\_DOES\_NOT\_RETURN\_DATA or URI\_NON\_PERSISTABLE protocol handler flags, and preventing image loads if the target URL matched these attributes.

The vulnerability is considered low impact, mainly causing annoyance/minor DOS rather than critical security compromises like remote code execution.
