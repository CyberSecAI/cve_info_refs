    *   `kiddog_mysqldumper` (kiddog\_mysqldumper) versions 0.0.3 and below

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities are programming errors in the mentioned extensions, allowing for SQL injection, XSS, information disclosure, and path traversal. Specifically, the SQL injection vulnerabilities arise from improper sanitization of user inputs when constructing SQL queries, while the XSS vulnerabilities come from insufficient sanitization when rendering output to the browser.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Could allow an attacker to read, modify or delete data within the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the affected website.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to user session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Information Disclosure / Path Traversal:** Could allow an attacker to access sensitive data or files on the server, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
Attack vectors for these vulnerabilities vary but generally involve:
*   Manipulating input fields or URL parameters to inject SQL commands.
*   Inserting malicious scripts into input fields or user-controlled data that is then displayed on the website.
*   Accessing files or directories through manipulating file paths used by the application.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the affected web application, either through public interfaces or through compromised user accounts.
*   Specific knowledge of the vulnerable extensions and their parameters might be needed to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that several extensions were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to unpatched vulnerabilities and inability to contact the authors. Users of these extensions are advised to uninstall them.
*   The advisory recommends following the TYPO3 Security Cookbook and subscribing to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security bulletins.
