Hi,

Lots of our users also tested if the KDE screenlock program is affected
by the "unlock by pressing return" bug.

And it is.

There is also a race condition and/or a memory leak which causes
the lock program to terminate.

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=579280>
<http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217882>
<http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226449>

Suspend to * is not required, it also works just by pressing return.
For me it takes like 5 seconds. Machine load might help.

It is unclear which KDE versions are affected, reports mostly show
KDE 4.4.0.

Needs a different CVE than the GNOME one.

Ciao, Marcus

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=226449#c0)  Steve Gilberd    2010-02-12 04:19:34 UTC  ``` Version:            (using KDE 4.4.0) Compiler:          gcc (Gentoo 4.4.3 p1.0) 4.4.3, x86_64 Compiler was compiled by gcc-4.4.3, with -O2 -march=native for Intel C2D E8400. KDE was also compiled as -O2 -march=native, for the same CPU. OS:                Linux Installed from:    Compiled From Sources  Problem: Repeatedly pressing the 'return' key at the lock screen will either unlock the system and allow full access (security problem), or will cause kscreenlocker to hang with a blank dialog box containing no content and no buttons.  Pressing approx twice per second unlocks the screen. Pressing very quickly (many times per second) results in a hang.  Expected behavior: Pressing return should present an 'unlocking failed' message; pressing return repeatedly should continue to display the message until the user stops harassing it.  Steps to reproduce the unlock: 1. Lock the screen 2. Slowly press the 'return' key a couple of times per second - the screen will unlock after 5-8 presses.  Steps to reproduce the hang: 1.

I took a quick look at the code. If you hold down the Enter key at the prompt, you'll see the "hang" described, but if you then check the list of processes you'll see many kcheckpass processes. It seems possible that there is a race condition between when the socket notifier sNot is created and deleted. The many Enter key presses cause the gplugStart function to be run many times, forking off new kcheckpass processes and changing the value of sNot such that only the last process created is communicated with. Then the rest are left in a parentless state, creating the "hang". If I'm right about this, something similar could be going on that causes the crash, depending on the timing of the sNot deletion and re-initialization. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=226449#c4)  Oswald Buddenhagen    2010-02-12 09:24:19 UTC  ``` now, that makes some sense :)  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 217882](show_bug.cgi?id=217882 "RESOLVED FIXED - Desktop locking crashs after resume from suspend to RAM [QSocketNotifier::setEnabled, PasswordDlg::reapVerify, PasswordDlg::handleVerify]") *** ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=226449#c5)  Michael Düll    2010-02-12 17:16:15 UTC  ``` This is not a duplicate of [bug 217882](show_bug.cgi?id=217882 "RESOLVED FIXED - Desktop locking crashs after resume from suspend to RAM [QSocketNotifier::setEnabled, PasswordDlg::reapVerify, PasswordDlg::handleVerify]").

Gentoo and Fedora distribution maintainers have also tested this patch
and verified that it works. The patch against 4.4.0 can easily be
obtained from here: <http://websvn.kde.org/?view=revision&revision=1089241>

As this is now backported to the 4.4 branch, it is expected that 4.4.0
will be the only release affected by this vulnerability.

Thanks,
Jeff

KDE Security Advisory: KRunner lock module race condition
Original Release Date: 2010-02-17
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-2010-02-17-1.txt
0. References
oCert: N/A
CVE: N/A
1. Systems affected:
KDE 4.4.0 is the only version affected.
2. Overview:
KRunner lock module race condition:
The KRunner lock module forks a process to perform password
validation. This forking process does not properly check whether an
existing process has already been forked, creating a race condition if
the Enter key is pressed after a process has been forked but before
the password has been validated. In this case, multiple processes can
be forked, causing a socket listener on the parent to point to either
an incorrect process that has not received the password data,
resulting in a hang, or in some cases cause the socket notifier to
point to an already-deleted object, resulting in a crash that brings
the user to the desktop and circumvents the lock mechanism.
Note: the locking is actually performed by KRunner, which is part of
the kdebase module, and not KScreenSaver; even when no screen saver
is being used an affected system can still be compromised.
3. Impact:
This is a critical vulnerability that is easily exploited if physical
access to a machine is granted, and can result in an attacker gaining
full privileges of the user whose screen is currently locked.
4. Solution:
Source code patches have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. OS vendors / binary package providers have been
contacted and in most cases a patched version should already be
available. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider for
information about how to obtain updated binary packages or for
information about which version of the package contains the patch.
5. Patch:
Patches for KDE 4.4.0 have been committed to Subversion, and are
available from websvn.kde.org:
http://websvn.kde.org/?view=rev&revision=1089241
A patch may also be obtained directly from the Subversion repository
(no checkout needed) with the following command:
svn diff -r 1089240:1089241 \
svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/KDE/4.4/kdebase/workspace/krunner/lock

Since I forget if you can set a pointer to zero after calling deleteLater on it, add a bool value like sNotExists, guarded within the mutex -- or simply delete sNot directly at that point instead of using deleteLater, which would guarantee that the bool value is correct, in case something interrupts the event loop.

I'm going to try to reproduce this against 4.3 to verify the cause, then fix it. In the meantime, ossi, can you explain the reasoning for making it asynch? ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=217882#c15)  Jeff Mitchell    2010-02-12 17:53:56 UTC  ``` I didn't realize it was single threaded.

Sorry it's not in the same thread, as I wasn't subscribed to this list
at the time.

I can verify that only KDE SC 4.4.0 is affected. Released versions of
4.3 are *not* affected by this bug.

I have committed a patch to the KDE SVN server as revision 1089213. See
<https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D217882#c16>

Although this solved the problem for me locally, I'm in the process of
having other testers verify that they can no longer reproduce the
problem with this patch, and will report back once this is verified.

Thanks,
Jeff

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
