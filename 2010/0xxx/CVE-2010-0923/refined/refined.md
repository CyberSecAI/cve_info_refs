{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The KRunner lock module forks a process for password validation, but doesn't check if a process has already been forked, leading to a race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition: Multiple processes can be forked if the Enter key is repeatedly pressed before validation completes."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access can bypass the screen lock, gaining full user privileges. It can also cause a crash of the lock dialog, leading to the user being returned to the desktop without requiring authentication.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Repeatedly pressing the Enter key (or possibly other keys) on the lock screen."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to a locked machine is required.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in the KRunner lock module (part of kdebase) and is not specific to KScreenSaver, making systems vulnerable even without a screensaver. The issue involves a socket listener on the parent process pointing to an incorrect process or a deleted object due to multiple password validation processes being forked. This can result in a hang, a crash, or the lock being bypassed."
