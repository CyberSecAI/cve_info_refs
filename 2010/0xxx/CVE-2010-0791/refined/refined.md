Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `ncpmount`, `ncpumount`, and `ncplogin` utilities create lockfiles insecurely.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure lockfile creation. The utilities create lockfiles in an insecure manner, specifically at `/etc/mtab~`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A local attacker can create a stale lockfile at `/etc/mtab~`.
- This stale lockfile can cause other mount utilities to fail.
- This leads to denial-of-service conditions, where users are unable to mount or unmount filesystems.

**Attack vectors:**

- Local access is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker must be able to execute the vulnerable utilities (`ncpmount`, `ncpumount`, or `ncplogin`).

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is part of a set of issues found in the `ncpfs` package (along with CVE-2010-0788 and CVE-2010-0790).
- The fix involves patching the `ncpfs` utilities.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple SUSE products.
