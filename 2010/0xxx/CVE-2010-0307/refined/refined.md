  "CVE-2010-0307": {
    "description": "The load_elf_binary function in fs/binfmt_elf.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32.8 on the x86_64 platform does not ensure that the ELF interpreter is available before a call to the SET_PERSONALITY macro, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application and then triggers a segmentation fault, as demonstrated by amd64_killer, related to the flush_old_exec function.",
    "root_cause": "The `load_elf_binary` function in `fs/binfmt_elf.c` calls `SET_PERSONALITY()` before verifying that the ELF interpreter is available. This can lead to a mismatch in the process's personality (32-bit vs. 64-bit) if the interpreter is not found.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of the ELF interpreter before setting process personality."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service (system crash) by exploiting this vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local user executes a 32-bit application that attempts to execute a 64-bit application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access is needed to execute the malicious 32-bit application."
  }
