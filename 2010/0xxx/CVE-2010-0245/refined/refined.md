Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-0245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer accesses objects that have either not been correctly initialized or have already been deleted. This improper access leads to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uninitialized Memory Corruption: The core issue is that the browser attempts to use memory that hasn't been properly set up or has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- Full System Control: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the system.
- Malicious Actions: An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based Attacks: An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability.
- Compromised Websites:  Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that host user-generated content or ads.
- Phishing: Attackers can use social engineering techniques (like links in emails) to trick users into visiting the malicious site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a specially crafted webpage, or the ability to inject the malicious code into a website.
- Requires the user to interact with the attacker's content, such as by clicking a link or visiting a compromised website, or opening a malicious file,

**Additional Details:**
- This specific vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 8.
- Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is mentioned as a mitigation that makes exploitation more difficult.  However, there are reports that DEP can be bypassed, especially on Windows XP.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed at the time of the bulletin's release but Microsoft received the information via responsible disclosure
- There were no reports of the vulnerability being actively exploited at the time this bulletin was released.
