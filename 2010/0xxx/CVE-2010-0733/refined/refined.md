CVE-2010-0733:
Root cause of vulnerability: An integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of the hash table used for joined relations. Specifically, the number of batches (nbatch) can be set to INT_MAX/2, and when this is multiplied by the size of a pointer, it overflows to zero, resulting in a small (or empty) allocation for the hash table's outer batch file array.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflow leading to insufficient memory allocation, which can cause a crash.

Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (PostgreSQL daemon crash).

Attack vectors: An attacker can craft a specific SQL query with many LEFT JOIN operations that trigger the integer overflow during hash table size calculation.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to send a crafted SQL query to the PostgreSQL server. This could be achieved through a client application, a compromised application, or direct database access.
