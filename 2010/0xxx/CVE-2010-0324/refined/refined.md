    *   TV21 Talkshow (tv21\_talkshow) - Also has XSS
    *   Vote rank for news (vote\_for\_tt\_news) - Also has XSS

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Developer log (devlog)
    *   KJ: Imagelightbox (kj\_imagelightbox2)
    *   Unit Converter (cs2\_unitconv)
    *   TV21 Talkshow (tv21\_talkshow) - Also has SQLi
     *   Vote rank for news (vote\_for\_tt\_news) - Also has SQLi
    *   Majordomo (majordomo)
    *   Tip many friends (mimi\_tipfriends)
    *   VD / Geomap (vd\_geomap)

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Photo Book (goof\_fotoboek) - Path traversal
    *   SB Folderdownload (sb\_folderdownload)
    *    kiddog\_mysqldumper (kiddog\_mysqldumper)

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user inputs or lack of proper parameterization when constructing SQL queries, leading to malicious SQL code execution.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data when rendering in the browser, allowing malicious scripts to execute.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Insecure handling of file paths or data, allowing unauthorized access or revealing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to read, modify, or delete data from the database. Could also lead to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can steal user cookies, session tokens, perform actions on behalf of the user, and redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting user input fields or parameters by injecting malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts via user-controlled input fields or parameters, or via stored content within the system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in file path handling or insecure data storage/access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection & XSS:** Attackers would need to identify and exploit vulnerable parameters or input fields in the affected extensions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers would need to exploit file access or data handling vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory emphasizes that these are third-party extensions and not part of the TYPO3 core.
*   Some vulnerable extensions were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the lack of author response or a timely patch, requiring users to manually uninstall and remove them.
*   The advisory recommends following the TYPO3 Security Cookbook and subscribing to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security bulletins.
