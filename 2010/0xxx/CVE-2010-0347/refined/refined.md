    *   SB Folderdownload (sb\_folderdownload)
    *    kiddog\_mysqldumper (kiddog\_mysqldumper)

**Root Cause:**

The root causes vary based on the vulnerability type and specific extension:

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input used in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Failure to properly sanitize user input before displaying it on a web page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users.
*  **Information Disclosure/Path Traversal:**  Improper access control, allowing attackers to access files or resources they are not authorized to view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Could lead to unauthorized access to or modification of the database, potential data breaches, and manipulation of application logic.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement of websites, and redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Information Disclosure/Path Traversal:**  Could allow attackers to access sensitive data or files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Malicious input through web forms or other user-controlled entry points.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts through user inputs that are not properly sanitized before being displayed.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exploiting vulnerabilities related to file paths or access controls within the extensions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers would need the ability to submit crafted input to the vulnerable extensions, typically through a web browser.

**Additional Information**

The security advisory indicates that several extensions with high-severity vulnerabilities were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to the maintainers not responding or providing fixes. Users were advised to uninstall these extensions, and are advised not to use these extensions.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, which usually does not list every vulnerable extension individually, but instead would focus on the general vulnerabilities present in TYPO3.
