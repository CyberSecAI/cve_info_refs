- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A filesystem permission issue exists in QuickTime.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect filesystem permissions
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user may gain access to the "Apple Computer" directory within their profile, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on a system with QuickTime installed.
