Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-0798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The TYPO3 extension `t3blog` fails to properly sanitize user-supplied parameters from HTML forms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  Due to the lack of input sanitization, it is possible to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of the database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The failure to sanitize input allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.
- **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that could hijack user sessions, steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Both SQL Injection and XSS are possible through user-provided parameters via HTML forms in both the Frontend and Backend of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data via HTML forms to the vulnerable `t3blog` extension.  This could be done from the public frontend or, for backend attacks, an attacker with access to the backend.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected versions of the `t3blog` extension are 0.6.2 and all versions below.
- A fix is available in version 0.8.0, and users are advised to update as soon as possible.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by TYPO3 Security Team member Marcus Krause, and fixed by Dmitry Dulepov.
- The advisory mentions a "critical" severity rating for the vulnerabilities.
