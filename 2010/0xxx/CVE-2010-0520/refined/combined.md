| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Quicktime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9628']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within QuickTimeAuthoring.qtx during the parsing of DELTA\_FLI chunks stored within a malformed .fli file. The applications trusts a user-supplied length for decompression which can be modified to copy more data than necessary leading to a buffer overflow. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the current user. |
