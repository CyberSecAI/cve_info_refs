Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A heap buffer overflow exists in QuickTime's handling of FLC (FLIC Animation) encoded movie files, specifically during the processing of `DELTA_FLI` chunks within the .fli file format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The application trusts a user-supplied length value for decompression, which can be modified to copy more data than necessary into a buffer, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the length value provided in the file, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious file/page.
*   **Application Termination:** An unexpected application termination can occur if the overflow causes a crash rather than code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Movie File:** A user opens a specially crafted `.fli` movie file.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** A user visits a web page hosting the malicious file that exploits the vulnerability through QuickTime.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need physical access to the targeted machine.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs user interaction to succeed i.e. tricking the user into opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious web page.
*   **Crafted File/Content:** The attacker must create a malicious `.fli` file with a manipulated length value within a `DELTA_FLI` chunk to trigger the overflow.
