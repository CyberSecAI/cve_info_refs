Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-0808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from the way Internet Explorer handles the AutoComplete feature. Specifically, it allows automated, scripted instructions to simulate user actions on the AutoComplete feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The core issue is that form data, previously entered into form fields and stored by the AutoComplete feature, can be captured.
- Improper handling of user interaction simulation on the AutoComplete feature

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could capture information previously entered into form fields if the AutoComplete feature is enabled. This could include sensitive data like usernames, passwords, addresses, or other personal information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Web Page:** An attacker could create a malicious web page designed to exploit the vulnerability. When a user visits this page via Internet Explorer, the attacker can potentially capture stored form data.
- **Compromised Web Sites:**  Attackers can also inject malicious code into legitimate, compromised web sites or websites hosting user-generated content or advertisements.
- **Email or Instant Messages:** Attackers can trick users into clicking links in emails or instant messages that lead to the attacker-controlled malicious web pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious web content.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince users to visit a malicious or compromised web page through a link or other methods.
- **Target must have AutoComplete enabled:** The user being targeted has to have the autocomplete feature enabled for this vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Information:**

- The AutoComplete feature is disabled by default.
- Microsoft was aware of public disclosure of this vulnerability but had not seen active exploitation when the associated security bulletin was issued.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" on Windows XP client systems, and "None" on Windows Server systems, in terms of severity. It should be noted that the server version of IE runs in Enhanced Security Configuration by default, which mitigates risk on those systems.

In summary, CVE-2010-0808 is an information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker to capture data previously entered into forms using the AutoComplete feature in Internet Explorer. The attack requires a user to visit a specially crafted or compromised web page, making social engineering a key element for successful exploitation.
