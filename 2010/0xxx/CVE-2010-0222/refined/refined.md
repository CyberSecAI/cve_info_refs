      "response": {
        "root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flawed implementation where the password verification and decryption process relies on a static, hardcoded key within the Windows-based software, effectively bypassing the hardware-based AES 256-bit encryption.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Use of a static, hardcoded key for decryption, making all drives vulnerable to the same exploit.",
          "Flawed password verification process, handled by software instead of the hardware.",
           "Reliance on the host computer for security, which is inherently untrustworthy."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can bypass the password protection and access encrypted data by sending a specific string that all devices use for access.",
        "attack vectors": [
          "Interception of communication between the password entry program and the USB drive.",
           "Directly sending the static unlock code to the USB drive, without needing the actual password."
        ],
         "required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to intercept the communication between the software and the drive or directly send a command to the USB drive to trigger decryption. This can be done with a small software widget. No advanced skills or resources are needed, just knowledge of the exploit."
