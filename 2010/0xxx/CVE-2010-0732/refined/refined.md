Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-0732:

**Root Cause:**
- A race condition exists between the gnome-screensaver's unlock dialog shaking animation (triggered upon incorrect password entry) and the dialog being hidden (after a set number of failed attempts). This race condition can lead to an X error due to accessing freed resources within GTK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:** The primary weakness is a race condition between the gnome-screensaver dialog's shaking animation and its termination. The dialog process could be terminated while the parent process was still attempting to manipulate its window resources, leading to a crash.
- **Improper Resource Handling:** The GTK library was not correctly handling the scenario when a foreign X window (created by a different process) is destroyed, leading to an attempt to create and free pixmaps on already destroyed drawables. Specifically, GTK+ was creating backing pixmaps for the lock dialog (a separate process), even though the dialog itself was responsible for drawing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Screen Unlock/Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation results in the gnome-screensaver process crashing. This crash unlocks the screen, allowing unauthorized access to the user's desktop.
- **Loss of Screen Lock:** After the crash, the screen cannot be locked again until the gnome-screensaver process is restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires physical access to the machine, as the attacker must interact with the lock screen.
- **Repeated Password Attempts:** The attacker must intentionally enter incorrect passwords multiple times to trigger the race condition. Pressing the return key repeatedly also triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker must be present at the computer.
- **Basic Interaction:** The attacker needs only to interact with the lock screen by entering incorrect passwords or pressing the return key.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue was initially identified in gnome-screensaver, but the root cause was determined to be in GTK+, specifically within the X11 backend.
- The fix involved preventing GTK+ from performing implicit painting (double-buffering) on foreign windows (windows from separate processes), thus avoiding the creation of a pixmap on a resource that may have been freed.
- Additionally a patch was applied to gnome-screensaver to prevent the dialog process from exiting before the main screensaver process had completed all its actions. Instead of exiting after 5 wrong attempts, the dialog process would request termination from the main screensaver process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in gnome-screensaver versions prior to 2.28.1 and GTK+ versions prior to the fix commit.
- The issue was initially reported on openSUSE 11.2 but also affected other distributions.
- The fix was implemented in both the gnome-screensaver (to address the immediate issue) and in the GTK library (to prevent such problems in the future).
- Red Hat classified this as a "NOTABUG" because the core issue was in GTK+.
- Some initial reports mistakenly suggested that incorrect password attempts greater than 5 were required but later it was discovered that the race condition could occur with any number of incorrect attempts.
