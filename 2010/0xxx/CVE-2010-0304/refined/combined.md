Package        : wireshark
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-4337 CVE-2010-0304

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4337

    A NULL pointer dereference was found in the SMB/SMB2 dissectors.

CVE-2010-0304

    Several buffer overflows were found in the LWRES dissector.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-3+lenny8.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Wireshark packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

# Wireshark LWRES Dissector getaddrsbyname\_request Buffer Overflow

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### Wireshark LWRES Dissector getaddrsbyname\_request Buffer Overflow

Disclosed
01/27/2010

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

The LWRES dissector in Wireshark version 0.9.15 through 1.0.10 and 1.2.0 through
1.2.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to a stack-based buffer
overflow. This bug found and reported by babi.
This particular exploit targets the dissect\_getaddrsbyname\_request function. Several
other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows.
The Windows version (of 1.2.5 at least) is compiled with /GS, which prevents
exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows
exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However, this packet will usually get
fragmented, which may cause additional complications.
NOTE: The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered.
If the packet is fragmented, all fragments must be captured and reassembled to
exploit this issue.

#### Author(s)

* babi
* jduck <jduck@metasploit.com>
* redsand

#### Platform

Linux,OSX,Windows

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/multi/misc/wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname
msf exploit(wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
