Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `com_gcalendar` component of Joomla!.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application fails to properly sanitize user input when handling the `controller` parameter in the URL. This allows an attacker to include local files on the server by injecting directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) into the parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can read sensitive files on the server. This could include configuration files, database credentials, source code, or other critical data, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable `com_gcalendar` component and a manipulated `controller` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla! application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not seem to require any prior authentication, making it exploitable to anyone with network access to the affected application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `controller` parameter within the URL of the `com_gcalendar` component.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The exploit uses directory traversal sequences like `../../` within the `controller` parameter to navigate to arbitrary files in the server's file system.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The exploit utilizes the null byte `%00` to possibly truncate the path after the attacker-controlled part to ensure the inclusion of the desired file and avoid errors.

**Example Exploit:**

The provided exploit URL from exploit-db.com shows how to exploit the vulnerability:

```
http://site/index.php?option=com_gcalendar&controller=../../../../../etc/passwd%00
```

This URL attempts to include the `/etc/passwd` file from the server by using directory traversal and null byte injection.
