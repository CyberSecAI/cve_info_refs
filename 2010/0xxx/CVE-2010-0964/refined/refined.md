Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-0964

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `start.php` script of the Eros Erotik Webkatalog application. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (usernames, passwords, emails), application data, etc.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify or delete database records.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request containing a malicious SQL query within the vulnerable `id` parameter of the `start.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No special access to the server is required beyond network connectivity to the server.
*   Knowledge of SQL syntax is necessary to craft an effective injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable URL Parameter:** `id` in `start.php?go=rubrik&id=`
*   **Exploit Example:** `www.site.com/webkatalog/start.php?go=rubrik&id=-1+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,concat(id,0x3a,vorname,0x3a,passwort,0x3,mail),11,12,13,14,15+from+php005_4_eintrag--`
    * This example uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `php005_4_eintrag` table (likely a user table), specifically concatenating `id`, `vorname` (first name), `passwort` (password), and `mail`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit example provided is quite detailed and showcases a practical attack vector and payload.
*   The exploit code provides information on the vulnerable script and application details, which is useful for identification and verification.
