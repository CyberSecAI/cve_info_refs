Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2010-0849:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `JPEGImageDecoderImpl` interface of the Java 2D component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business. This interface is used for decoding JPEG images.
*   A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in a decoding routine used by the `JPEGImageDecoderImpl` interface. This is caused by an issue related to how a crafted JPEG image is processed.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, which can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Improper handling of crafted JPEG images:** The vulnerability arises due to how the `JPEGImageDecoderImpl` handles specially crafted JPEG images, specifically during the decoding process.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially execute malicious code on the affected system with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impact:** As stated in the provided content, an attacker could affect all three areas.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Malicious Java applet:**  The primary attack vector involves a malicious Java applet.
*   **User interaction required:** The user must be coerced into visiting a web page containing a maliciously crafted Java applet in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** An attacker can exploit this remotely.
*   **Ability to craft a malicious JPEG:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a JPEG image that triggers the overflow.
*   **Ability to host a malicious website or inject the payload into a legitimate site:** The attacker must have a means of delivering the malicious applet to the victim. This is usually through a website.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a "heap-based buffer overflow in a decoding routine used by the JPEGImageDecoderImpl interface, which allows code execution via a crafted JPEG image".
*   The content indicates that the flaw involves abusing an object used to specify parameters for the JPEG decoder which then leads to the heap overflow.
*   The vulnerability affects Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and 1.3.1\_27.
*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) also reported this vulnerability as ZDI-10-057.
*   Several vendors including Apple, Red Hat, and SUSE also acknowledged the CVE and released patches.
