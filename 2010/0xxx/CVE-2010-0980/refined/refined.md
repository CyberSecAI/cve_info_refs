Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-0980:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The Left 4 Dead Stats application suffers from a remote SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in the `player.php` script. Specifically, the `steamid` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsanitized user input in the `steamid` parameter within the `player.php` script.
- The application directly incorporates the unsanitized `steamid` parameter into an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database.
- This could lead to various impacts, including:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive data stored in the database.
    - Data modification: Altering or deleting database records.
    - Potential for complete database compromise and server takeover (depending on the database permissions and application setup).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack via HTTP request.
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `steamid` parameter in the URL when accessing the `player.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No special privileges or local access is required. The attacker can be remote.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit is triggered by inserting a single quote (') character in the `steamid` parameter, such as in the provided PoC: `http://www.site.com/l4dstats/player.php?steamid='`
- This injection will cause a syntax error in the underlying SQL query, which is an indicator of the vulnerability.
- The attacker can then further manipulate the injected SQL to extract or alter data.
- The vulnerable application is "Left 4 Dead Stats 1.1" a PHP-based web application

**Mitigation:**
- The suggested solution is to sanitize the database inputs to prevent SQL injection. This typically involves using parameterized queries or input validation to ensure that user-provided data cannot be interpreted as SQL code.
