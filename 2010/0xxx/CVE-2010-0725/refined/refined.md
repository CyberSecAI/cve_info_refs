Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-0725:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Application:** Arab Cart Version 1.0.2.0
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:  The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `showimg.php` script is vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `showimg.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *  **Blind SQL/XPath Injection:** The `showimg.php` script is vulnerable to Blind SQL/XPath injection
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or malware distribution.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
	*  **Blind SQL/XPath Injection:** Allows an attacker to potentially extract data from database using boolean based or time based exploitation
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  The primary attack vector is through crafted requests to the `showimg.php` script, by manipulating the `id` parameter
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No other specific privileges or positioning is mentioned.

**Technical Details:**

*   **XSS Example:**
    `http://server/arabCart/showimg.php?id=<img+src=http://server/acrobat.gif+onload=alert(213771818860)>&sid=8207c6aca4d21740c20f51527ccb3f7a`
    This URL demonstrates injecting JavaScript code that would execute an alert box when the image loads.
*   **SQL Injection Example:**
    `http://server/arabCart/showimg.php?id=%00'`
    This demonstrates an attempt to inject a SQL query by using a null byte and a single quote in the `id` parameter
*  **Blind SQL/XPath Injection Example:**
    `http://server/arabCart/showimg.php?id=8+and+31337-31337=0+--+`
    This URL shows an example of exploiting blind SQL injection using an arithmetic comparison which can be used to determine if the condition is true or false.
