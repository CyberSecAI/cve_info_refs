  "CVE-2010-0001": {
    "description": "An integer underflow leading to array index error was found in the way gzip used to decompress files / archives, compressed with the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) compression algorithm. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted LZW compressed gzip archive, which once decompressed by a local, unsuspecting user would lead to gzip crash, or, potentially to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gzip.",
