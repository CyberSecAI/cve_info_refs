    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-0019",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Silverlight handles pointers. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user visits a specially crafted Web site that contains Silverlight content.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way that Silverlight handles pointers. When Silverlight parses specially crafted Silverlight code, a memory corruption can occur that may either cause Silverlight to stop responding, or allow code execution.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Memory Corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote code execution in the context of the currently logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to visit the Web site. This could also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would have to convince users to visit the malicious website, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message."
