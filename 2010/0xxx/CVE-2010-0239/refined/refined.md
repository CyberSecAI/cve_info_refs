  "vulnerability_information": {
    "CVE-2010-0239": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient bounds checking in the Windows TCP/IP stack when processing specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain complete control of an affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets to a computer with IPv6 enabled. Exploitation may only be possible if the attacker is on-link (same physical or virtual link as target). Tunneling protocols, such as ISATAP, may allow attackers to deliver the packets even if not on the same physical link.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network segment or virtual link (e.g. ISATAP tunnel) as the target and needs the ability to send IPv6 ICMP packets."
