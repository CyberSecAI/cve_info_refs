    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way xpdf parses the xref table in PDF files. Specifically, it involves an infinite loop during the parsing process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability during xref table parsing."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, causing the application to crash by exhausting stack memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted PDF file with a circular reference in the xref table is required.",
        "The attack requires the user to open the crafted PDF file using a vulnerable xpdf-based viewer."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file with a crafted xref table.",
    "additional_information": "The issue was classified as 'just a crasher', not considered a security issue by some vendors"
