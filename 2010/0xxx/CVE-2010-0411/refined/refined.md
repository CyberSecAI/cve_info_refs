{
  "CVE-2010-0411": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the __get_argv() function of systemtap's tapset. The function improperly handles the return code from strlcpy(), leading to a potential buffer overflow when copying multiple argv strings. This can be triggered by a systemtap script using the __get_argv() function or the syscall.execve probe point when processing long arguments lists, leading to a system crash due to memory corruption.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of the strlcpy() function within the __get_argv() function of systemtap's tapset. Specifically, the return value of strlcpy(), which represents the length of the source string and not the number of bytes copied, is misinterpreted as the number of bytes copied.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of return value from strlcpy() function",
        "Buffer overflow due to incorrect length calculations"
       ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a crash due to memory corruption when systemtap scripts use __get_argv(), allowing an attacker to cause denial of service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Executing a systemtap script that uses __get_argv() or the probe point syscall.execve",
	"Starting processes with very long argument lists when a vulnerable systemtap script is active"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute a specially crafted systemtap script and/or execute processes with very long argument lists. This does not require elevated privileges to execute. A normal user could perform the actions."
