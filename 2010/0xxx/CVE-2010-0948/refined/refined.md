Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-0948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `profil.php` file of BigForum version 4.5. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `profil.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries. The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to extract sensitive information from the database. In this specific exploit, the attacker retrieves the `id`, `username`, and `password` of the admin user.
- **Potential for further compromise:** This initial access to the database could potentially lead to more serious consequences, such as privilege escalation, data manipulation, or even complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a malicious HTTP GET request targeting the `profil.php` script with a specially crafted `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details (from exploit):**

- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id` parameter in `profil.php`
- **Exploit Technique:** `UNION SELECT` based SQL injection
- **Specific Payload:**
   `'-1'+union+select+1,concat(0x3a3a3a,id,0x3a,username,0x3a,pw,0x3a3a3a),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29+from+users`
- **Requirement:** Magic Quotes must be off on the server.
