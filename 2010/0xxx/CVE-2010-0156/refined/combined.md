1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel
This update adds support for RFC5746 TLS renegotiations to address
vulnerabilities tracked as (CVE-2009-3555).

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

Puppet 0.25.2 - code-named "Zoe"

The 0.25.2 release is a significant maintenance release (123 tickets
closed!) in the 0.25.x branch.

Thanks to all who contributed to the release and tested fixes -
especially (but not limited to!) Peter Meier (duritong), R.I.
Pienaar (Volcane), Mark Plaskin, Dan Bode, Alan Harder, Ricky Zhou,
Christian Hofstaedtler, Todd Zullinger, Till Mass, Nigel Kersten,
and especially Markus Roberts and Jesse Wolfe who worked around the
clock to get the release out the door.

The release is available at:

<http://reductivelabs.com/downloads/puppet/puppet-0.25.2.tar.gz>
<http://reductivelabs.com/downloads/puppet/puppet-0.25.2.gem>

Please note that all future final releases of Puppet will be signed
with the Reductive Labs key. Unfortunately, I am travelling and
unable to access to the box with the release key on it or its
backup. A signature will be generated for this release early next
week when I return to Australia.

<http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/DownloadingPuppet#verifying-puppet-downloads>

Please report feedback via the Reductive Labs Redmine site:

<http://projects.reductivelabs.com>

Please select an affected version of 0.25.2.

RELEASE NOTES

\* When setting aliases using the host type now use the host\_alias
attribute rather than alias.

\* Puppet now has the "manage\_internal\_file\_permissions" option which
allows you to enable or disable Puppet management of internal files,
for example those in /var/lib/puppet. When "false" Puppet will NOT
manage these files. Default is "true".

\* Cron type now supported on AIX

\* Mailist type is now working again

\* File serving permissions error messages enhanced

\* SELinux now supports contexts with upper case titles

\* When running the tests you no longer need to use RSpec version
1.2.2 but rather versions including and newer than.

\* The debug format message has been changed and clarified from:

debug: Format s not supported for Puppet::FileServing::Metadata; has
not implemented method 'from\_s'

to:

debug: file\_metadata supports formats: b64\_zlib\_yaml marshal pson
raw yaml; using pson

\* Puppetdoc now works with Regex node names

\* There are now valid and proper OIDs in the LDAP puppet.schema that
are unique and registered for Puppet.

\* Packagers please note updated man pages including a new page for
puppetqd

\* Fix for temporary file issues
(<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=502881>)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c0)  Till Maas    2009-05-27 15:39:47 UTC  ``` Description of problem: I noticed that puppet may create several predictable files in /tmp, e.g.  /tmp/daemonout /tmp/puppetdoc.txt /tmp/puppetdoc.tex  There are also a lot more in the tests, but they may not be run in Fedora's F10 spec, and even more in the puppet source, e.g. for the dmg installation provider.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): puppet-0.24.8-1.fc10  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. grep -nR /tmp/ /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet  Actual results: Contains ruby code like: /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/daemon.rb:33:            File.open("/tmp/daemonout", "w") { |f|  Expected results: Should only report findings that are not executed, e.g. in comments or help information  Additional info: Current git seems to contain even more issues, e.g.  lib/puppet/network/server.rb:25:            File.open("/tmp/daemonout", "w") { |f|   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c1)  Jeroen van Meeuwen    2009-06-24 14:27:38 UTC  ``` This is an issue the file already exists, with arbitrary content and only with permissive permissions, am I right?  Would it help to put these files in, say, 0750, puppet:puppet, /var/cache/puppet/, so that only the puppet user (and root) can write to these files?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c2)  Till Maas    2009-06-27 15:50:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c1)) > This is an issue the file already exists, with arbitrary content and only with > permissive permissions, am I right?  I do not understand this question. But a typical attack in this case would be to create a symlink in e.g. /tmp/daemonout that points to a file that only root can write to, to manipulate the contents of this file.  > Would it help to put these files in, say, 0750, puppet:puppet, > /var/cache/puppet/, so that only the puppet user (and root) can write to these > files?    /tmp/daemonout should probably be in /var/log or some puppet log file should be used instead imho. For the puppetdoc and test files the Tempfile class in ruby should be used to generate securely temporary files or maybe a temporary directory within /tmp. The class Tempfile is already used in other locations in puppet.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c3)  Jeroen van Meeuwen    2009-08-12 23:00:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c2)) > (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c1)) > > This is an issue the file already exists, with arbitrary content and only with > > permissive permissions, am I right? >  > I do not understand this question.

The same file system permissions apply to files and directories created in /tmp/ as do they anywhere else. The only difference with /tmp/ is that anyone can create files there, and anyone can list the directories content;  With umask, files created in /tmp/ would not even be group-readable or writeable:  == Every 1.0s: find /tmp/ -name *puppet* -exec ls -lh {} \;                                                                                                                                                            Thu Aug 13 00:12:39 2009  -rw-------. 1 root root 0 2009-08-13 00:12 ./puppet.15122.0 ==  I fail to see how this is a security problem, unless the file is created with extraneous permissions before the puppet daemon creates the file itself.

Here are some step by step instructions, that hopefull help to understand the problem:  1) backup your /etc/shadow file, e.g. with cp /etc/shadow /root/shadow.puppet-backup 2) As a non root user run: ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/puppet.tex 3) As root run: puppetdoc -m pdf 4) notice that /etc/shadow has been overwritten with latex code: less /etc/shadow 5) restore /etc/shadow: cp /root/shadow.puppet-backup /etc/shadow  > If you can explain or give me some reference I'll be happy to read up ;-)    <http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/27.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c5)  Jeroen van Meeuwen    2009-08-13 21:58:14 UTC  ``` So, a form of understanding is in my brain now...  Would the solution be to not use /tmp/, but some directory non-root users cannot just write to (cannot create symbolic links to other files in)?  I'd suggest:   puppet:puppet drwxr-x--- /var/run/puppet  or something similar?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c6)  Till Maas    2009-08-14 13:36:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c5)) > So, a form of understanding is in my brain now... >  > Would the solution be to not use /tmp/, but some directory non-root users > cannot just write to (cannot create symbolic links to other files in)? >  > I'd suggest: >  >  puppet:puppet drwxr-x--- /var/run/puppet >  > or something similar?    Basically I already answerded this in comment:2, but I can also provide more details if needed:  /tmp/daemonout is a logfile and should got to /var/log, the other files should be created using the ruby tempfile class[0] or using a temporary directory, e.g. for the pdf creation there are iirc also some other helper files created with the same basename, e.g. instead of /tmp/puppetdoc.tex /tmp/puppetdoc.aux can probably also be used.

Approximately 30 (thirty) days from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 10.  It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained.  At that time this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '10'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 10's end of life.  Bug Reporter: Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that  we may not be able to fix it before Fedora 10 is end of life.  If you  would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it  against a later version of Fedora please change the 'version' of this  bug to the applicable version.  If you are unable to change the version,  please add a comment here and someone will do it for you.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events.  Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.  The process we are following is described here:  <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers/HouseKeeping>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c8)  Bug Zapper    2009-12-18 09:29:48 UTC  ```  Fedora 10 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2009-12-17. Fedora 10 is  no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further  security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c9)  Till Maas    2010-01-03 22:14:00 UTC  ``` reproduced exploit from comment:4 with /tmp/puppetdoc.tex in step 2 with puppet-0.24.8-4.fc12   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c10)  Till Maas    2010-01-03 23:24:59 UTC  ``` add co-maintainer Todd M.

I guess it needs to, since the file may also be a Puppet file created during a previous (aborted?) run...   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c14)  Todd Zullinger    2010-01-04 17:23:18 UTC  ``` James, thanks to you and Markus for the quick work.  I tested a little on CentOS 5 and Fedora 10 (I'm travelling and don't have handy access to an F-12 box with 0.25.x right now).  I only tested puppetdoc, and noted that while the patch from Markus prevents the tmp file problem, it does result in a traceback rather than a simple warning as I think is intended:  [root@localhost ~]# echo 'Secret root stuff' > /etc/test [root@localhost ~]# chmod 400 /etc/test  [user@localhost ~]$ ln -sv /etc/test /tmp/puppetdoc.tex  [root@localhost ~]# puppetdoc -m pdf creating pdf /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/util.rb:411:in `secure_open': private method `warn' called for Puppet:Module (NoMethodError) 	from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/util/reference.rb:51:in `pdf' 	from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/application/puppetdoc.rb:160:in `other' 	from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/application.rb:226:in `send' 	from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/application.rb:226:in `run_command' 	from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/application.rb:217:in `run' 	from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/application.rb:306:in `exit_on_fail' 	from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/puppet/application.rb:217:in `run' 	from /usr/bin/puppetdoc:65  I'm not sure how to quickly test the other code paths and I don't have as much time as I'd like to look into it.  But I will try and test anything if you or Markus have suggestions.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c15)  James Turnbull    2010-01-04 17:32:46 UTC  ``` Todd - we'll do some more testing and get back to you.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c16)  James Turnbull    2010-01-04 17:58:17 UTC  ``` Try the updated fix in that same branch.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=502881#c17)  Todd Zullinger    2010-01-04 19:56:02 UTC  ``` James, no traceback with the typo fixed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
