{
  "CVE-2010-0166": {
    "description": "Jesse Ruderman reported a crash in the browser engine which affected Firefox 3.6 for Mac only.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises in the `gfxTextRun::SanitizeGlyphRuns` function. When this function deletes the last glyph run from the array, it fails to update the `lastRunIndex` variable. Consequently, on the next iteration, the function attempts to access a now invalid memory location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper array index handling",
      "Use of dangling pointer/invalid index"
     ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to an assertion failure and a crash in debug builds. It is presumed that, under certain circumstances, this vulnerability could be exploited to run arbitrary code due to potential memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by the presence of specific Unicode characters (U+FEFF, FFF9, FFFA, FFFB) in the text being rendered. These characters cause `SanitizeGlyphRuns` to delete glyph runs and trigger the out-of-bounds access.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject or cause the rendering of text containing the specific Unicode characters (U+FEFF, FFF9, FFFA, FFFB). This could potentially be achieved via a malicious webpage or other content."
