To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ncpfs, Multiple Vulnerabilities

---

*From*: Dan Rosenberg <dan.j.rosenberg () gmail com>

*Date*: Fri, 5 Mar 2010 12:06:01 -0500

```
============================================
 ncpfs, Multiple Vulnerabilities
 March 5, 2010
 CVE-2010-0788, CVE-2010-0790, CVE-2010-0791
============================================

==Description==

The ncpmount, ncpumount, and ncplogin utilities, installed as part of the ncpfs
package, contain several vulnerabilities.

1. ncpmount, ncpumount, and ncplogin are vulnerable to race conditions that
allow a local attacker to unmount arbitrary mountpoints, causing
denial-of-service, or mount Netware shares to arbitrary directories,
potentially leading to root compromise.  This issue was formerly assigned
CVE-2009-3297, but has since been re-assigned CVE-2010-0788 to avoid overlap
with related bugs in other packages.

2. ncpumount is vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability that
allows a local attacker to verify the existence of arbitrary files, violating
directory permissions.  This issue has been assigned CVE-2010-0790.

3. ncpmount, ncpumount, and ncplogin create lockfiles insecurely, allowing a
local attacker to leave a stale lockfile at /etc/mtab~, causing other mount
utilities to fail and creating denial-of-service conditions.  This issue has
been assigned CVE-2010-0791.

==Workaround==

If unprivileged users do not need the ability to mount and unmount Netware
shares, then the suid bit should be removed from these utilities.

==Solution==

A patch has been released that resolves these issues (attached to this
advisory).  ncpfs-2.2.6.partial.patch is intended for ncpfs releases that have
already been patched against the first vulnerability in this report
(CVE-2010-0788, formerly CVE-2009-3297).  It has been tested against the latest
ncpfs packages distributed by Fedora, Red Hat, and Mandriva.
ncpfs-2.2.6.full.patch is intended for ncpfs releases that have not been
patched against any of these vulnerabilities.  It has been tested against the
latest ncpfs packages distributed by Debian, Ubuntu, and the upstream release
(ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/).

Users are advised to recompile from source, or request updated packages from
downstream distributors.

==Credits==

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Dan Rosenberg
(dan.j.rosenberg () gmail com).
Thanks to Vitezslav Crhonek for the patch against the first issue.

==References==

CVE identifiers CVE-2010-0788, CVE-2010-0790, and CVE-2010-0791 have been
assigned to these issues.

Local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks, leading to disclosure of  sensitive information, or, possibly to privilege escalation.     Upstream bug report:        <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6853>        Upstream Samba patches:        <http://git.samba.org/?p=samba.git;a=commit;h=3ae5dac462c4ed0fb2cd94553583c56fce2f9d80> <http://git.samba.org/?p=samba.git;a=commit;h=a065c177dfc8f968775593ba00dffafeebb2e054> <http://git.samba.org/?p=samba.git;a=commit;h=a0c31ec1c8d1220a5884e40d9ba6b191a04a24d5>     Issue severity note for Red Hat Enteprise Linux:    ------------------------------------------------           The mount.cifs binary, as shipped within samba-client package on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, is NOT shipped with setuid root bit enabled by default (local, unprivileged users on these systems are NOT able to mount custom CIFS filesystem shares), which mitigates the impact of the vulnera- bility.  b, Dan Rosenberg found a race condition in the FUSE's fusermount's utility by performing FUSE filesystem(s) unmount operation (it was not performed atomically). A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (unprivileged unmount of FUSE filesystem share(s) owned by privileged user) via symlink attack involving FUSE share(s) belonging to privileged user.     Issue severity note for Red Hat Enterprise Linux:    -------------------------------------------------       The  "fusermount" utility, as shipped within "fuse" package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 IS shipped with setuid root bit  enabled by default, but the unprivileged user to be able to mount custom FUSE filesystem, he needs prior to be the member of special "fuse" users group (user membership in this group is granted by privileged user), which mitigates the impact of the vulnerability.  c, Dan Rosenberg found race conditions in the ncpfs ncpmount  and ncpumount utilities. Local, unprivileged user could use these flaws to conduct symlink attacks, leading to denial of service (ncpumount), disclosure of sensitive information, or, possibly to privilege escalation (ncpmount).     Issue severity note for Fedora:    -------------------------------       The "ncpmount and ncpumount" utilities, as shipped within "ncpfs" package in Fedora release of 11 and 12 are NOT shipped with setuid root bit enabled by default (unprivileged, local users are NOT able to mount / umount custom remote NCP shares), which mitigates the impact of the flaws.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for responsibly reporting these flaws.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=532940#c13)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-01-25 10:22:52 UTC  ``` Vulnerable package versions:  a, samba-client (mount.cifs)     This issue affects the versions of the samba-client package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5. Though the "mount.cifs" binary on these systems is NOT shipped with setuid root bit enabled by default (unprivileged user is NOT able to mount custom CIFS shares), which mitigates the impact of the vulnerability.     This issue affects the versions of the samba-client package, as shipped with Fedora 11 and 12. "mount.cifs" binary is NOT shipped with setuid root bit enabled on these systems.  b, fuse (fusermount -u)    This issue affects the version of the "fuse" package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. "fusermount" binary IS shipped with setuid root bit enabled on Red Hat Enteprise Linux 5, but unprivileged user, to be able to mount custom FUSE filesystem shares, need first to be member of special "fuse" group (privilege provided by the privileged user), which mitigates the impact of this vulnerability.    This issue affects the versions of the "fuse" package, as shipped with Fedora release of 11 and 12.  c, ncpfs (ncpmount, ncpumount)    These issues affect the versions of the ncpfs package, as shipped with Fedora release of 11 and 12. The "ncpmount / ncpumount" binaries are NOT shipped with setuid root bit enabled by default (unprivileged user is NOT able to mount / umount custom remote NCP protocol shares), which mitigates the impact of the vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=532940#c19)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-26 16:07:11 UTC  ``` ncpfs-2.2.6-13.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ncpfs-2.2.6-13.fc12>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=532940#c21)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-26 16:29:29 UTC  ``` ncpfs-2.2.6-12.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ncpfs-2.2.6-12.fc11>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=532940#c25)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-27 17:41:56 UTC  ``` samba-3.4.5-55.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/samba-3.4.5-55.fc12>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=532940#c26)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-27 17:46:52 UTC  ``` samba-3.4.5-0.47.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/samba-3.4.5-0.47.fc11>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=532940#c27)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-28 00:57:02 UTC  ``` ncpfs-2.2.6-13.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.

Instead, new CVEs have been assigned as follows:  CVE-2010-0787: samba CVE-2010-0788: ncpfs CVE-2010-0789: fuse   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=532940#c35)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-02 21:57:40 UTC  ``` For Samba:  This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 by default as mount.cifs is not provided with the setuid bit enabled.  If a user has turned on the setuid bit (via 'chmod +s /sbin/mount.cifs'), they would be affected by this issue and can workaround the problem by removing the setuid bit.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 does not provide the mount.cifs program.  For FUSE:  This issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 because it does ship fusermount suid root, however the impact of this flaw is minimized due to the fact that only members in group 'fuse' may use it; the executable is owned root:fuse and mode 4750.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 do not provide the fuse package.  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.  More information regarding issue severity can be found here:  <http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=532940#c36)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-26 16:02:33 UTC  ``` This bug has been split out so that each CVE has its own bug.  Please see:  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-0787> for Samba  and  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-0789> for fuse  As updated packages for ncpfs have been pushed for Fedora, this bug is resolved.   ``` |  |

- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
