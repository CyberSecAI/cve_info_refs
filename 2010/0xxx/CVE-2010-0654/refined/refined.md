{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the lax parsing of CSS by browsers, where the CSS parser will skip over any amount of preceding or trailing junk data in its quest to find a valid CSS selector. This allows an attacker to inject malicious CSS into a page by inserting what appears to be a valid CSS string within arbitrary data.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The CSS parser ignores leading and trailing non-CSS data.",
    "Browsers send cookies with any CSS load, including cross-domain.",
    "Browsers do not enforce strict MIME type checking when loading CSS resources across domains in quirks mode."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can potentially steal sensitive data from a vulnerable domain by injecting a CSS `background-image:url()` rule.  The URL will contain the exfiltrated data and the browser will send a GET request to the attacker's server, revealing the data within the URL path. This can include anti-XSRF tokens, user-specific data, and other confidential information.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker injects a malicious CSS string into a vulnerable website and forces the user to load this manipulated page. The injected CSS loads a background image from the attacker's domain, with the path of the URL containing the stolen data, which is then visible in the attacker's server logs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to inject arbitrary text into the target domain's data (e.g., via user comments, email subject lines, JSON/XML feeds, URL parameters).",
    "Control over a separate domain where they can host a server to receive the stolen data.",
    "Must be able to get the victim to load a page that includes the injected css."
