{
  "CVE-2010-0741": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way the QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the guest Linux virtio-net driver. Due deficiency in the implementation of the TSO (TCP segment offloading), the guest's virtio-net driver transmitted improper data to the particular QEMU-KVM process on the host, resulting in its termination. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service (guest crash) by sending certain, specially-crafted data to arbitrary open port on the target guest system.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is a deficiency in the implementation of TCP segment offloading (TSO) in the Linux virtio-net driver. This caused the driver to send improper data to QEMU-KVM.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of erroneous data",
      "Deficient TCP segment offloading (TSO) implementation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the guest operating system.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could send specially crafted data to an arbitrary open port on the target guest system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the targeted guest."
