```

It was acking VBAD_FEATURE when I tested it.

But if you look at the patch, it whitelists the following features:

   features |= (1 << VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC);
   features |= (1 << VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_CSUM);
   features |= (1 << VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_TSO4);
   features |= (1 << VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_TSO6);
   features |= (1 << VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_ECN);

```
Which is why it's ack'ing TSO4. Removing TSO4 didn't seem to fix it
for me.
```

Anthony Liguori

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-06-16 16:43:15 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM) handled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an image or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely deleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a new, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it, could use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs, potentially disclosing sensitive information.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-22 12:44:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0473 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0473.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=604752#c3)  Mark J.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-03-26 13:35:31 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the guest Linux virtio-net driver. Due deficiency in the implementation of the TSO (TCP segment offloading), the guest's virtio-net driver transmitted improper data to the particular QEMU-KVM process on the host, resulting in its termination. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service (guest crash) by sending certain, specially-crafted data to arbitrary open port on the target guest system.  A remote attacker could exploit this to crash guests which use virtio networking on Linux kernels earlier than 2.6.26.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-30 07:51:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0271 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0271.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c7)  Yewei Shao    2010-06-17 14:41:14 UTC  ``` Change the bug to verified according to the [bug 577243#c7](show_bug.cgi?id=577243#c7).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c8)  Yewei Shao    2010-06-17 14:42:14 UTC  ``` Update the [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c7):  Change the bug to verified according to the [bug 577243#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=577243#c4).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-22 13:54:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0476 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0476.html>   ``` |  |

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: kvm

I was running a kvm host with 5 virtual machines using jaunty. 1 running centos 5.4, 3 running karmic and 1 running hardy.

I upgraded the host to karmic to test it and one of my virtual machines(the vm with hardy) crashs after some seconds of boot! I stack traced the kvm process and found a "virtio-net truncating packet" before process crash.

No error in any log file. The VM just crash.

I changed the model of network interface(the disk is still virtio) in VM.xml to rtl8139, redefined and started. The problem goes away.

I don't know if it's a kvm bug or libvirt(regarding the bridge network) bug but definitely is a bug. All other VMs are running OK with virtio for both network and disk.

===========================

Karmic Release Notes:

KVM Guest Crashes when Guest is Hardy and using Virtio Networking

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy) KVM guests using virtio networking may crash, when running on top of Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) hosts.

As a workaround, such guests should use either e1000 or rtl839 as the networking model. A fix for the bug is currently in progress and should be addressed in an update to the qemu-kvm package in Karmic.

===========================

===========================

SRU Justification

This bug is a regression from the kvm-84 package in 9.04. Karmic users hosting 8.04 KVM guests and using virtio networking \*will\* crash their VM when the network connection is saturated. As the virtual machine crashes without sync buffers, there could very well be data lost in the guest filesystem or memory.

I have posted the patch for review, and acked upstream:

 \* <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2009-10/msg02495.html>

I am bundling this fix with two other minor fixes, for [Bug #452323](/bugs/452323) and [Bug #453441](/bugs/453441).

TEST CASE:

 1) Download and uncompress

  \* <http://rookery.canonical.com/~kirkland/hardy.img.bz2>

 2) Download a bridged networking script

  \* <http://rookery.canonical.com/~kirkland/bridge.sh>

 3) Start the vm with virtio and bridged networking

  \* sudo /usr/bin/kvm -m 512 -net nic,model=virtio -net tap,script=bridge.sh -drive file=hardy.img,if=virtio,index=0,boot=on

 4) The VM's username and password are both "ubuntu".

 5) In the guest, have nc listen on a port

  \* nc -lp 1234 > /dev/null

 6) On your host, flood the guest with network traffic on that port

  \* cat /dev/urandom | nc -w 3 guest\_ip 1234

 7) Without this fix, the guest will crash immediately, saying:

  \* virtio-net truncating packet

 8) With the fix, you will be able to send the guest with data over the virtio network ad nauseum. I get about 6MB/s throughput.

I also upgraded my VM host to karmic this weekend.

My hardy guest (which generally has months of uptime), cannot stay up for more than a few hours (~11 hours) before crashing.

I'm looking into this.

Okay, I can reproduce this very easily by saturating the guest's INCOMING network connection, with:

user@guest$ nc -lp 1234 > /dev/null

and

user@host$ cat /dev/urandom | nc -w 3 guest\_ip 1234

In less than a second of sending, the vm crashes with:

  virtio-net truncating packet

Note that I have not reproduced the problem saturating the guest's OUTGOING network.

I have uploaded a full-updated Ubuntu 8.04.3 (Hardy) image (user=ubuntu,pw=ubuntu) that I'm using to reproduce this at:

Huh?

This isn't a patch for the hardy kernel...

Accepted qemu-kvm into karmic-proposed, the package will build now and be available in a few hours. Please test and give feedback here. See <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed> for documentation how to enable and use -proposed. Thank you in advance!

This bug is actually security-critical. I'm copying the Ubuntu-Security team, and updating the changelog for security update publication.

Basically, a guest running virtio networking and a linux kernel <= 2.6.25 (eg hardy) can be remotely DoS'd by any other user on the network flooding an open network port (eg 22) with traffic. The DoS causes crash in the kvm process. Because the guest's operating system was not shut down cleanly, unwritten buffers or dirty filesystem operations could yield data loss in the guest.

Attaching a debdiff for the security team to upload to the security-prosed pocket.

I just added a new task, triaged/high against hardy's linux kernel.

The Hardy linux kernel uses a backport of 2.6.25's virtio-net implementation that causes this bug.

This virtio-net driver needs to be fixed such that hardy vm guests using virtio-net doesn't truncate packets and crash hypervisors.

This appears to be fixed in virtio-net implementations later than 2.6.25, so I think we either need to sync this driver with a new release, or cherry-pick the fixes that solve this.

Assigning to jj. Hopefully he can knock this out easily.

Okay, I ran these tests myself, and verified that the current package in karmic-proposed solves the issue.

Can I get some help from someone else out there? Ideally, the original bug reporter will be able to validate the fix. Trunet?

I enabled karmic-proposed and installed the qemu-kvm and kvm package from there. The problem goes away and my VMs are ok for 8 hours from now with virtio in network interfaces.

I installed the package from proposed and it solved the problem for me. I ran the test provided in this bug report and some file tranfers with scp that used to crash and it worked flawlessly.

I installed Hardy as a guest on KVM on RH 5.4 using bridge networking. System will reboot as soon as I tried to pull in a file via either ftp, nfs or scp. Just changed back to virtual networking and the problem goes away. This severly limits my ability to have the guest be accessed externally.

I went back and retested this and it has already been fixed and released (commit fcbc05a1be0a7600153e78207dcb8b62fe753a4a), it was just not properly closed.

mapl,

If you are running an updated hardy guest running the 2.6.24-29 kernel this bug should not be a problem. Can you please provide information on which kernel you are using. If you are still encountering a problem with an updated kernel this is a new bug and we will need to gather more information to reproduce.

Subject: CVE-2010-0741 qemu: Improper handling of erroneous data provided by
 Linux virtio-net driver

Hello vendors,

    Josh Bressers has assigned a CVE id CVE-2010-0741 to the following bug:

A flaw was found in the way the QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided
by the guest Linux virtio-net driver. Due deficiency in the implementation
of the TSO (TCP segment offloading), the guest's virtio-net driver
transmitted improper data to the particular QEMU-KVM process on the host,
resulting in its termination. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
cause denial of service (guest crash) by sending certain,
specially-crafted data to arbitrary open port on the target guest system.

A remote attacker could exploit this to crash guests which use virtio
networking on Linux kernels earlier than 2.6.26.

Note that this was previously reported in Canonical's launchpad but no CVE
name was ever assigned AFAIK.

whitelist host virtio networking features

This patch is a followup to 8eca6b1bc770982595db2f7207c65051572436cb,
fixing crashes when guests with 2.6.25 virtio drivers have saturated
virtio network connections.

[https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu-kvm/+bug/458521](https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qemu-kvm/%2Bbug/458521)

That patch should have been whitelisting *_HOST_* rather than the the
*_GUEST_* features.

I tested this by running an Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy guest (2.6.24 kernel +
2.6.25-virtio driver).  I saturated both the incoming, and outgoing
network connection with nc, seeing sustained 6MB/s up and 6MB/s down
bitrates for ~20 minutes.  Previously, this crashed immediately.  Now,
the guest does not crash and maintains network connectivity throughout
the test.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-03-26 13:35:31 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the guest Linux virtio-net driver. Due deficiency in the implementation of the TSO (TCP segment offloading), the guest's virtio-net driver transmitted improper data to the particular QEMU-KVM process on the host, resulting in its termination. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service (guest crash) by sending certain, specially-crafted data to arbitrary open port on the target guest system.  A remote attacker could exploit this to crash guests which use virtio networking on Linux kernels earlier than 2.6.26.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-30 07:51:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0271 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0271.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c7)  Yewei Shao    2010-06-17 14:41:14 UTC  ``` Change the bug to verified according to the [bug 577243#c7](show_bug.cgi?id=577243#c7).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c8)  Yewei Shao    2010-06-17 14:42:14 UTC  ``` Update the [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c7):  Change the bug to verified according to the [bug 577243#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=577243#c4).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=577218#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-22 13:54:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0476 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0476.html>   ``` |  |

RHSA-2010:0476 - Security Advisory

Issued:

2010-06-22
# RHSA-2010:0476 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes two security issues, multiple
bugs, and adds enhancements is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by the
Linux virtio-net driver, used by guest operating systems. Due to a
deficiency in the TSO (TCP segment offloading) implementation, a guest's
virtio-net driver would transmit improper data to a certain QEMU-KVM
process on the host, causing the guest to crash. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send specially-crafted data to a target guest system,
causing that guest to crash. (CVE-2010-0741)

A flaw was found in the way the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)
handled the removal of a virtual machine's (VM) data back end (such as an
image or a volume). When removing an image or a volume, it was not securely
deleted from its corresponding data domain as expected. A guest user in a
new, raw VM, created in a data domain that has had VMs deleted from it,
could use this flaw to read limited data from those deleted VMs,
potentially disclosing sensitive information. (CVE-2010-2223)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for dbus issue
CVE-2009-1189; kernel issues CVE-2010-0307, CVE-2010-0410, CVE-2010-0730,
CVE-2010-1085, and CVE-2010-1086; openldap issue CVE-2009-3767; and sudo
issues CVE-2010-0426, CVE-2010-0427, and CVE-2010-1163.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds several enhancements.
Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available from
<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/2.2/html/Servers-5.5-2.2_Hypervisor_Security_Update>

As Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug
fixes and enhancements from the KVM updates RHSA-2010:0271 and
RHBA-2010:0419 have been included in this update. Also included are the bug
fixes and enhancements from the Virtual Desktop Server Manager (VDSM)
update RHSA-2010:0473, and fence-agents update RHBA-2010:0477.

KVM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0271.html> and
<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0419.html> VDSM: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0473.html> fence-agents: <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2010-0477.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues and adds these
enhancements.
