{
  "CVE-2010-0269": {
    "Root cause": "The Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation improperly allocates memory when parsing specially crafted SMB responses.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory allocation when handling crafted SMB responses."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Most attempts to exploit the vulnerability can lead to system unresponsiveness and restart.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker could host a malicious SMB server and entice a user to connect to it.",
      "A man-in-the-middle attack on a local network could allow an attacker to respond to a legitimate SMB request with a malicious response."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to set up an SMB server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack and convince the victim to initiate an SMB connection to the crafted server."
  }
