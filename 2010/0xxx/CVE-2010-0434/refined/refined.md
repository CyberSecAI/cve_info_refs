Specifically, when subrequests were created, the server would sometimes pass a reference to the parent request's headers_in instead of creating a copy. This allowed modules such as mod_headers to modify the parent request's header table, leading to potential data corruption or information leaks.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The core subrequest processing code had an optimization that avoided copying the parent request's headers for requests without a body, but this allowed subrequests to modify the parent request's data structures, leading to a use-after-free condition if the subrequest's pool was destroyed first.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Exploitation could lead to a daemon crash (segfault) or disclosure of sensitive information. The main request ends up referencing memory it shouldn't be doing, potentially exposing data to the client.\n\nAttack vectors: A remote attacker could trigger the vulnerability by sending a request that causes Apache to create a subrequest, and then use modules like mod_headers to manipulate headers during the subrequest.

It describes a specific bug in the Apache httpd component, specifically regarding a buffer overflow related to setting RequestHeader.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way Apache httpd handles request headers in subrequests when using mod_headers. Specifically, the module was modifying the parent request's headers_in table using the subrequest's pool, which could lead to issues when the subrequest pool was destroyed. This was due to the fact that subrequests were not always provided a copy of the headers_in.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The core apache code was not ensuring that each subrequest had its own copy of headers_in, leading to potential modification of the parent request's data structures. When request headers were modified in a subrequest, if the subrequest's pool was destroyed before parent request processing was complete, the parent request's headers_in table would be corrupted, or potentially cause a crash due to a use-after-free.\n\nImpact of exploitation: This could lead to a daemon crash (segfault) or disclosure of sensitive information.

It shows that this vulnerability was fixed in multiple versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x. \n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: A flaw exists in the core subrequest process code of the Apache HTTP Server. The issue is caused by an optimization where the server reuses the header array of the parent request in subrequests, leading to problems when subrequests modify those headers.
