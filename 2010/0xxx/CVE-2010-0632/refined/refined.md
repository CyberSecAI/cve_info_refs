Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `com_simplefaq` component for Joomla. The `catid` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    * **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly display the results of the SQL injection, making it necessary to use techniques like time-based or boolean-based injections to confirm the success of the injection.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database. This could lead to data theft, modification, or deletion.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests.
    * The specific vulnerable parameter is `catid`.
    * An attacker can craft malicious SQL queries via the `catid` parameter to interact with the database.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application.
    * The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to perform the attack as it's a publicly accessible parameter.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit examples provided demonstrate how to perform a boolean-based blind SQL injection. By crafting queries with `AND` and `substring()` functions against the database version, an attacker can determine if the injected SQL is true or false based on the server response.

Example Exploit URL:
```
www.site.com/index.php?option=com_simplefaq&func=display&Itemid=49&catid=70+and substring(@@version,1,1)=5&page=1#FAQ5
```
This URL attempts to extract the first character of the database version. If the first character is `5`, the query evaluates to `TRUE` and the site may respond differently (although, since it's blind, the difference is not directly shown in the response, so the attacker would have to infer).
