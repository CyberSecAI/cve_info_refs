      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an assertion failure in `TraceRecorder::traverseScopeChain`. This function incorrectly handles scope chain layouts when a function calls eval indirectly to create a closure.",

          "Incorrect scope chain traversal",
          "Assertion failure due to unexpected object layout"

        "attack_vectors": [
          "Specially crafted Javascript using indirect eval to create a closure."
