Attached patch

[Patch for 1.9.2](attachment.cgi?id=427845&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=427845&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=542849&attachment=427845)

A function that calls eval indirectly isn't heavyweight. If that function calls eval to create a closure, and that closure refers to a variable in the function, then traverseScopeChain as it was didn't see the call object, because it only looks for call objects that belong to heavyweights.
In this case, I think we just want to abort, because it's rare, and it isn't obvious that the scope chain will always have the same length.

Indirect eval is global eval now (ES5). Was it in the 1.9.2 Gecko release? I thought so. Cc'ing mrbkap.
If so, no Call objects should be searched, ever. Aborting is fine but if we can stay on trace and do global eval, even better.

It seems not. I tried the shell test case in TM tip, and it does not crash, but says 'm is not defined', as I would expect with indirect eval.

If I change the test to have a global variable 'm', then we do trace it on trunk. So it looks like we're good.

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

I'm not seeing this assertion with the youtube page. I suspect it was triggered by some particular (unusual) text string, perhaps in an ad or some transient listing of videos or comments. It'd be good to have a cut-down test case that reproduces it....

Ah - looks like I can reliably trigger this by loading the Unicode sample page at <http://alanwood.net/unicode/unicode_samples.html>. Should be able to narrow it down from there.
(That page triggers several other assertions too....)

[testcase, generates 4 assertions with current trunk build](attachment.cgi?id=420323)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=420323&action=edit)

The assertion can be triggered by the presence of particular Unicode characters. This testcase has 4 characters (U+FEFF, FFF9, FFFA, FFFB) that each trigger it.
I'm guessing the occurrence on youtube was probably temporary, caused by a character present in some dynamic content at that time.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=420347&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=538065&attachment=420347)

The problem arises when SanitizeGlyphRuns deletes the last glyph run from the array, but fails to update the "last" variable; then on the next iteration it would try to look at the no-longer-valid "last" element of the array. Simple fix is to decrement "last" when deleting an array element.
This patch does that, and the assertions no longer occur. I've also renamed "last" to "lastRunIndex" just because I think it's clearer.
Incidentally, the problem only occurred with the Core Text backend, not ATSUI, because they generate different glyph arrays in the case of invisible characters such as those in the testcase here: Core Text deletes them (resulting in empty glyph runs, which SanitizeGlyphRuns is designed to eliminate), whereas ATSUI leaves a "deleted" placeholder glyph in the glyph array.Assignee: nobody → jfkthame

I think we should take this on 1.9.2 as well, as soon as it's landed on trunk. The chance of the bug actually being exploitable seems pretty slim, IMO, but I see no reason NOT to fix it; it's clear what the error is, and the patch is simple and safe.Flags: blocking1.9.2?

Hmm, does my patch in [bug 533393](/show_bug.cgi?id=533393 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - \"ASSERTION: invalid array index\" in gfxTextRun::SanitizeGlyphRuns with U+2061") fix this? I forgot to land it :-(

If this isn't a hard release blocker, which I don't think it is as per [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=538065#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: invalid array index\" with glyphruns at YouTube"), then I don't think it would cause a RC respin on its own. If we have to do a new RC we'll take it as a ridealong, otherwise, 3.6.1.Flags: blocking1.9.2? → blocking1.9.2-Whiteboard: [3.6.x][rc-ridealong]

Right - sorry, I didn't mean to suggest this needs to affect RC now, it's clearly not critical. Just that we should take it on the branch when we have the opportunity. Blocking was the wrong flag to request; how about approval1.9.2.1 on the patch?

Does this affect the 1.9.1 branch? It doesn't have the regression keyword so it might, and we don't want to land in a 3.6.x security update and not the corresponding 3.5.x security update if it affects both.

No, it doesn't affect 1.9.1 because this bug is in code that was added specifically as part of the CoreText support, and we don't have CoreText support in 1.9.1 / 3.5.x.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-11

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.2.2/ 1.9.1.8/ 1.9.0.18)

Announced
March 23, 2010
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.18
* Firefox 3.5.8
* Firefox 3.6.2
* SeaMonkey 2.0.3
* Thunderbird 3.0.2

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in
the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References
