- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incomplete logging of chat messages, as the server only logs certain message types, allowing some messages to go unrecorded.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote user could send messages through the server without them being logged, potentially obscuring communication for audit or record-keeping purposes.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specific types of chat messages through the iChat server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote user able to send chat messages through the affected iChat server.
