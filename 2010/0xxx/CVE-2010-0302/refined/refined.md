  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the cupsd daemon related to how it handles file descriptors with epoll and kqueue implementations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Improper reference counting"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause an unexpected application termination of the cupsd daemon, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Issuing a maliciously crafted get-printer-jobs request"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a specific crafted network request to the CUPS server.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-3553. The original fix did not properly handle the kqueue and epoll implementations. The vulnerability exists because the file descriptors that are being used for epoll/kqueue are not immediately dereferenced, instead, they are added to a separate list, and the write_cb function will still be called which may lead to a use-after-free condition. The correct fix is to check if the file descriptor is in the inactive list before calling the write_cb function."
