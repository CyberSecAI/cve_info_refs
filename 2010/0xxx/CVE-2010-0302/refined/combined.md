How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Description: SquirrelMail is updated to version 1.4.20 to address several vulnerabilities, the most serious of which is a cross-site scripting issue. Further information is available via the SquirrelMail web site at [http://www.SquirrelMail.org/](http://www.squirrelmail.org/)

* **Wiki Server**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1382

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.3, Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.3

  Impact: Viewing maliciously crafted Wiki content may result in a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: The Wiki Server does not specify an explicit character set when serving HTML documents in response to user requests. An attacker with the ability to post or comment on Wiki Server hosted content may include scripts encoded in an alternate character set. This may lead to a cross-site scripting attack against users of the Wiki Server. The issue is addressed by specifying a character set for the document in HTTP responses.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c0)  Tim Waugh    2010-01-22 15:00:09 UTC  ``` Description of problem: [CVE-2009-3553](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3553) ([bug #530111](show_bug.cgi?id=530111 "ASSIGNED - CVE-2009-3553 cups: Use-after-free (crash) due improper reference counting in abstract file descriptors handling interface")) has not been completely fixed.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Versions known to be affected:  cups-1.3.7-11.el5_4.5 (RHEL-5.4.z) cups-1.3.7-16.el5     (RHEL-5)  Additional info: The cause is that the cupsdDoSelect() function uses one of several implementations depending on the underlying select/poll capabilities of the operating system.  For kqueue and epoll implementations, cupsdRemoveSelect() does not immediately decrease the reference count for the file descriptor and instead adds it to the cupsd_inactive_fds array.  File descriptors in that array are finally dereferenced in cupsdStopSelect() (i.e. program termination).  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the epoll implementation is used.  The previous fix for [CVE-2009-3553](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3553) was to check that another reference was held for the file descriptor before calling the write_cb function; however, that will always be the case for both the epoll and kqueue implementations.  The correct fix is to check whether the file descriptor is in the cupsd_inactive_fds array before calling the write_cb function.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c1)  Tim Waugh    2010-01-22 15:02:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 386167](attachment.cgi?id=386167&action=diff "cups-CVE-2009-3553-incomplete-fix.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=386167&action=edit "cups-CVE-2009-3553-incomplete-fix.patch") cups-CVE-2009-3553-incomplete-fix.patch  Attached is a patch for RHEL-5.4.z.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c2)  Tim Waugh    2010-01-22 15:33:07 UTC  ``` Small correction: file descriptions in the cupsd_inactive_fds array are finally dereferenced just before cupsdDoSelect() returns.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-27 04:40:51 UTC  ``` Hi Tim.  Was this incorrect fix provided by upstream, or did we come up with the fix and neglect to deal with the kqueue and epoll implementations?  In other words, is this a Red Hat-only issue, or do we need to alert other vendors and is upstream aware of the incomplete fix?  We'll need to get a new CVE name for this, regardless.  Thanks for the clarification.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c4)  Tim Waugh    2010-01-27 09:28:46 UTC  ``` It was my original patch (sorry), but Michael Sweet also missed the problem and committed it upstream for the not-yet-released 1.4.3 version.  We did alert other vendors about [CVE-2009-3553](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3553) originally, and my patch was proposed.  Michael Sweet replied on that thread saying that was the patch that would be used to fix it, so very likely other vendors are using it as-is.  Upstream is not yet aware of the incomplete fix.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c5)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-28 18:45:27 UTC  ``` I've assigned [CVE-2010-0302](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0302) for this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c6)  Josh Bressers    2010-02-02 20:05:40 UTC  ``` Tim,  Can anyone been told of this yet? I'm not sure how upstream likes to handle security flaws. Some guidance would be appreciated.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c7)  Tim Waugh    2010-02-03 11:21:12 UTC  ``` I'm not sure what the protocol is myself.  I didn't want to tell anyone without the say-so of the SRT...  If you're happy for me to report it upstream I can do that? (There is a mechanism for reporting private security bugs on cups.org.)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c8)  Josh Bressers    2010-02-03 14:55:08 UTC  ``` Let's start with upstream, once we have a final patch we can tell the vendors.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c9)  Tim Waugh    2010-02-03 16:09:32 UTC  ``` Reported upstream.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c22)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-03 17:31:14 UTC  ``` The embargo has lifted.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-03 17:40:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0129 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0129.html>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c24)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-05 11:08:07 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.2-26.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.2-26.fc11>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c25)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-05 11:30:14 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.2-28.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.2-28.fc12>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c26)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-05 11:39:05 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.2-34.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.4.2-34.fc13>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c27)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-11 13:24:33 UTC  ``` cups-1.4.2-34.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.

# USN-906-1: CUPS vulnerabilities

3 March 2010

CUPS vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [cups](/security/cves?package=cups) -
* [cupsys](/security/cves?package=cupsys) -

## Details

It was discovered that the CUPS scheduler did not properly handle certain

network operations. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw and cause the

CUPS server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 8.10, 9.04 and 9.10. ([CVE-2009-3553](/security/CVE-2009-3553),

[CVE-2010-0302](/security/CVE-2010-0302))

Ronald Volgers discovered that the CUPS lppasswd tool could be made to load

localized message strings from arbitrary files by setting an environment

variable. A local attacker could exploit this with a format-string

vulnerability leading to a root privilege escalation. The default compiler

options for Ubuntu 8.10, 9.04 and 9.10 should reduce this vulnerability to

a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-0393](/security/CVE-2010-0393))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c0)  Tim Waugh    2010-01-22 15:00:09 UTC  ``` Description of problem: [CVE-2009-3553](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3553) ([bug #530111](show_bug.cgi?id=530111 "ASSIGNED - CVE-2009-3553 cups: Use-after-free (crash) due improper reference counting in abstract file descriptors handling interface")) has not been completely fixed.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Versions known to be affected:  cups-1.3.7-11.el5_4.5 (RHEL-5.4.z) cups-1.3.7-16.el5     (RHEL-5)  Additional info: The cause is that the cupsdDoSelect() function uses one of several implementations depending on the underlying select/poll capabilities of the operating system.  For kqueue and epoll implementations, cupsdRemoveSelect() does not immediately decrease the reference count for the file descriptor and instead adds it to the cupsd_inactive_fds array.  File descriptors in that array are finally dereferenced in cupsdStopSelect() (i.e. program termination).  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the epoll implementation is used.  The previous fix for [CVE-2009-3553](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3553) was to check that another reference was held for the file descriptor before calling the write_cb function; however, that will always be the case for both the epoll and kqueue implementations.  The correct fix is to check whether the file descriptor is in the cupsd_inactive_fds array before calling the write_cb function.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c1)  Tim Waugh    2010-01-22 15:02:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 386167](attachment.cgi?id=386167&action=diff "cups-CVE-2009-3553-incomplete-fix.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=386167&action=edit "cups-CVE-2009-3553-incomplete-fix.patch") cups-CVE-2009-3553-incomplete-fix.patch  Attached is a patch for RHEL-5.4.z.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c2)  Tim Waugh    2010-01-22 15:33:07 UTC  ``` Small correction: file descriptions in the cupsd_inactive_fds array are finally dereferenced just before cupsdDoSelect() returns.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-27 04:40:51 UTC  ``` Hi Tim.  Was this incorrect fix provided by upstream, or did we come up with the fix and neglect to deal with the kqueue and epoll implementations?  In other words, is this a Red Hat-only issue, or do we need to alert other vendors and is upstream aware of the incomplete fix?  We'll need to get a new CVE name for this, regardless.  Thanks for the clarification.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c4)  Tim Waugh    2010-01-27 09:28:46 UTC  ``` It was my original patch (sorry), but Michael Sweet also missed the problem and committed it upstream for the not-yet-released 1.4.3 version.  We did alert other vendors about [CVE-2009-3553](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3553) originally, and my patch was proposed.  Michael Sweet replied on that thread saying that was the patch that would be used to fix it, so very likely other vendors are using it as-is.  Upstream is not yet aware of the incomplete fix.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c5)  Josh Bressers    2010-01-28 18:45:27 UTC  ``` I've assigned [CVE-2010-0302](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0302) for this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c6)  Josh Bressers    2010-02-02 20:05:40 UTC  ``` Tim,  Can anyone been told of this yet? I'm not sure how upstream likes to handle security flaws. Some guidance would be appreciated.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=557775#c7)  Tim Waugh    2010-02-03 11:21:12 UTC  ``` I'm not sure what the protocol is myself.  I didn't want to tell anyone without the say-so of the SRT...  If you're happy for me to report it upstream I can do that?

# RHSA-2010:0129 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: cups security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0129)

## Topic

Updated cups packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer
for UNIX operating systems.

It was discovered that the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2009:1595 did not
fully correct the use-after-free flaw in the way CUPS handled references in
its file descriptors-handling interface. A remote attacker could send
specially-crafted queries to the CUPS server, causing it to crash.
(CVE-2010-0302)

Users of cups are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
update, the cupsd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

# CUPS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201207-10**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in CUPS, some of which may
allow execution of arbitrary code or local privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-print/cups** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.8-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.8-r1** |

### Background

CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System, is a full-featured print server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in CUPS. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code using specially
crafted streams, IPP requests or files, or cause a Denial of Service
(daemon crash or hang). A local attacker may be able to gain escalated
privileges or overwrite arbitrary files. Furthermore, a remote attacker
may be able to obtain sensitive information from the CUPS process or
hijack a CUPS administrator authentication request.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.4.8-r1"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since September 03, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
