The provided content describes multiple instances of the same vulnerability affecting the `qoslist` command in IBM AIX 6.1, each with a different APAR (Authorized Program Analysis Report) number. All instances share a similar root cause and impact.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `qoslist` command crashes due to a buffer overflow when a very long string argument is passed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: The program fails to properly handle a long string argument, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The `qoslist` command aborts with a segmentation fault (core dump). This can lead to service disruptions if the command is essential for system operation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Passing a long string argument to the `qoslist` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `qoslist` command on the affected system and provide long string arguments.
- No special privileges are mentioned in the provided descriptions.

**Affected Versions:**
- AIX 6.1.0.1 (IZ71869)
- AIX 6.1.0.2 (IZ71590)
- AIX 6.1.0.3 (IZ71554)
- AIX 6.1.0.4 (IZ68194)

**Fixes:**
Each APAR has a corresponding fix. They are:
- IZ71869 : U831295
- IZ71590 : U831082
- IZ71554 : U831222
- IZ68194 : U830440

**Additional Notes:**
- The fixes resolve buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
- All APARs are sysrouted from IZ66917, implying a related or parent issue.
- The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description, specifying the affected command and the exact cause of the vulnerability.
