How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=559681#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-28 18:26:19 UTC  ``` Christoph Anton Mitterer reported [1] that maildrop is prone to a privilege escalation issue that grants a user root group privileges.  This is due to maildrop not dropping supplementary groups when being invoked by root.  Simple testcase is to create a testmaildrop user and then create ~testmaildrop/.mailfilter (owned by testmaildrop and mode 0600):  % sudo cat ~testmaildrop/.mailfilter echo `id` exit % sudo maildrop -V2 -d testmaildrop </dev/null maildrop: Changing to /tmp/testmaildrop Message start at 0 bytes, envelope sender=testmaildrop maildrop: Attempting .mailfilter maildrop: Filtering through `id` uid=13910(testmaildrop) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023  Note that debian has maildrop only sgid mail, but Fedora provides maildrop suid root and sgid mail.  Also note that this cannot be used to quickly elevate your own privileges and this can only be taken advantage of if maildrop is actually executed by root (even with it being suid root):  % sudo su - testmaildrop $ maildrop -V2 -d testmaildrop </dev/null maildrop: Changing to /tmp/testmaildrop Message start at 0 bytes, envelope sender=testmaildrop maildrop: Attempting .mailfilter maildrop: Filtering through `id` uid=13910(testmaildrop) gid=13910(testmaildrop) groups=13910(testmaildrop) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 $ ls -al `which maildrop` -rwsr-sr-x. 1 root mail 175944 2009-09-04 15:49 /usr/bin/maildrop  The Debian bug report notes this patch will fix the issue:  diff -U3 -r1.58 main.C --- maildrop/main.C 13 Jan 2010 01:32:02 -0000  1.58 +++ maildrop/main.C 15 Jan 2010 03:49:01 -0000 @@ -476,6 +476,8 @@                     nouser(); #if RESET_GID                 setgroupid(my_pw->pw_gid); +#else +               setgroupid(getegid()); #endif                 setuid(my_pw->pw_uid);                 if (getuid() != my_pw->pw_uid)  Note that debian has maildrop only sgid mail, but Fedora provides maildrop suid root and sgid mail.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1981-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Steffen Joeris

Package        : maildrop
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : No CVE id yet
Debian Bug     : 564601

Christoph Anton Mitterer discovered that maildrop, a mail delivery agent
with filtering abilities, is prone to a privilege escalation issue that
grants a user root group privileges.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-3+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.2-11+etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your maildrop packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Can you sum this up in a few sentences? I'm having a horrible time

Subject: possible problems when switching UID/GIDs in delivery mode when
run as root
Date: Sun, 10 Jan 2010 17:06:56 +0100
```
Package: maildrop
Justification: user security hole
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Hi.

Not sure if this actually a hole or if I just misunderstand
something,... but:

In debian /usr/bin/maildrop ist installed:
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root mail 163k Nov  9 01:11 /usr/bin/maildrop

So I'd expect that the following invocation (as root!!):
# maildrop -d vmail
results in something like the following contents of /tmp/foo:
uid=115(vmail) gid=119(vmail) groups=119(vmail),119(vmail)
when ~vmail/.mailfilter is:
`id`

Right so far?
It does however result in:
uid=115(vmail) gid=0(root) groups=119(vmail),0(root)
which can be quite security critical as it now has root-group
privileges.

Cheers,
Chris.

Hmm. It shouldn't have anything to do with the setgid bit, because it's
setgid to the mail group, not the root group.

I think we've had a bug report related to the supplementary groups once
before, maybe the patch somehow got lost, I'll need to check the history.

This depends on the maildrop configuration, but generally setgroupid won't
have any effect if maildrop is invoked as root, since maildrop will use the
userid specified by the -d option to set its running group and userid
anyway.

Uhm... what does this mean? It definitely has root-group permissions....
(at least the Debian version) ;)

If maildrop runs as root, maildrop can set its userid and groupid, maildrop
drops root according to the userid and groupid that's specified by the -d
option. The group id that maildrop gets invoked as, is irrelevant as long as
the userid is root. The root uid is sufficient for any process to change its
gid and uid. So, when maildrop is invoked by root, its group id, whether
natural or if set by the setgroupid bit, has no effect.

I think we all agree on that. What Christoph has found, and I have
reproduced, is that it doesn't exactly turn out properly.

Can you verify? Add a simple test user, put `id` in its .mailfilter, and
see what output you get. This is with version 2.2.0.

Just to make sure - because I can't tell from this output - does this test
include root running "maildrop -d mail"?

OK, but this is different behaviour from what the bug report is about?

This is what I mean:

% sudo useradd -m -d /tmp/testmaildrop testmaildrop
% id testmaildrop
uid=1006(testmaildrop) gid=1006(testmaildrop) groups=1006(testmaildrop)
% sudo -u testmaildrop sh -c "echo echo \\\`id\\\` >> ~testmaildrop/.mailfilter"
% sudo -u testmaildrop sh -c "echo exit >> ~testmaildrop/.mailfilter"
% sudo maildrop -V2 -d testmaildrop < /dev/null
ERR: authdaemon: s_connect() failed: No such file or directory
maildrop: Changing to /tmp/testmaildrop
Message start at 0 bytes, envelope sender=testmaildrop
maildrop: Attempting .mailfilter
maildrop: Filtering through `id`
uid=1006(testmaildrop) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

That's the problem. After using -d, it changes the user but not the group.
Can you reproduce that?

                               my_pw=getpwnam(deliverymode);
                               if (!my_pw)
                                       nouser();
#if     RESET_GID
                               setgroupid(my_pw→pw_gid);
#endif
                               setuid(my_pw→pw_uid);

This conditional compilation flag is set up in configure.in:

if test "`ls -ld $TDIR/. | cut -c10`" = "t"
then
       MBOX_RESET_GID=1
else
       MBOX_RESET_GID=0
fi

TDIR is /var/spool/mail. Basically, the process's group ID gets set only if
configure finds that its sticky bit is set.

Some historical unix platforms had the sticky bit set on /var/spool/mail,
and users' mailboxes are owned fully by the users' uid and gid. So
/var/spool/mail has the same permission-wise semantics as /tmp.

But on modern platforms, /var/spool/mail does not have its sticky bit set.
The directory is owned by group mail, writeable by the mail group, and each
mailbox in /var/spool/mail is owned by the userid, and groupid mail. In this
environment, for maildrop to be able to create a mailbox in /var/spool/mail,
it must be run as group mail. maildrop's binary gets installed as userid
root, group mail, setuserid and setgroupid bits set.

So, invoking maildrop gives it root privileges, and groupid mail. maildrop
checks the -d option, changes its userid as specified, leaves the group id
at its acquired "mail" uid, then it can create stuff in /var/spool/mail
appropriately.

That's what it looks like is happening here, to me. The missing link in your
situation, apparently, is maildrop binary's setgroupid bit being set.

Note, that there's extensive discussion of this in maildrop's INSTALL.
Search for "RESET_GID" in INSTALL. The only thing I see in INSTALL that
might need correcting is the reference to RESET_GID's default value always
being 1; that's not true.

We use this by default:

% ls -l =maildrop
-rwxr-sr-x 1 root mail 162676 2008-01-20 23:23 /usr/bin/maildrop

I think we're suffering from the fact that the +s bit sets the effective
gid, but that gets ignored later. I'm not sure, but it sounds like we may
need an explicit setgid or something, to make sure we really honor the
+s bit rather than root's real gid?

% cat gid.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(void) {

  gid_t mygid;

  mygid = getgid();
  printf("getgid returned: %d\n", mygid);
  mygid = getegid();
  printf("getegid returned: %d\n", mygid);

  setgid(getegid());

  mygid = getgid();
  printf("getgid returned: %d\n", mygid);
  mygid = getegid();
  printf("getegid returned: %d\n", mygid);

}
% gcc -o gid gid.c
% sudo chgrp mail ./gid; sudo chmod g+s ./gid
% ./gid
getgid returned: 1000
getegid returned: 8
getgid returned: 1000
getegid returned: 8
% sudo ./gid
getgid returned: 0
getegid returned: 8
getgid returned: 8
getegid returned: 8

Maybe, maybe not. Instead of invoking 'id' as a child process of maildrop,
try just having maildrop deliver a test message to a new mailbox, and see
what the ownership of the new file becomes.

There's some juggling of userid and groupid that happens as a result of
exec(), so exec()in 'id' may itself be changing the picture. The man page
for exec(2) says:

      The effective user ID of the process is copied to the  saved  set-user-
      ID; similarly, the effective group ID is copied to the saved set-group-
      ID.  This copying takes place after any effective ID changes that occur
      because of the set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits.

That does not paint 100% of the picture, but I have a dim recollection of
having to deal with this, in a different context, elsewhere. Try the
experiment I suggested, and see what happens.

That part is fine, it sets the group to mail on newly-created mailboxes.

But at the same time this maildrop is able to deliver mails to existing
files whose group is set to "root" and are group-writable. I created an
empty file owned by root:root mode 660 and 'maildrop -d testmaildrop'
successfully wrote to it. That side-effect is not supposed to happen.

Let's try the following patch. I do appreciate your help in testing it. It's
not easy for me to test all possible permutations of distro-specific
configurations, and platform-specific nuances, that float around.

Sadly there's no change in behaviour of the test case. I'll try fiddling
with it some more.

OK, it works when I put it in the first block, where it first does setuid()
because of the delivery mode. Then the subprocess gets the group mail.

OK. Do we envision any other side-effects that might in turn arise from
this change? I don't know much about the Courier-integrated use cases.

Don't think so. The Courier version has RESET_GID always set, this has no
impact on the Courier version of mailrop. For the standalone maildrop
version, this is a fairly limited change, only effective when the default
mailbox directory does not have the sticky bit set. The net effect is fairly
well understood.
