Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-0795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `event_id` parameter of the JE Event Calendar component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`event_id`), allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This can lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** Extracting sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    - **Denial of Service:** Disrupting the application's normal operation.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application or the server by modifying administrative accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via specially crafted HTTP GET requests targeting the vulnerable parameter `event_id` in the component's URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to send HTTP requests and craft SQL injection payloads.
- **No Prior Authentication:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication or access to administrative privileges.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `event_id`.
- The vulnerable URL pattern is:
  `http://server/index.php?template=system&option=com_jeeventcalendar&view=event&Itemid=155&event_id=[SQL]`
- A sample exploit URL is provided:
   `http://server/index.php?template=system&option=com_jeeventcalendar&view=event&Itemid=155&event_id=-1%22+UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,@@version,database(),username,password,6,7,8+FROM+jos_users%23`
   This example demonstrates extracting the database version, name, usernames, and passwords.
