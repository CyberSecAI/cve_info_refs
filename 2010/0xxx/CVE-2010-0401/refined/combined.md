How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

It is possible to circumvent the server password of a network game. It is
possible in two cases:
1.you know the company password of one of the companies
1.one of the companies has no password

In both cases you send the company password (or “” if there is none) when you
receive the request for the server’s password.

This fix also prevents reading invalid data and possibly crashing a server when
a spectator sends a company password packet. Even though this is technically
a different vulnerability, the fix for the access restriction circumvention fixes
the other vulnerability too as it will never request and thus accept company
password packets from spectators.

Note that this is a custom fix for backports as a more elobarate fix with a
different network protocol was used for 1.0.1 and trunk (r19607). However,
we cannot break the network protocol for older versions thus this version is
needed.
This version does not change the network protocol, except for a
misbehaving client that sends the company password if the server password is
expected. In this case the client is disconnected citing a protocol error.
