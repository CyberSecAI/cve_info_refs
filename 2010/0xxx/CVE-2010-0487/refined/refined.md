Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding **CVE-2010-0487**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Windows Cabinet File Viewer (cabview.dll) omitting fields from the file digest during the signing and verification of a cabinet (.cab) file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of cabinet file signatures. The Cabinet File Viewer does not properly verify all fields of a file digest when verifying the signature of a cabinet file, which allows for a crafted malicious file to be seen as valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution. This means the attacker could:
    - Take complete control of the affected system.
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker modifies an existing signed cabinet file to point unverified portions of the signature to malicious code.
- The attacker then convinces a user to open or view the specially crafted cabinet file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to modify signed .cab files.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted .cab file, which could be achieved through social engineering or other means of delivering the file to the user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the way the Cabinet File Viewer handles and verifies signatures in .cab files.
- This issue is addressed with a security update that enforces the processing of all fields from the file digest when signing and verifying cabinet files.
- The bulletin also notes that the vulnerability affects all versions of Windows listed.
- This vulnerability was not publicly known and was reported to Microsoft through responsible disclosure.
- At the time of the security bulletin release, there was no indication of it being used in attacks.
