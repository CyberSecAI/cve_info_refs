  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the Windows TCP/IP stack does not properly check the source IPv6 address in a tunneled ISATAP packet.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of the IPv6 source address within tunneled ISATAP packets, allowing for spoofing."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could spoof an IPv4 address, potentially bypassing filtering devices that rely on source IPv4 addresses. Information could also be disclosed when the targeted computer replies to the message using the attacker-specified source IPv6 address.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting network packets with a spoofed IPv6 source address in an ISATAP connection, where the IPv6 source address does not correspond to the actual IPv4 source address.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a target system that has ISATAP interface configured."
