# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-029 - Moderate

## Vulnerability in Windows ISATAP Component Could Allow Spoofing (978338)

Published: April 13, 2010 | Updated: April 21, 2010

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. This security update is rated Moderate for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not vulnerable because these operating systems include the feature deployed by this security update. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to spoof an IPv4 address so that it may bypass filtering devices that rely on the source IPv4 address. The security update addresses the vulnerability by changing the manner in which the Windows TCP/IP stack checks the source IPv6 address in a tunneled ISATAP packet. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

* **Potential Router List (PRL) on ISATAP clients:** PRL enables clients to do source address checking for incoming ISATAP tunneled packets. PRL is enabled by default upon installing this security update and helps address the ISATAP IPv6 Source Address Spoofing Vulnerability described in CVE-2010-0812. More information on PRL can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 978338](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/978338).
* **Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) on ISATAP interfaces:** NUD is used to validate whether a neighbor is reachable or not. NUD is performed by the ISATAP nodes before sending ISATAP packets. NUD is not enabled by default and needs to be manually configured by network administrators. More information on NUD and how to enable it can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 978338](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/978338).

**Why is Microsoft Windows 2000 not affected by this vulnerability?**

Microsoft Windows 2000 does not include support for IPv6 and therefore, this operating system is not vulnerable.

**Why are Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 not affected by this vulnerability?**

The features deployed by this security update, Potential Router List (PRL) and Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD), are already present in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.

**Note** While PRL is enabled by default on these platforms, NUD is not, and must be manually configured by the network administrator. Please review [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 978338](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/978338) for additional information on this feature.

**Will this update be offered even if I do not have IPv6 enabled?**

Yes, this security update will be offered through Automatic Updates because the vulnerable code exists on these systems. We recommend that customers install the security update if they plan to deploy IPv6 in the future.

## ISATAP IPv6 Source Address Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0812

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Windows IPv6 stack due to the way that Windows checks the inner packet's IPv6 source address in a tunneled ISATAP packet. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could impersonate an address to bypass edge or host firewalls. Additionally, information could be disclosed when the targeted computer replies to the message using the source IPv6 address that the attacker specified.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0812](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0812).

#### Mitigating Factors for ISATAP IPv6 Source Address Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0812

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability only impacts Windows systems with the ISATAP interface configured.

#### Workarounds for ISATAP IPv6 Source Address Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0812

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block IP Protocol Type 41 (ISATAP) at the firewall**

  The ISATAP protocol is defined as protocol type 41 by [RFC4214: Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4214.txt). Blocking this protocol type at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports or protocols.
* **Disable the ISATAP IPv6 interface**

  To disable the ISATAP IPv6 interface, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  `netsh interface isatap set state disabled`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to complete this workaround.

  **Impact of workaround.** Disabling the ISATAP interface will prevent the system from using ISATAP as an IPv6 tunneling mechanism.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the ISATAP IPv6 interface, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:

  `netsh interface isatap set state enabled`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to undo this workaround.

#### FAQ for ISATAP IPv6 Source Address Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0812

| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## More Information

### Description of the functionality changes in this security bulletin

This security update implements two features on IPv6 Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP):

* Potential Router List (PRL): PRL enables ISATAP clients to perform source address checking on incoming ISATAP packets. PRL is documented in Internet Standard RFC 5214. After you install this security update, additional enforcement will occur based on the information in the PRL. This helps protect customers against the vulnerability that is described in security bulletin MS10-029.
* Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD): NUD is used by ISATAP routers to check whether a neighbor is reachable or not. NUD is documented in Internet standard RFC 4861. Because of high compatibility requirements, NUD is turned off by default after you install this security update. Therefore, NUD requires manual configuration.

#### How does the Potential Router List (PRL) work?

The Potential Router List is a feature that maintains a list on each ISATAP client of its ISATAP routers. These addresses are obtained from DNS resolution on the ISATAP router. After you install this update, Windows will perform additional validation by using the information that is contained in the PRL.

When a packet is received, the packet will be processed only if one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

* The IPv4 source address matches the last 32 bits of the IPv6 source address.
* The IPv4 source address matches an address in the Potential Router List. This indicates that the packet was tunneled by the client’s ISATAP router.

For example, consider the following scenario:

| Host | IPv4 address | IPv6 address |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 1.1.1.1 | 3ffe::5efe:1.1.1.1 |
| B | 2.2.2.2 | 2ffe::5efe:2.2.2.2 |

In this scenario, host A sends an ISATAP tunneled packet to host B with the IPv4 source address of 1.1.1.1. A spoofed IPv6 source address exists in the tunneled packet, for example, 2ffe::5efe:3.3.3.3. Without PRL, host B would respond to 3.3.3.3 instead of 1.1.1.1.

However, when PRL is used, PRL detects the spoofing attempt and will not process the packet.

#### How does Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) work?

Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) is a new feature that is deployed by this update on ISATAP routers. NUD will validate whether a neighbor is reachable or not before forwarding packets. This helps ensure correct operations of the network and prevents specific kinds of routing loops.

Before forwarding a packet, upon enabling this feature, the router will send a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) to the destination ISATAP node. This node will receive the solicitation, and if it does not have the IPv6 address in question, the ISATAP node will not respond to the NS and will discard the packet. If the address is assigned to the receiving ISATAP node, the ISATAP node will respond with a Neighbor Advertisement (NA). Upon receiving this NA, the originating node will forward the packet.

#### How should I deploy NUD in my network?

Customers should be careful when they deploy NUD. If not all ISATAP nodes on the network support NUD, enabling NUD could result in connectivity issues. An ISATAP router that sends a Neighbor Solicitation to a device that does not support NUD will not receive a reply. Therefore the ISATAP router would conclude that the route is unavailable.

NUD is supported in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2-based systems. However, it must be manually enabled.

In Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008-based systems, you must install security update 978338 and then manually enable NUD.

We recommend that you verify with any third-party suppliers of ISATAP-enabled routers to determine whether their device implements NUD, and supports processing of NS and NA packets.

#### How do I enable Neighbor Unreachability Detection?

##### Enable NUD on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2-based systems

To enable Neighbor Unreachability Detection, follow these steps:

1. Type the following command at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   netsh int ipv6 set interface **ISATAP interface-name** nud=enabled
2. Restart the computer.

To disable Neighbor Unreachability Detection, follow these steps:

1. Type the following command at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   netsh int ipv6 set interface **ISATAP interface-name** nud=di store=persistent
2. Restart the computer.

##### Enable NUD on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003-based systems

### Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 file information

* The files that apply to a specific product, milestone (RTM, SP**n**), and service branch (LDR, GDR) can be identified by examining the file version numbers as shown in the following table:

  | Version | Product | Milestone | Service branch |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 6.0.6000.16**xxx** | Windows Vista | RTM | GDR |
  | 6.0.6000.20**xxx** | Windows Vista | RTM | LDR |
  | 6.0.6001.18**xxx** | Windows Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008 SP1 | SP1 | GDR |
  | 6.0.6001.22**xxx** | Windows Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008 SP1 | SP1 | LDR |
  | 6.0.6002.18**xxx** | Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 SP2 | SP2 | GDR |
  | 6.0.6002.22**xxx** | Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 SP2 | SP2 | LDR |
* Service Pack 1 is integrated into the release version of Windows Server 2008. Therefore, RTM milestone files apply only to Windows Vista. RTM milestone files have a 6.0.0000.**xxxxxx** version number.
* GDR service branches contain only those fixes that are widely released to address widespread, critical issues. LDR service branches contain hotfixes in addition to widely released fixes.
* The MANIFEST files (.manifest) and the MUM files (.mum) that are installed for each environment are [listed separately](#bkmk_manifests). MUM and MANIFEST files, and the associated security catalog (.cat) files, are critical to maintaining the state of the updated component. The security catalog files (attributes not listed) are signed with a Microsoft digital signature.
