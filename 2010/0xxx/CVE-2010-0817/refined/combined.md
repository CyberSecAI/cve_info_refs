**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2028554](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028554) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**What is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0?**

Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 provides a platform for collaborative applications, offering a common framework for document management and a common repository for storing documents of all types. It exposes key Windows Server services like Windows Workflow Services and Windows Rights Management Services.

Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 is provided as a free download for supported editions of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.

**How is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 related to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007?**

Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is an integrated suite of server capabilities built on top of Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.

**In what configurations will I need to apply the different updates?**

You will need to apply one or both updates, depending on which SharePoint product is installed on your system. For systems with only Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 installed, you will need to apply the KB983444 update. For systems with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 installed, you will need to apply both the KB979445 and KB983444 updates. There is no configuration where you can only have Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and not Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.

**I use the 2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 1. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for the 2007 Microsoft Office System, when users of Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 2. All updates released after April 24, 2009 for Microsoft Office 2007 will include these security features, which were introduced in the [2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=b444bf18-79ea-46c6-8a81-9db49b4ab6e5&displaylang;=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems.

**The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system was delivered with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in their version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle.

## Help.aspx XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0817

A cross-site scripting and spoofing vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 that could allow an attacker to convince a user to run a malicious script. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could modify Web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches. Additionally, an attacker could put spoofed content into those caches. An attacker may also be able to exploit the vulnerability to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0817](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0817).

#### Mitigating Factors for Help.aspx XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0817

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Internet Explorer 8 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The Internet Explorer 8 XSS Filter, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
* An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to be run by the user clicking the specially crafted URL, but the attacker would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click on a URL that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for Help.aspx XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0817

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict Access to SharePoint Help.aspx**

  An administrator can apply an access control list to SharePoint Help.aspx to ensure that they can no longer be loaded. This effectively prevents exploitation of the vulnerability using this attack vector.

  To restrict access to the vulnerable Help.aspx, run the following commands from a command prompt:

  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx" /E /P everyone:N

  ```
  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx" /E /P everyone:N

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** This workaround will disable all help functionality from the SharePoint server.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Run the following commands from a command prompt:

  ```
  takeown /f "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx"

  ```
  ```
  takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx"

  ```
  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx" /E /R everyone

  ```
  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx" /E /R everyone

  ```

#### FAQ for Help.aspx XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0817

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a scripting vulnerability that could result in elevation of privilege in Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 that could allow an attacker to convince a user to run a malicious script. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks, display spoofed responses to users, or redirect server responses to another user. It may also be possible for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to modify Web browser caches and intermediate proxy server caches and to put spoofed content in those caches.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 do not properly validate input that is provided to an HTML query before sending this input to the browser.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights on the SharePoint site as the targeted user. The attacker could then run commands against the SharePoint server in the context of the targeted user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In order for an attack to be successful, a user would have to click on an attacker provided, specially crafted link to an affected server.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message containing the specially crafted link to the user of the targeted affected server and by convincing the user to click on the specially crafted link.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted link to the targeted affected server that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to click on the specially crafted link.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Client systems where users browse the Internet are primarily at risk.

**What is the Internet Explorer 8 Cross Site-scripting (XSS) Filter?**

Cross-site scripting attacks try to exploit vulnerabilities in the Web sites you use. The vulnerability described in this bulletin is an example. In this case, you might receive an e-mail message that contains a specially crafted Web site address that includes a script. When you click on the URL, you are directed to a legitimate SharePoint site where the attacker-provided script is run. Cross-site scripting attacks have emerged as a leading online threat, so Internet Explorer 8 includes a cross-site scripting filter that can detect these types of attacks and disable the harmful scripts. By default, the cross-site scripting filter is turned on in Internet Explorer 8 for the Internet Zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 validate input that is provided to an HTTP query before sending this input to the client.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2010-0817](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0817). The vulnerability was first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 983438](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/983438).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code, published publicly, that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that potentially could be exploited by using the published proof of concept code. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2010-0817](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0817).

## toStaticHTML Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1257

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the SharePoint toStaticHTML API sanitizes HTML, that could allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-1257](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1257).

#### Mitigating Factors for toStaticHTML Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1257

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Only SharePoint sites that use toStaticHTML are potentially affected.

#### Workarounds for toStaticHTML Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1257

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Read e-mails in plain text

  To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of workaround.** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for toStaticHTML Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1257

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks against users of a SharePoint site.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that the toStaticHTML API sanitizes HTML on a SharePoint site.

**What is toStaticHTML?**

The toStaticHTML is an API that can be used to sanitize HTML by removing event attributes and script from user input before it is displayed as HTML. For more information, please see the MSDN Library article, [toStaticHTML Method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc848922%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to "inject" script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of "trusted" sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks against users of a targeted SharePoint site. An attacker could then potentially run script in the security context of the site's users against the target SharePoint site that is using toStaticHTML.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a target SharePoint site. Due to the vulnerability, in specific situations the specially crafted script is not properly sanitized using toStaticHTML, and subsequently this could lead to attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content on the SharePoint site.

For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised SharePoint site for any malicious action to occur. For instance, after an attacker has successfully submitted specially crafted script to the target SharePoint site, any Web page on that SharePoint site that contains the specially crafted script is a potential vector for persistent cross-site scripting attacks. When a user visits a Web page that contains the specially crafted script, the script could be run in the security context of the user on the SharePoint site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where users connect to a SharePoint server, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that toStaticHTML sanitizes HTML content.

**Is this vulnerability related to CVE-2010-1257 in** [**MS10-035**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=190898)**, Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (982381)?**

Yes, the toStaticHTML Information Disclosure Vulnerability, [CVE-2010-1257](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1257), also affects Internet Explorer.

**Are both updates necessary to be installed to be protected from the vulnerability?**

No, each update addresses a separate application. Only the update that corresponds with software running on your system needs to be applied.

## Sharepoint Help Page Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1264

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft SharePoint handles specially crafted requests to the help page. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to the targeted SharePoint server which could cause the Web server to become non-responsive until the associated application pool is restarted.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-1264](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1264).

#### Mitigating Factors for Sharepoint Help Page Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1264

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The attacker cannot run arbitrary code on the target SharePoint server. This is a denial of service vulnerability only.
* The attacker must be authenticated on the SharePoint site in order to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Sharepoint Help Page Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1264

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict Access to SharePoint Help.aspx**

  An administrator can apply an access control list to SharePoint Help.aspx to prevent loading SharePoint Help.aspx. This effectively prevents exploitation of the vulnerability using this attack vector.

  To restrict access to the vulnerable Help.aspx, run the following commands from a command prompt:

  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx" /E /P everyone:N

  ```
  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx" /E /P everyone:N

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** This workaround will disable all help functionality from the SharePoint server.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Run the following commands from a command prompt:

  ```
  takeown /f "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx"

  ```
  ```
  takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx"

  ```
  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx" /E /R everyone

  ```
  ```
  cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\12\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\Help.aspx" /E /R everyone

  ```

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.

To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

* [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** or **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

This security update cannot be removed.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  4. You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  5. Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
