Tor 0.2.2.7-alpha fixes a huge client-side performance bug, as well
as laying the groundwork for further relay-side performance fixes. It
also starts cleaning up client behavior with respect to the EntryNodes,
ExitNodes, and StrictNodes config options.

This release also rotates two directory authority keys, due to a security
breach of some of the Torproject servers:
<http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2010/msg00161.html>

Everybody should upgrade:
<https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en>

Changes in version 0.2.2.7-alpha - 2010-01-19
  o Directory authority changes:
    - Rotate keys (both v3 identity and relay identity) for moria1
      and gabelmoo.

  o Major features (performance):
    - We were selecting our guards uniformly at random, and then weighting
      which of our guards we'd use uniformly at random. This imbalance
      meant that Tor clients were severely limited on throughput (and
      probably latency too) by the first hop in their circuit. Now we
      select guards weighted by currently advertised bandwidth. We also
      automatically discard guards picked using the old algorithm. Fixes
      bug 1217; bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha. Found by Mike Perry.
    - When choosing which cells to relay first, relays can now favor
      circuits that have been quiet recently, to provide lower latency
      for low-volume circuits. By default, relays enable or disable this
      feature based on a setting in the consensus. You can override
      this default by using the new "CircuitPriorityHalflife" config
      option. Design and code by Ian Goldberg, Can Tang, and Chris
      Alexander.
    - Add separate per-conn write limiting to go with the per-conn read
      limiting. We added a global write limit in Tor 0.1.2.5-alpha,
      but never per-conn write limits.
    - New consensus params "bwconnrate" and "bwconnburst" to let us
      rate-limit client connections as they enter the network. It's
      controlled in the consensus so we can turn it on and off for
      experiments. It's starting out off. Based on proposal 163.

  o Major features (relay selection options):
    - Switch to a StrictNodes config option, rather than the previous
      "StrictEntryNodes" / "StrictExitNodes" separation that was missing a
      "StrictExcludeNodes" option.
    - If EntryNodes, ExitNodes, ExcludeNodes, or ExcludeExitNodes
      change during a config reload, mark and discard all our origin
      circuits. This fix should address edge cases where we change the
      config options and but then choose a circuit that we created before
      the change.
    - If EntryNodes or ExitNodes are set, be more willing to use an
      unsuitable (e.g. slow or unstable) circuit. The user asked for it,
      they get it.
    - Make EntryNodes config option much more aggressive even when
      StrictNodes is not set. Before it would prepend your requested
      entrynodes to your list of guard nodes, but feel free to use others
      after that. Now it chooses only from your EntryNodes if any of
      those are available, and only falls back to others if a) they're
      all down and b) StrictNodes is not set.
    - Now we refresh your entry guards from EntryNodes at each consensus
      fetch -- rather than just at startup and then they slowly rot as
      the network changes.

  o Major bugfixes:
    - Stop bridge directory authorities from answering dbg-stability.txt
      directory queries, which would let people fetch a list of all
      bridge identities they track. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.

  o Minor features:
    - Log a notice when we get a new control connection. Now it's easier
      for security-conscious users to recognize when a local application
      is knocking on their controller door. Suggested by bug 1196.
    - New config option "CircuitStreamTimeout" to override our internal
      timeout schedule for how many seconds until we detach a stream from
      a circuit and try a new circuit. If your network is particularly
      slow, you might want to set this to a number like 60.
    - New controller command "getinfo config-text". It returns the
      contents that Tor would write if you send it a SAVECONF command,
      so the controller can write the file to disk itself.
    - New options for SafeLogging to allow scrubbing only log messages
      generated while acting as a relay.
    - Ship the bridges spec file in the tarball too.
    - Avoid a mad rush at the beginning of each month when each client
      rotates half of its guards. Instead we spread the rotation out
      throughout the month, but we still avoid leaving a precise timestamp
      in the state file about when we first picked the guard. Improves
      over the behavior introduced in 0.1.2.17.

  o Minor bugfixes (compiling):
    - Fix compilation on OS X 10.3, which has a stub mlockall() but
      hides it. Bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.
    - Fix compilation on Solaris by removing support for the
      DisableAllSwap config option. Solaris doesn't have an rlimit for
      mlockall, so we cannot use it safely. Fixes bug 1198; bugfix on
      0.2.2.6-alpha.

  o Minor bugfixes (crashes):
    - Do not segfault when writing buffer stats when we haven't observed
      a single circuit to report about. Found by Fabian Lanze. Bugfix on
      0.2.2.1-alpha.
    - If we're in the pathological case where there's no exit bandwidth
      but there is non-exit bandwidth, or no guard bandwidth but there
      is non-guard bandwidth, don't crash during path selection. Bugfix
      on 0.2.0.3-alpha.
    - Fix an impossible-to-actually-trigger buffer overflow in relay
      descriptor generation. Bugfix on 0.1.0.15.

  o Minor bugfixes (privacy):
    - Fix an instance where a Tor directory mirror might accidentally
      log the IP address of a misbehaving Tor client. Bugfix on
      0.1.0.1-rc.
    - Don't list Windows capabilities in relay descriptors. We never made
      use of them, and maybe it's a bad idea to publish them. Bugfix
      on 0.1.1.8-alpha.

  o Minor bugfixes (other):
    - Resolve an edge case in path weighting that could make us misweight
      our relay selection. Fixes bug 1203; bugfix on 0.0.8rc1.
    - Fix statistics on client numbers by country as seen by bridges that
      were broken in 0.2.2.1-alpha. Also switch to reporting full 24-hour
      intervals instead of variable 12-to-48-hour intervals.
    - After we free an internal connection structure, overwrite it
      with a different memory value than we use for overwriting a freed
      internal circuit structure. Should help with debugging. Suggested
      by bug 1055.
    - Update our OpenSSL 0.9.8l fix so that it works with OpenSSL 0.9.8m
      too.

  o Removed features:
    - Remove the HSAuthorityRecordStats option that version 0 hidden
      service authorities could have used to track statistics of overall
      hidden service usage.

Here are some more technical details about the potential impacts, for
those who want to know more about Tor's innards:

----- #1: Directory authority keys

Owning two out of seven directory authorities isn't enough to make a new
networkstatus consensus (you need four for that), but it means you've
only got two more to go. We've generated new v3 long-term identity keys
for these two authorities.

The old v3 long-term identity keys probably aren't compromised, since
they weren't stored on the affected machines, but they signed v3 signing
keys that are valid until 2010-04-12 in the case of moria1 and until
2010-05-04 in the case of gabelmoo. That's still a pretty big window,
so it's best to upgrade clients away from trusting those keys.

You should upgrade to 0.2.1.22 or 0.2.2.7-alpha, which uses the new v3
long-term identity keys (with a new set of signing keys).

----- #2: Relay identity keys

We already have a way to cleanly migrate to a new v3 long-term identity
key, because we needed one for the Debian weak RNG bug:
<http://archives.seul.org/or/announce/May-2008/msg00000.html>

But we don't have a way to cleanly migrate relay identity keys. An
attacker who knows moria1's relay identity key can craft a new descriptor
for it with a new onion key (or even a new IP address), and then
man-in-the-middle traffic coming to the relay. They wouldn't be able to
spoof directory statements, or break the encryption for further relays
in the path, but it still removes one layer of the defense-in-depth.

Normally there's nothing special about the relay identity key (if you
lose yours, just generate another one), but relay identity keys for
directory authorities are hard-coded in the Tor bundle so the client
can detect man-in-the-middle attacks on bootstrapping.

So we abandoned the old relay identity keys too. That means abandoning
the old IP:port the authorities were listening on, or older clients will
produce warn messages whenever they connect to the new authority. Older
Tor clients can now take longer to bootstrap if they try the abandoned
addresses first. (You should upgrade.)

----- #3: Infrastructure services

Moria also hosted our git repository and svn repository. I took the
services offline as soon as we learned of the breach -- in theory a clever
attacker could give out altered files to people who check out the source,
or even tailor his answers based on who's doing the git update. We're
in pretty good shape for git though: the git tree is a set of hashes
all the way back to the root, so when you update your git tree, it will
automatically notice any tampering.

As explained in the last mail, it appears the attackers didn't realize
what they broke into. We had already been slowly migrating Tor services
off of moria (it runs too many services for too many different projects),
so we took this opportunity to speed up that plan. A friendly anonymous
sponsor has provided a pile of new servers, and git and svn are now up
in their new locations. The only remaining Tor infrastructure services on
moria are the directory authority, the mailing lists, and a DNS secondary.

----- #4: Bridge descriptors

The metrics server had an archive of bridge descriptors from 2009.
We used the descriptors to create summary graphs of bridge count and
bridge usage by country, like the ones you can see at
<http://metrics.torproject.org/graphs.html>

So it's conceivable that some bad guy now has a set of historical bridge
data -- meaning he knows addresses and public keys of the bridges, and
presumably some of the bridges are still running at those addresses and/or
with those public keys. He could use this information to help governments
or other censors prevent Tor clients from reaching the Tor network.

I'm not actually so worried about this one though, because a) we didn't
have that many bridges to begin with in 2009 (you should run a bridge!),
b) there seems to be considerable churn in our bridges, so last year's
list doesn't map so well to this year's list), and c) we haven't been
doing a great job lately at keeping China from learning bridges as it is.

Hope that helps to explain,
--Roger

Tor 0.2.1.22 rotates two of the seven v3 directory authority keys and
locations, due to a security breach of some of the Torproject servers:
<http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jan-2010/msg00161.html>

It also fixes a privacy problem in bridge directory authorities -- it
would tell you its whole history of bridge descriptors if you make the
right directory request.

Everybody should upgrade:
<https://www.torproject.org/easy-download>
(Tor Browser Bundle updates coming in the next few days, hopefully.)

Changes in version 0.2.1.22 - 2010-01-19
  o Directory authority changes:
    - Rotate keys (both v3 identity and relay identity) for moria1
      and gabelmoo.

  o Major bugfixes:
    - Stop bridge directory authorities from answering dbg-stability.txt
      directory queries, which would let people fetch a list of all
      bridge identities they track. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

You should upgrade to Tor 0.2.1.22 or 0.2.2.7-alpha:
<https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en>

In early January we discovered that two of the seven directory
authorities were compromised (moria1 and gabelmoo), along with
metrics.torproject.org, a new server we'd recently set up to serve
metrics data and graphs. The three servers have since been reinstalled
with service migrated to other servers.

We made fresh identity keys for the two directory authorities, which is
why you need to upgrade.

Moria also hosted our git repository and svn repository. We took the
services offline as soon as we learned of the breach. It appears the
attackers didn't realize what they broke into -- just that they had
found some servers with lots of bandwidth. The attackers set up some ssh
keys and proceeded to use the three servers for launching other attacks.
We've done some preliminary comparisons, and it looks like git and svn
were not touched in any way.

We've been very lucky the past few years regarding security. It still
seems this breach is unrelated to Tor itself. To be clear, it doesn't
seem that anyone specifically attacked our servers to get at Tor. It
seems we were attacked for the cpu capacity and bandwidth of the servers,
and the servers just happened to also carry out functions for Tor.

We've tried to address the most common questions below.

* Does this mean someone could have matched users up to their
destinations?

No. By design, Tor requires a majority of directory authorities (four
in this case) to generate a consensus; and like other relays in the
Tor network, directory authorities don't know enough to match a user
and traffic or destination.

* Does this mean somebody could have changed the Tor source?

No, we've checked the source. It does mean you should upgrade so your
client knows about all the currently valid directory authorities.

* Does this mean someone could have learned more about Tor than an
ordinary user?

Since our software and specifications are open, everyone already has
access to almost everything on these machines... except some old bridge
descriptors, which we give out only in small batches as entry points for
blocked clients.

* Can I trust Tor's security?

We've taken steps to fix the weaknesses identified and to harden our
systems further. Tor has a track record of openness and transparency,
with its source code and specifications and also with its operations.
Moreover, we're disclosing breaches such as this so you can monitor our
status. You shouldn't assume those who don't disclose security breaches
never have any!
