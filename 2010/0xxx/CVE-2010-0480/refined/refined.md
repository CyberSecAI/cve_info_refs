{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the Microsoft MPEG Layer-3 audio codecs when handling specially crafted AVI files containing an MPEG Layer-3 audio stream.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Users with fewer rights are less impacted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted AVI file.",
      "Receiving specially crafted streaming content from a website or any application that delivers web content."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a malicious AVI file, and either trick a user into opening the file or host it on a website that a user would visit. In a web-based attack, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites; instead, the attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message. In an email attack scenario, the attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an email with a malicious AVI file attached to the user and convincing them to open it.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerable codecs are the MPEG Layer-3 Audio Codec for Microsoft DirectShow (l3codecx.ax) and the Fraunhofer IIS MPEG Layer-3 ACM codecs (L3codeca.acm and L3codecp.acm). While the vulnerable codec is present on Windows Vista, the default Windows Media Player does not use it for decoding AVI files containing MPEG Layer-3 audio; it uses a different, non-vulnerable codec."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2010-0480",
    "remediation": "Apply the security update provided by Microsoft."
