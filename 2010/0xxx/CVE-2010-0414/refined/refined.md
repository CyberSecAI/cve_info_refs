Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-0414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how `gnome-screensaver` handles changes in monitor configurations, specifically when a monitor is unplugged (hotplugging). The screensaver fails to properly manage the unlock dialog and keyboard grab when a monitor is removed while the screen is locked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Handling of Monitor Topology Changes:** The core issue is the lack of proper code paths to manage the disappearance of a monitor while the screen is locked. The unlock dialog and keyboard grab, intended to be secured, become lost or non-functional.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of actions performed rapidly, creating a race condition that the screensaver cannot handle gracefully.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvention of Screen Lock:** A local attacker with physical access can bypass the screen lock, gaining unauthorized access to the user's session.
*   **Denial of Service (Potential):** In some cases, the `gnome-screensaver` may crash or show a black screen, effectively denying the user access to their session until the screensaver is terminated manually.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the system.
*   **Hotplugging (Monitor Unplug):** The primary attack vector involves rapidly unplugging a monitor after moving the unlock dialog to that monitor, which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access to the Target Machine:** The attacker needs to be physically present at the computer to manipulate the monitor connections.
*   **Basic Understanding of Gnome Environment:** The attacker needs to be aware of the screen locking behavior of `gnome-screensaver` and able to manipulate monitors to trigger the bug.

**Steps to Reproduce (from bug report):**

1.  Lock the screen.
2.  Move the mouse cursor to a removable monitor.
3.  Press the "escape" key to cancel the unlock dialog.
4.  Move the mouse to a new head (presumably a different monitor) to bring up the unlock dialog there.
5.  Unplug the monitor.
6.  Quickly press keys on the keyboard.

**Additional Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability was introduced during the development cycle of gnome 2.24.
*   Autoconfiguration of hotplugged monitors was introduced in gnome 2.28, which made this exploit possible
*   The fix involves migrating the lock dialog and keyboard grab to an attached head if they would otherwise be dropped during monitor removal.
*  The affected version was gnome-screensaver 2.28.
