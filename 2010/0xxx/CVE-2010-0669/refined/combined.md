Package        : moin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-0668 CVE-2010-0669 CVE-2010-0717
Debian Bugs    : 569975

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in moin, a python clone of
WikiWiki.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2010-0668

Multiple security issues in MoinMoin related to configurations that have
a non-empty superuser list, the xmlrpc action enabled, the SyncPages
action enabled, or OpenID configured.

CVE-2010-0669

MoinMoin does not properly sanitize user profiles.

CVE-2010-0717

The default configuration of cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded in MoinMoin
does not prevent unsafe package actions.

In addition, this update fixes an error when processing hierarchical ACLs,
which can be exploited to access restricted sub-pages.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.1-3+lenny3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.2-1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your moin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian (stable)
- ---------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

No, this is rather to handle stuff consistently.

Fixed by 1.8.7 (and soon by 1.9.2).

BTW, I need a 3rd CVE for user profile input sanitizing (all moin
versions), also fixed in 1.8.7 (and soon by 1.9.2).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request -- MoinMoin -- 1.8.7

Hi Steve, vendors,

   multiple security issues have been reported against
different versions of MoinMoin -- complete list here:
   [1] <http://moinmo.in/SecurityFixes> (part moin 1.9.1)

Yesterday (2010-02-14) MoinMoin-1.8.7 was released:
   [2] <http://moinmo.in/>

fixing "major security issues in miscellaneous parts of moin":
   [3] <http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinRelease1.8>
   [4] <http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.8/raw-file/1.8.7/docs/CHANGES>

 From what I can tell, when mapping [4] to [1] the:
   a, "A major security issue was discovered that could affect
       all moin versions 1.5.0 up to and including 1.9.1. For now,
       you can avoid the issue by not having any user names in your
       superuser list" was fixed.
   b, "Exclude (disable) xmlrpc and SyncPages actions" -- this was
       'only' disabled -- "Improved package security:
       cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded excludes unsafe or otherwise
       questionable package actions by default now.".
       Though there are xmlrpc related fixes in 1.8.7:
       "xmlrpc:
        * Process attachname in get/putAttachment similarly.
        * revertPage: convert pagename to internal representation." --
        Thomas are these also security related fixes?

   c, " Do not use OpenID auth code" -- not sure about state of this.

Also, Changes file for MoinMoin 1.9.1 mentions:
   [5] <http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.9/raw-file/1.9.1/docs/CHANGES>

    d, "* Fixed sys.argv security issue." -- not sure, if this is
       v1.9.1 specific or affects also prior versions of MoinMoin.

Other references:
   [6] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569975>

Last message in:
   [7] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569975#10>
suggests only the "superuser list" issue was fixed in 1.8.7
and more fixes are about to come -- "<ThomasWaldmann>
1.9.2 planned in about 1 or 2 weeks".

Cc-ed Thomas Waldmann on this post, so he can detail
what was fixed to know, how many CVE identifiers are needed / sufficient
for MoinMoin of version v.1.8.7.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
