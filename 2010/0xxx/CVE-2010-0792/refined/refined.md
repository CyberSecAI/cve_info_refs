Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-0792:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from race conditions within the `fcrontab` utility, a part of the `fcron` scheduler. These race conditions can be exploited through the use of symbolic links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Conditions:** The core issue is the presence of race conditions, where multiple operations occur in an unpredictable order, leading to a security vulnerability.
*   **Symbolic Link Exploitation:** Attackers can leverage symbolic links to manipulate the file access behavior of `fcrontab`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is unauthorized information disclosure.
    *   On systems where `fcrontab` runs with its own "fcron" group, an attacker can read the crontabs and `fcron` configuration files of other non-root users.
    *   On systems where `fcrontab` is installed with setuid root permissions, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
*   **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the race conditions by creating and manipulating symbolic links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a local user account on the target system.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links within the file system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `fcrontab`, which is part of the `fcron` scheduler.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Dan Rosenberg.
*   A fix was released in `fcron` version 3.0.5.
*   The vulnerability is officially identified as CVE-2010-0792.
