This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\nThe Apache HTTP server running on Windows platforms contains a flaw in mod_isapi which could enable an attacker to unload ISAPI.dll before request processing is complete. An attacker can send a specially-crafted request and RESET packet to the server, resulting in ISAPI.dll being unloaded. Additional requests can result in memory corruption.

This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.\nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank Brett Gervasoni of Sense of Security for reporting and proposing a patch fix for this issue.\n| Reported to security team | 2010-02-09 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Issue public | 2010-03-02 |\n| Update 2.2.15 released | 2010-03-05 |\n| Update 2.0.64 released | 2010-10-19 |\n| Affects | 2.2.14, 2.2.13, 2.2.12, 2.2.11, 2.2.10, 2.2.9, 2.2.8, 2.2.6, 2.2.5, 2.2.4, 2.2.3, 2.2.2, 2.2.0, 2.0.63, 2.0.61, 2.0.59, 2.0.58, 2.0.55, 2.0.54, 2.0.53, 2.0.52, 2.0.51, 2.0.50, 2.0.49, 2.0.48, 2.0.47, 2.0.46, 2.0.45, 2.0.44, 2.0.43, 2.0.42, 2.0.40, 2.0.39, 2.0.37 |"

      "information": "Apache 2.2.14 mod_isapi - Dangling Pointer Remote SYSTEM\n\nDescription:\npwn-isapi.cpp exploits a dangling pointer vulnerabilty in Apache 2.2.14 mod_isapi.\nDue to the nature of the vulnerability, and exploitation method, DEP should be limited to essential\nWindows programs and services. At worst, if DEP is enabled for the Apache process, you could cause\na constant DoS by looping this (since apache will automatically restart) :)\n\nNote that the exploit code may need to be run multiple times before a shell is spawned (70%\nsuccess rate - tested on three different systems). Furthermore, the exploit code may require\nmodification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms. This is due to loaded memory\nreferences to the unloaded DLL (they will be different for each ISAPI module). Do not test\nthis code in a VM otherwise the code may fail to send the RESET packet (something to do with\nVMware gracefully closing the connection, instead of sending a RESET packet) - I didnt want\nto have to use raw packets on Windows.\n\nShellcode Note:\nThe shellcode writes \"pwn-isapi\" to \"sos.txt\" which is created in the current working directory.\nMost operating systems should be supported by this shellcode. I've used Skylined's method of finding\nthe base address of kernel32.dll for Windows 7 and modified it so that it will find the base\naddress of msvcrt.dll instead. I've also added another check so that it will be able to detect\n\"msvcrt.dll\" on Windows Server 2003 (this OS loads msvcrt.dll in 5th position, and before this\nDLL string is read, another DLL (RPCRT4.dll) length is verifiied which matches the length of\nmsvcrt.dll. So the added check will verify the presents of \"m\" before proceeding.\n\nAuthor:\nBrett Gervasoni (brettg [at] senseofsecurity.com.au)\n\nPlatform: Windows\nVulnerable App: Apache 2.2.14\n"

    "root_cause": "The `mod_isapi` module in Apache HTTP Server attempts to unload the ISAPI DLL prematurely when it encounters certain error conditions during request processing.

    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on Windows systems running vulnerable versions of Apache with `mod_isapi` enabled. The Apache process, which often runs with `SYSTEM` privileges on Windows, can be exploited to gain full control over the system.",

      "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to a URL handled by mod_isapi causing the ISAPI DLL to unload prematurely",

       "additional_information": "The vulnerability is specific to Windows platforms, as mod_isapi is only available on Windows. The mod_isapi module is not enabled by default. Exploitation typically requires two steps: first triggering the premature unload of the DLL, and then sending another request to exploit the dangling pointer. This exploit can be unreliable, requiring multiple attempts. It is also recommended not to test in a VM as reset packets might not be correctly sent by the VM."
