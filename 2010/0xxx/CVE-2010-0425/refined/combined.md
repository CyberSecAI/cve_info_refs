  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  The unloading of ISAPI DLL's in mid-request during error cases
  has been removed, which eliminates the chance for later phases
  of apache processing to call into the unloaded DLL.

  ISAPI DLL's are now only unloaded during the final cleanup of a
  request when no further callbacks are possible.

  ```

### VMware Workstation, Player, and ACE address several security issues.

##### VMware Security Advisory

#####

VMware Security Advisory Advisory ID:VMSA-2010-0014.1VMware Security Advisory Synopsis:VMware Workstation, Player, and ACE address several security issues.VMware Security Advisory Issue date:2010-09-23VMware Security Advisory Updated on:2011-09-19VMware Security Advisory CVE numbers:

##### 1. Summary

VMware Workstation and Player address a potential installer security issue and security issues in libpng. VMware ACE Management Server (AMS) for Windows updates Apache httpd.

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware Workstation 7.1.1 and earlier,

VMware Workstation 6.5.4 and earlier,

VMware Player 3.1.1 and earlier,

VMware Player 2.5.4 and earlier,

VMware ACE Management Server 2.7.1 and earlier,

Note: VMware Server was declared End Of Availability on January 2010, support will be limited to Technical Guidance for the duration of the support term.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware Workstation and Player installer security issue

The Workstation 7.x and Player 3.x installers will load an index.htm file located in the current working directory on which Workstation 7.x or Player 3.x is being installed. This may allow an attacker to display a malicious file if they manage to get their file onto the system prior to installation.
The issue can only be exploited at the time that Workstation 7.x or Player 3.x is being installed. Installed versions of Workstation and Player are not affected. The security issue is no longer present in the installer of the new versions of Workstation 7.x and Player 3.x (see table below for the version numbers).
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-3277 to this issue.
VMware would like to thank Alexander Trofimov and Marc Esher for independently reporting this issue to VMware.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

\* Note: This only affects the installer, if you have a version of Workstation or Player installed you are not vulnerable.

#####

b. Third party libpng updated to version 1.2.44

A buffer overflow condition in libpng is addressed that could potentially lead to code execution with the privileges of the application using libpng. Two potential denial of service issues are also addressed in the update.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2010-1205, CVE-2010-0205, CVE-2010-2249 to these issues.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

c. VMware ACE Management Server (AMS) for Windows updates Apache httpd

A function in Apache HTTP Server when multithreaded MPM is used does not properly handle headers in subrequests in certain circumstances which may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted request that triggers access to memory locations associated with an earlier request.
The Apache mod\_isapi module can be forced to unload a specific library before the processing of a request is complete, resulting in memory corruption. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2010-0434 and CVE-2010-0425 to the issues addressed in this update.
Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

## Apache mod\_isapi module library unload results in orphaned callback pointers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#280613

Original Release Date: 2010-03-11 | Last Revised: 2010-03-11

---

### Overview

The Apache mod\_isapi module can be forced to unload a specific library before the processing of a request is complete, resulting in memory corruption. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The Apache HTTP server running on Windows platforms contains a flaw in mod\_isapi which could enable an attacker to unload ISAPI.dll before request processing is complete. An attacker can send a specially-crafted request and RESET packet to the server, resulting in ISAPI.dll being unloaded. Additional requests can result in memory corruption.  This vulnerability affects Apache httpd versions 2.2.14, 2.2.13, 2.2.12, 2.2.11, 2.2.10, 2.2.9, 2.2.8, 2.2.6, 2.2.5, 2.2.4, 2.2.3, 2.2.2, 2.2.0, 2.0.63, 2.0.61, 2.0.59, 2.0.58, 2.0.55, 2.0.54, 2.0.53, 2.0.52, 2.0.51, 2.0.50, 2.0.49, 2.0.48, 2.0.47, 2.0.46, 2.0.45, 2.0.44, 2.0.43, 2.0.42, 2.0.40, 2.0.39, and 2.0.37. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial of service condition or execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the Apache process. Because the Apache service typically runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows platforms, an attacker may be able to gain complete control of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Patch**The [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/) has released httpd 2.2.15 and 2.0.64-dev, which address this and other issues. Updates can be found on the Apache [httpd website](http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi). |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.34

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### important: mod\_ssl Null Pointer Dereference ([CVE-2017-3169](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3169))

mod\_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call ap\_hook\_process\_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port.

### important: ap\_find\_token() Buffer Overread ([CVE-2017-7668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7668))

The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap\_find\_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap\_find\_token() to return an incorrect value.

### important: Uninitialized memory reflection in mod\_auth\_digest ([CVE-2017-9788](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9788))

The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments. by mod\_auth\_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.

### moderate: mod\_userdir CRLF injection ([CVE-2016-4975](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4975))

Possible CRLF injection allowing HTTP response splitting attacks for sites which use mod\_userdir. This issue was mitigated by changes made in 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 which prohibit CR or LF injection into the "Location" or other outbound header key or value.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Brett Gervasoni of Sense of Security for reporting and proposing a patch fix for this issue.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### moderate: mod\_status cross-site scripting ([CVE-2006-5752](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-5752))

A flaw was found in the mod\_status module. On sites where the server-status page is publicly accessible and ExtendedStatus is enabled this could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. Note that the server-status page is not enabled by default and it is best practice to not make this publicly available.

### moderate: mod\_proxy crash ([CVE-2007-3847](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3847))

A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod\_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.

/*
 * Apache 2.2.14 mod_isapi Dangling Pointer Remote SYSTEM Exploit (CVE-2010-0425)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Advisory: http://www.senseofsecurity.com.au/advisories/SOS-10-002
 *
 * Description:
 * pwn-isapi.cpp exploits a dangling pointer vulnerabilty in Apache 2.2.14 mod_isapi.
 * Due to the nature of the vulnerability, and exploitation method, DEP should be limited to essential
 * Windows programs and services. At worst, if DEP is enabled for the Apache process, you could cause
 * a constant DoS by looping this (since apache will automatically restart) :)
 *
 * Note that the exploit code may need to be run multiple times before a shell is spawned (70%
 * success rate - tested on three different systems). Furthermore, the exploit code may require
 * modification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms. This is due to loaded memory
 * references to the unloaded DLL (they will be different for each ISAPI module). Do not test
 * this code in a VM otherwise the code may fail to send the RESET packet (something to do with
 * VMware gracefully closing the connection, instead of sending a RESET packet) - I didnt want
 * to have to use raw packets on Windows.
 *
 * Shellcode Note:
 * The shellcode writes "pwn-isapi" to "sos.txt" which is created in the current working directory.
 * Most operating systems should be supported by this shellcode. I've used Skylined's method of finding
 * the base address of kernel32.dll for Windows 7 and modified it so that it will find the base
 * address of msvcrt.dll instead. I've also added another check so that it will be able to detect
 * "msvcrt.dll" on Windows Server 2003 (this OS loads msvcrt.dll in 5th position, and before this
 * DLL string is read, another DLL (RPCRT4.dll) length is verifiied which matches the length of
 * msvcrt.dll. So the added check will verify the presents of "m" before proceeding.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.0 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.0. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.0 has had no new releases since 2013 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before August 2013. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.0 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.65

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### moderate: mod\_proxy reverse proxy exposure ([CVE-2011-3368](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3368))

An exposure was found when using mod\_proxy in reverse proxy mode. In certain configurations using RewriteRule with proxy flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause the reverse proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers not directly accessible to attacker. No update of 1.3 will be released.

Patches will be published to https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply\_to\_1.3.42/

### low: APR apr\_palloc heap overflow ([CVE-2009-2412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2412))

A flaw in apr\_palloc() in the bundled copy of APR could cause heap overflows in programs that try to apr\_palloc() a user controlled size. The Apache HTTP Server itself does not pass unsanitized user-provided sizes to this function, so it could only be triggered through some other application which uses apr\_palloc() in a vulnerable way.

### low: expat DoS ([CVE-2009-3720](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3720))

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the bundled expat library. An attacker who is able to get Apache to parse an untrused XML document (for example through mod\_dav) may be able to cause a crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM.

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Brett Gervasoni of Sense of Security for reporting and proposing a patch fix for this issue.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### low: Path revealing exposures ([CVE-2002-0654](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0654))

A path-revealing exposure was present in multiview type map negotiation (such as the default error documents) where a module would report the full path of the typemapped .var file when multiple documents or no documents could be served. Additionally a path-revealing exposure in cgi/cgid when Apache fails to invoke a script. The modules would report "couldn't create child process /path-to-script/script.pl" revealing the full path of the script.
