Hi,

sorry about being rather vague in what I told/tell about the issues, but
this is just to protect the vulnerable systems out there until fixes are
available and have been widely deployed (or at least every admin
interested in security had a chance).

All the recently discovered issues are basically just 2 issues (the
sys.argv issue in 1.9 and the other issue more or less in all moin
versions at different places in the code).

> Last message in:
>    [[7]](#7) <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569975#10>
> suggests only the "superuser list" issue was fixed in 1.8.7

No, all known issues that affect 1.8 (and also all versions before) were
fixed in 1.8.7.

> and more fixes are about to come -- "<ThomasWaldmann>
> 1.9.2 planned in about 1 or 2 weeks".

1.9.2 will fix all known issues that affect 1.9.

The sys.argv issue was already fixed by 1.9.1.

BTW, we won't do a new 1.7.x release, but the fixes can be pulled from
the repo. Likely this is interesting for package maintainers who have to
support 1.7.x packages with security fixes. Users who just manually
downloaded and installed 1.7.x are advised to just do an easy upgrade to
1.8.7 (or even 1.9.2 soon, with a bit more work needed).

> what was fixed to know, how many CVE identifiers are needed / sufficient
> for MoinMoin of version v.1.8.7.

I am not very familiar with CVE stuff, but as there are 2 fundamental
problems that have been fixed, I guess 2 CVEs are right.

a) one CVE for the sys.argv issue in 1.9 that was fixed in 1.9.1
b) one CVE for the other kind of issues in all moin versions, fixed by
1.8.7 and soon by 1.9.2

Regards,

Thomas

Message-ID: <4B79880A.5040500@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 2010 18:44:42 +0100
From: Jan Lieskovsky <jlieskov@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE Request -- MoinMoin -- 1.8.7

Hi Steve, vendors,

   multiple security issues have been reported against
different versions of MoinMoin -- complete list here:
   [1] <http://moinmo.in/SecurityFixes> (part moin 1.9.1)

Yesterday (2010-02-14) MoinMoin-1.8.7 was released:
   [2] <http://moinmo.in/>

fixing "major security issues in miscellaneous parts of moin":
   [3] <http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinRelease1.8>
   [4] <http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.8/raw-file/1.8.7/docs/CHANGES>

 From what I can tell, when mapping [4] to [1] the:
   a, "A major security issue was discovered that could affect
       all moin versions 1.5.0 up to and including 1.9.1. For now,
       you can avoid the issue by not having any user names in your
       superuser list" was fixed.
   b, "Exclude (disable) xmlrpc and SyncPages actions" -- this was
       'only' disabled -- "Improved package security:
       cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded excludes unsafe or otherwise
       questionable package actions by default now.".
       Though there are xmlrpc related fixes in 1.8.7:
       "xmlrpc:
        * Process attachname in get/putAttachment similarly.
        * revertPage: convert pagename to internal representation." --
        Thomas are these also security related fixes?

   c, " Do not use OpenID auth code" -- not sure about state of this.

Also, Changes file for MoinMoin 1.9.1 mentions:
   [5] <http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.9/raw-file/1.9.1/docs/CHANGES>

    d, "* Fixed sys.argv security issue." -- not sure, if this is
       v1.9.1 specific or affects also prior versions of MoinMoin.

Other references:
   [6] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569975>

Last message in:
   [7] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569975#10>
suggests only the "superuser list" issue was fixed in 1.8.7
and more fixes are about to come -- "<ThomasWaldmann>
1.9.2 planned in about 1 or 2 weeks".

Cc-ed Thomas Waldmann on this post, so he can detail
what was fixed to know, how many CVE identifiers are needed / sufficient
for MoinMoin of version v.1.8.7.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Please rebase to v1.8.7.  These issues affect the versions of the Moin package, as present in EPEL-4 and EPEL-5 repositories (see [1] for list of affected versions of Moin). Please try to rebase EPEL versions of Moin to v1.8.7 version too, if possible.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=565604#c2)  Ville-Pekka Vainio    2010-02-15 22:17:35 UTC  ``` OK, a few points:  1) I'll try to get a 1.8.7 update out in a few days for Fedora 11 and 12.  2) I've orphaned the Moin packages in EPEL, currently those have no maintainer. I'm not interested in trying to do any security fixes for them, 1.5 is not maintained by upstream anymore and the wiki data format is different from 1.8. The EPEL packages are pretty much a security nightmare, but so is trying to release an update to 1.8.7, as that would break all wikis which are possibly still running on the EPEL packages.  3) I won't go hunting for "1.9.2pre" patches from the mercurial repositories. If upstream does not want to disclose any more details on the 1.9.1 vulnerabilities, then I'll just wait for them to release 1.9.2. As 1.9.1 is only in Rawhide, I think (and hope) no one is running production wikis on it yet.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=565604#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-02-16 09:45:19 UTC  ``` Hi Ville,     thanks for tracking the plan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: python-moinmoin: Serious security issue in all moinmoin versions
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 2010 09:29:04 -0600
```
Package: python-moinmoin
Version: 1.5.3-1.2etch2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Per <http://moinmo.in/SecurityFixes>, there is a major security issue in
moin.  It affects all moin versions from "1.5.0 up to and including
1.9.1".

This means that all of these versions are vulnerable:

etch (oldstable): 1.5.3-1.2etch2

lenny (stable): 1.7.1-3+lenny2

squeeze (testing) & sid (unstable): 1.9.1-1

The Moin team has released 1.8.7, which patches the issue in 1.8.6.
They have not yet issued a patch for any other branch, including the
1.9.1 branch, although it appears that they are working on it.  That
patch may be instructive on patching these other versions.

The security team can coordinate this with Thomas Waldmann, who has
contact information at <http://moinmo.in/ThomasWaldmann> and is on
FreeNode as ThomasWaldmann.

Here is an IRC conversation transcript:

<CosmicRay> Hi folks.  Question about the security problems: 1) am I
right that there is no fix for 1.9.1 right now?  2) What's the deal with
SecurityFixes/Installation referencing patches on SecurityFixes?  I'm
not seeing any recent patches on SecurityFixes.  Has your policy for
that stuff changed?
<ThomasWaldmann> 1) yes, but soon
<ThomasWaldmann> (except if you want to pull from repository, stuff is
fixed there, but we are still testing, translators might need a bit to
finish translation)
<ThomasWaldmann> 2) it's not just a single patch, it is quite much, you
don't want to apply them manually. if you need it now, do a repo
checkout and you'll have 1.9.2pre kind of
<ThomasWaldmann> and I am intentionally being rather vague on that page
and not (yet?) linking to changesets, because disclosing too much info
is dangerous for unpatched sites
<ThomasWaldmann> 1.9.2 planned in about 1 or 2 weeks

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2014-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Giuseppe Iuculano
March 12, 2010                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : moin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-0668 CVE-2010-0669 CVE-2010-0717
Debian Bugs    : 569975

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in moin, a python clone of
WikiWiki.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2010-0668

Multiple security issues in MoinMoin related to configurations that have
a non-empty superuser list, the xmlrpc action enabled, the SyncPages
action enabled, or OpenID configured.

CVE-2010-0669

MoinMoin does not properly sanitize user profiles.

CVE-2010-0717

The default configuration of cfg.packagepages_actions_excluded in MoinMoin
does not prevent unsafe package actions.

In addition, this update fixes an error when processing hierarchical ACLs,
which can be exploited to access restricted sub-pages.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.1-3+lenny3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.2-1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your moin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian (stable)
- ---------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
