Forged to be secure
[SHOP HARD](/en/usb-flash-drives/encrypted)

# Don't let your data be a soft target.

Only hardware encryption gives your data the defence it deserves. Fortunately, the on-the-go secure storage solutions by Kingston IronKey™ don’t have any soft edges.

#### Non-encrypted drives

When data is taken outside of the office, your existing cybersecurity and data loss prevention policies can no longer keep you safe, making your data a soft target. Luckily IronKey drives provide on-the-go file storage with the ultimate portable security strategy.

#### Software-encrypted drives

The hard truth is that software-based encryption isn't enough. While it has its advantages, it may not match its perception as being comprehensive. It's only as secure as the device it is used on. In contrast, hardware-based encryption offers a more robust solution. So, if you’re only software-secure, it’s time to harden defences.

#### Cloud storage

The cloud is not under your control. With unlimited password attempts, your files can continuously get attacked. Fortunately, IronKey devices meet the toughest security and compliance standards.

## Give your data a HARD defence.

## Ask an expert

Planning the right solution requires an understanding of your project's security goals. Let Kingston's experts guide you on how to best defend your sensitive data.

![Why choose IronKey](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/IronKey_promo_why_choose-lg.jpg "Why choose Kingston IronKey")

## Why choose Kingston IronKey™?

With the power and pedigree of Kingston Technology forged into every product, trust that your data is truly secure when it’s secured by Kingston IronKey.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/data-protection.svg)
#### Hardware-encrypted storage options for data protection

Safeguard important data with FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified, FIPS 197 certified and XTS-AES 256-bit encryption capable devices. Additionally, there are built-in protections against BadUSB and brute force attacks.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/Ironkey-user-pin.svg)
#### Multi-password option for data recovery

Enable Admin, User and One-Time Recovery passwords. Admin can reset a User password and create a One-Time Recovery password to restore User’s access to data. Brute force attack protection locks out User or One-Time Recovery passwords if 10 invalid passwords are entered in a row, and crypto-erases the drive if the Admin password is entered incorrectly 10 times in a row.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/ironkey_passphrase_mode.svg)
#### Passphrase mode

Select between Complex or Passphrase password mode. Passphrases can be a numeric PIN, sentence with space characters, list of words or even lyrics – from 10 to 64 characters long.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/dual-read-only.svg)
#### Dual read-only (write-protect) settings

Avoid malware attacks with a forced Read-Only mode set by Admin for User, or a session based Read-Only mode set by Admin or User.

![](https://media.kingston.com/kingston/landing/ironkey/locally-manage.svg)
#### Locally manage drives for small and medium businesses

Use Admin role to locally manage employee User and One-Time Recovery passwords, recover data access on locked drives, and comply with laws and regulations when forensics are required.

## IronKey origins

IronKey Inc. was an internet security and data privacy company established in 1996. IronKey received a grant from the US Department of Homeland Security in 2004 to develop a secure, tamper-resistant USB Flash drive, primarily for use by the US government and military. The IronKey brand soon grew quickly as the need for secure portable devices became evident: the biggest security threat to corporate and government users was the frequent loss or theft of data stored on USB drives.

In 2016, Kingston Technology, which had been manufacturing and delivering hardware-encrypted products since 2007, purchased IronKey. “Kingston IronKey” was born – and became the largest, best-known maker of hardware-encrypted USB drives in the world..
