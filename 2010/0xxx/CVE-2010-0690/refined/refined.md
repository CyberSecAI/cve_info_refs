Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-0690

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `pfid` parameter within the `index.php` script of the Video Games Rentals Script application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied data passed through the `pfid` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The unsanitized input from the `pfid` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database interactions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass normal authentication mechanisms, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, including:
    - Administrator usernames and passwords.
    - Other data within the database such as customer information, rental records, etc.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could also modify data within the database, potentially corrupting information or altering application behavior.
- **Complete System Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be chained with other vulnerabilities to gain more extensive access to the underlying system (although this exploit focuses solely on accessing database information).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the application's `index.php` page. The attacker manipulates the `pfid` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** A basic understanding of SQL syntax is required to craft the injection payload. The exploit example utilizes a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `rental_admin` table.

**Exploit Details:**
The provided exploit demonstrates the vulnerability by using the following URL structure:

`http://[server]/index.php?view=catalog&pfid=-5+union+select+1,concat(admin_name,0x3a,admin_password),3,4,5+from+rental_admin--&item_type=G`

This URL injects an SQL `UNION SELECT` statement that retrieves the `admin_name` and `admin_password` from the `rental_admin` table.
