**CVE-2010-0523**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the Wiki Server allowing users to upload active content, specifically Java applets, without proper security measures.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control when handling uploaded applets. This allows a maliciously crafted applet to be uploaded.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can exploit this by uploading a malicious Java applet, and tricking a Wiki Server user into viewing it, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to upload a malicious Java applet to the Wiki Server and then persuade a user to view the applet.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote user with the ability to upload content to the Wiki Server.
