{
  "CVE-2010-0476": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists because the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation improperly parses specially crafted SMB transaction responses.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper parsing of SMB transaction responses, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can host a specially crafted SMB server and convince a user to initiate an SMB connection with it. Also, a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed on the local network to respond to a legitimate SMB request with a malformed SMB response.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to either host a malicious SMB server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the local network. They need to be able to craft a malformed SMB response."
