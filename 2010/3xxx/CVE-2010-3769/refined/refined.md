Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs in line-breaking routines when `document.write()` is called with a very long string on Windows platforms. The line breaking routines fail to handle the long string appropriately, resulting in an invalid memory read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
*   **Buffer overflow:** The primary issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the line-breaking routines of Mozilla products (Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird) when handling extremely long strings passed to `document.write()`.
*   **Lack of bounds checking:** The code doesn't adequately validate the length of the string being processed in the line-breaking routine, causing a buffer overflow.
*   **Memory corruption:** The buffer overflow leads to writing data past the end of an allocated buffer or reading from unallocated memory, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Crash:** The vulnerability can be triggered to cause a crash in the affected application (Firefox, SeaMonkey, or Thunderbird).
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer by exploiting the memory corruption that leads to a crash. This could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Web page:** A malicious web page could contain JavaScript code that calls `document.write()` with an excessively long string, triggering the vulnerability.
*   **Document.write:** The `document.write()` method acts as the entry point for the malicious string, which is then passed to the vulnerable line-breaking routines.
*   **Browsing:** A user visiting the malicious web page with a vulnerable version of Firefox, SeaMonkey, or Thunderbird could be exposed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by hosting the malicious web page or injecting the malicious code into an existing web page.
*   **User interaction:** The user must visit the malicious webpage to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Basic web knowledge:** The attacker needs basic web development knowledge to craft malicious Javascript that exploits the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details**
*   The crash occurs in the Uniscribe library on Windows, indicating a problem in how Mozillaâ€™s code interacts with the OS's text-handling routines.
*   The root cause of the issue was found to be an error in how the length of the string was being passed to `InitTextRun` functions during line breaking. The length of the original string was being passed rather than the actual length after string processing, which resulted in an out-of-bounds read.
*   The vulnerability was initially detected on Windows XP but was also found to affect other platforms like MacOS 10.

The fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring that the proper length of the string is passed to text processing routines, thus preventing the buffer overflow.
