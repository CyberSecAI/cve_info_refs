How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hey,

Excerpts from Moritz Muehlenhoff's message of Thu Sep 30 23:13:56 +0200 2010:

Right. I didn't finish wading through all Changesets. ;)

> Horde:
> <http://lists.horde.org/archives/announce/2010/000568.html>
>

>From that link:
>     * Fixed an XSS vulnerability in util/icon_browser.php.

CVE-2010-3077. Also fixed in Horde Application Framework 3.3.9.

>     * Fixed an XSS vulnerability in the Fetchmail configuration.

CVE n/a. Also fixed in Horde IMP 4.3.8
Reference: <http://git.horde.org/diff.php/imp/fetchmailprefs.php?rt=horde&r1=1.39.4.10&r2=1.39.4.11>

>     * Fixed an XSS vulnerability when showing mailbox names.

CVE n/a. Also fixed in Horde DIMP 1.1.5
Reference: <http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/9240>

>     * Protected preference forms against CSRF attacks.

CVE n/a. Also fixed in Horde Application Framework 3.3.9.
Reference: <http://secunia.com/advisories/39860>

> Dimp (Dynamic Imp):
> <http://lists.horde.org/archives/announce/2010/000561.html>
>

Already handled above (mailbox name XSS)

> Imp4
> <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2010-09/0379.html>
>

Already handled above (fetchmail XSS)

Additionally, CVE-2010-0463 (DNS prefetching) was resolved in IMP 4.3.8
and DIMP 1.1.5.
Reference: <http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/8836#c14>

Finally, there is the Gollem XSS which just got CVE-2010-3447 from Josh.

This should now be the complete list of fixes in the latest Horde
updates (I hope). Josh, can you also assign CVEs to the rest of the
issues?

Thanks,
Alex

There appear to be quite a few new issues related to Horde and
related packages. AFAICT the issues mentioned below are also new
and haven't been assigned CVE IDs?

Horde:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : imp4
Vulnerability  : Insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3695
Debian Bug     : 598584

Moritz Naumann discovered that imp4, a webmail component for the horde
framework, is prone to cross-site scripting attacks by a lack of input
sanitising of certain fetchmail information.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2-4lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.7+debian0-2.1, which was already included in the squeeze
release.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.3.7+debian0-2.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your imp4 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
