{
  "CVE-2010-3182": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the script that launches Firefox. The LD\\_LIBRARY\\_PATH variable was appending a \".\" character, which could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running Firefox, if that user ran Firefox from within an attacker-controlled directory.",
    "Root cause": "The Firefox launch script incorrectly appends a '.' to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows loading of libraries from the current directory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.",
        "The script appends a \".\" to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, making it vulnerable to loading malicious libraries from the current directory."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a user running Firefox if the user launches Firefox from an attacker-controlled directory.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to control a directory, and trick another user to execute firefox from within this directory. This can be done by getting the victim user to download a malicious library and then running Firefox from the same directory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access is required for the exploit. The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious library in a directory where a victim user might launch Firefox from."
