How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

   Global intelligence

IBM Trusteer analyzes devices on several levels. Device attributes are reviewed and checked for spoofing and abnormalities. Devices are then checked for malware before being scanned for other cybercriminal tools
such as emulators, screen overlays and remote access tools.

Network information is crucial in determining the risk associated with a potential fraudulent activity. Trusteer checks for the location, carrier or hosting service while also detecting whether a VPN is being used or a call is in progress on the device because these are common social engineering techniques.

Behavior of a user can be assessed by looking at behavioral biometrics such as swipes, keystrokes, mouse movements, session length and more. These can be compared to previous user sessions and flagged if discrepancies are detected.

Data relating to the user’s accounts can be key in determining whether a cybercriminal is performing fraudulent activities. Transactional data such as amounts, targeted accounts and transactional types alongside account opening data can be analyzed and used to prevent funneling of funds to criminals.

IBM Trusteer employs a team of world-class threat experts that constantly monitor the dark web to identify emerging threats and devise ways to detect them. In addition, they tap into a global intelligence network of millions of devices across 190 countries by using a unique and persistent fingerprint for every device.

After discussion today, we agreed that it would be nice if each context got its own Math.random() seed, to reduce the risk of things like cross-site tracking based on randomness seed.

The attached patch makes the RNG context-local and seeds it when the context is created. In addition to time the context pointer and its successor pointer are used for the seed, in case we bring up a number of contexts at the same time.

dmandelin suggested seeding with the context pointer. dolske suggested making sure we don't just seed with one pointer.

For the first context, |cx == cx->link.next| as I understand it, so the seed is thus |timeSecs ^ (a ^ a)|, which collapses to |(timeSecs ^ 0) == timeSecs|. The first context in the browser is apparently for the JS component loader, so it's going to be long-lived. If we're really worried about pages snooping on each other in this way, we should be worried about pages snooping on components which might possibly take user-affected inputs (foxyproxy would be one such component) and which use Math.random() (fewer still, but not out of the question). The first context even runs privileged code, making it more interesting to attack. I suggest making the last piece of this int64(JS\_LIKELY(cx->link.next != cx) ? cx->link.next : 0) as a precaution in this case so we'll actually do a small amount of fudging to an otherwise time-based seed in that case.

Although, I suppose in that case the reverse-engineer-the-JSContext\* attack is then feasible again; that probably doesn't matter that much, but if it does we could always use |cx->runtime| instead.
We really need to decide on a cryptographically-secure random number generation API, propose it for ES6, and implement it. This half-concern, half-you're-doing-it-wrong attitude we have is just making more and more work for us.

No, there's a header, rt->contextList.

No one is going to use a new API (especially one that can't be emulated if not supplied by older browsers) for years.
Anyway [bug 322529](/show_bug.cgi?id=322529 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade Math.random() to the better XorShift128+ algorithm") proposes to strengthen Math.random() sufficiently. Then the only fear is stupid ND benchmarketing noticing the regression.

The only nit I might add is that cx ^ cx->link.next won't give you many bits if they're close to each other.

I take that back. This patch wants the seed in the context. So its just a simple re-basing.

Seriously lame that it took so long. Sorry. Jonathan, if you need this for any of the product branches, could you twiddle the flags and request approval accordingly? Otherwise this will flow into m-c with the next TM merge.

No sweat - let's see whether nightly testers uncover any excitement - feels pretty safe to take on branch, but I'm not clamoring for it yet, either. I'll tweak the flag anyhow, so that we get to it in the next triage pass.

Assuming this bakes on trunk without incident, it is a minor security fix and I think I understand Andreas to believe it's pretty safe as well.

I don't know yet if third party software use these APIs, but this patch breaks ABI on 1.9.2. On 1.9.1, it also slightly unbreaks ABI from the changes from [bug 511328](/show_bug.cgi?id=511328 "RESOLVED FIXED - TM: make Math.random threadlocal").

Good news, none of the third party software using libmozjs in debian use the js\_LeaveTrace and js\_CanLeaveTrace functions which binary compatibility is broken by this change.

You should probably audit that 3rd-party software to make sure that none of it uses js\_\* (contra JS\_\*), because those aren't API.

Backport for 1.9.0
This is a backport of the Math.random() changes (both [bug 511328](/show_bug.cgi?id=511328 "RESOLVED FIXED - TM: make Math.random threadlocal") and this bug) from 1.9.1.10 on 1.9.0.x. We need that on Debian for our stable users, even though Mozilla dropped support for that branch. This backport seems to work properly, though I haven't tested if it does what it is supposed to (is there a known exploit or testcase, btw?)
Anyways, I'd appreciate some more eyes taking a look at this patch.

Backport for 1.9.0
Since Mike posted the backport here and got reviews, I'm going to go ahead and request approval1.9.0.next on his patch so that we can get it in CVS for future non-MoCo-driven 1.9.0-based security releases.
Ordinarily I'd volunteer to check it in, too, except that AFAIK /js is still a restricted partition in CVS, so if this gets approval, I'll need to ask someone with access to the /js partition and who hasn't forgotten how to use CVS to check the backport in there. :(

Don't think there's much point in taking this on 1.9.0 without its followup, [bug 577512](/show_bug.cgi?id=577512 "RESOLVED FIXED - (more) cross-domain information leakage with Math.random()").

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=456463&action=edit)

Amit Klein of Trusteer reports that our previous fixes for [bug 464071](/show_bug.cgi?id=464071 "RESOLVED FIXED - User tracking via Math.random output and multipart/form-data boundary string") and [bug 475585](/show_bug.cgi?id=475585 "RESOLVED FIXED - Re-seed Math.random() for each window/frame/context") were insufficient and sends the attached paper.
He would like to know "within one (1) week from today, whether you confirm and acknowledge the technical nature of the vulnerabilities described in the attachment. Of course, I'm available for questions/discussions/suggestions at any time. If you need an extension, please let me know in advance."
He may be disclosing this issue in the future at "a security conference, in which case I would ask you to defer your own disclosure to a date as close to the conference as possible."
Abstract
--------
While Mozilla attempted to address the issues of cross domain information leakage (through Math.random) in Firefox 3.6.4 (and above), Firefox 3.5.10 and Firefox 4.0 (alpha and beta), there is still a security vulnerability in the way the isolation is implemented, which enables cross domain leakage. In fact, it may make it easier to attack Firefox in some cases, compared to previous versions.
Additionally, a concerned is raised on the entropy provided in the seed to the Math.random PRNG, which may enable more powerful attacks.

Gah. The patch in [bug 475585](/show_bug.cgi?id=475585 "RESOLVED FIXED - Re-seed Math.random() for each window/frame/context") could really have used a DOM reviewer...
Shouldn't we reseed the rng at the point where we clear the outer window scope during page navigation?

Yes, we should re-seed. And I also have very serious doubts about the severity of this attack. Math.random is a terrible PRNG, its completely underspecified and doesn't give you any guarantees what kind of randomness or entropy you get out of it. It shouldn't be used for anything but casual random number generation in the first place.

bz, we currently have the rng state in cx, but really it should be in the scope actually (global object). I can clear the cx the clear scope request comes in on, but thats conceptually not guaranteed to be the right one (its in our embedding I am pretty sure though).

> but really it should be in the scope actually
Conceptually, yes.
If there is api to reseed the rng, we could just call that in the DOM code...

Attached is a patch that re-seeds when the scope is cleared. Should we seed from /dev/random? I initialize libc's prng and seed with that, but stacking prngs is usually a bad idea.Assignee: general → gal

Please make this compile on Windows. As discussed, the seeding is a side-show; might not be worth worrying about.
