How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug(s)  :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leak.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-2963

    Kees Cook discovered an issue in the v4l 32-bit compatibility layer for
    64-bit systems that allows local users with /dev/video write permission to
    overwrite arbitrary kernel memory, potentially leading to a privilege
    escalation. On Debian systems, access to /dev/video devices is restricted to
    members of the 'video' group by default.

CVE-2010-3067

    Tavis Ormandy discovered an issue in the io_submit system call. Local users
    can cause an integer overflow resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-3296

    unprivileged users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3297

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the eql network driver that allows
    local users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3310

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the ROSE socket implementation. On
    systems with a rose device, local users can cause a denial of service
    (kernel memory corruption).

CVE-2010-3432

    Thomas Dreibholz discovered an issue in the SCTP protocol that permits a
    remote user to cause a denial of service (kernel panic).

CVE-2010-3437

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the pktcdvd driver. Local users with
    permission to open /dev/pktcdvd/control can obtain the contents of sensitive
    kernel memory or cause a denial of service. By default on Debian systems,
    this access is restricted to members of the group 'cdrom'.

CVE-2010-3442

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the ALSA sound system. Local users with
    permission to open /dev/snd/controlC0 can create an integer overflow
    condition that causes a denial of service. By default on Debian systems,
    this access is restricted to members of the group 'audio'.

CVE-2010-3448

    Dan Jacobson reported an issue in the thinkpad-acpi driver. On certain
    Thinkpad systems, local users can cause a denial of service (X.org crash) by
    reading /proc/acpi/ibm/video.

CVE-2010-3477

    Jeff Mahoney discovered an issue in the Traffic Policing (act_police) module
    that allows local users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3705

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the HMAC processing code in the SCTP
    protocol that allows remote users to create a denial of service (memory
    corruption).

CVE-2010-3848

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    cause a stack overflow condition with large msg->msgiovlen values that can
    result in a denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2010-3849

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    cause a denial of service (oops) if a NULL remote addr value is passed as a
    parameter to sendmsg().

CVE-2010-3850

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    assign econet addresses to arbitrary interfaces due to a missing
    capabilities check.

CVE-2010-3858

    Brad Spengler reported an issue in the setup_arg_pages() function. Due to a
    bounds-checking failure, local users can create a denial of service (kernel
    oops).

CVE-2010-3859

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the TIPC protocol. When the tipc module
    is loaded, local users can gain elevated privileges via the sendmsg() system
    call.

CVE-2010-3873

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the X.25 network protocol. Local users
    can cause heap corruption, resulting in a denial of service (kernel panic).

CVE-2010-3874

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the Control Area Network (CAN)
    subsystem on 64-bit systems. Local users may be able to cause a denial of
    service (heap corruption).

CVE-2010-3875

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the AX.25 protocol. Local users can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3876

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Packet protocol. Local users can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3877

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the TIPC protocol. Local users can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3880

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the INET_DIAG subsystem. Local users
    can cause the kernel to execute unaudited INET_DIAG bytecode, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2010-4072

    Kees Cook discovered an issue in the System V shared memory subsystem.
    Local users can obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-4073

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the System V shared memory subsystem.
    Local users on 64-bit system can obtain the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory via the 32-bit compatible semctl() system call.

CVE-2010-4074

    Dan Rosenberg reported issues in the mos7720 and mos7840 drivers for USB
    serial converter devices. Local users with access to these devices can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-4078

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the framebuffer driver for SiS graphics
    chipesets (sisfb). Local users with access to the framebuffer device can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory via the FBIOGET_VBLANK ioctl.

CVE-2010-4079

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the ivtvfb driver used for the Hauppauge
    PVR-350 card. Local users with access to the framebuffer device can obtain
    the contents of sensitive kernel memory via the FBIOGET_VBLANK ioctl.

CVE-2010-4080

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the ALSA driver for RME Hammerfall DSP
    audio devices. Local users with access to the audio device can obtain the
    contents of sensitive kernel memory via the SNDRV_HDSP_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG_INFO
    ioctl.

CVE-2010-4081

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the ALSA driver for RME Hammerfall DSP
    MADI audio devices. Local users with access to the audio device can obtain
    the contents of sensitive kernel memory via the
    SNDRV_HDSP_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG_INFO ioctl.

CVE-2010-4083

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the semctl system call. Local users can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory through usage of the semid_ds
    structure.

CVE-2010-4164

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the X.25 network protocol. Remote users
    can achieve a denial of service (infinite loop) by taking advantage of an
    integer underflow in the facility parsing code.

Structure sockaddr_tipc is copied to userland with padding bytes after
"id" field in union field "name" unitialized.  It leads to leaking of
contents of kernel stack memory.  We have to initialize them to zero.

Subject: CVE request: kernel stack infoleaks

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered three kernel stack infoleaks in various
packet families of the net subsystem:

===========================================================

net/ax25

Sometimes ax25_getname() doesn't initialize all members of
fsa_digipeater field of fsa struct.  This structure is then copied to
userland.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack memory.  We
have to initialize them to zero.

<http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=128854507120898&w=2>

===========================================================

net/packet

packet_getname_spkt() doesn't initialize all members of sa_data field of
sockaddr struct if strlen(dev->name) < 13.  This structure is then
copied to userland.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack
memory.  We have to fully fill sa_data with strncpy() instead of
strlcpy().

<http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=128854507220908&w=2>

===========================================================

net/tipc

Structure sockaddr_tipc is copied to userland with padding bytes after
"id" field in union field "name" unitialized.  It leads to leaking of
contents of kernel stack memory.  We have to initialize them to zero.

<http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=128854507420917&w=2>

===========================================================

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=649717#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-11-04 12:10:33 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Structure sockaddr_tipc is copied to userland with padding bytes after "id" field in union field "name" unitialized.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack memory.  We have to initialize them to zero.  Reference: <http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=128854507420917&w=2> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2010/q4/94>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=649717#c2)  Petr Matousek    2010-11-04 18:49:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include support for Transparent Inter-Process Communication Protocol (TIPC). A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=649717#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-11-22 13:23:35 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/88f8a5e3e7defccd3925cabb1ee4d3994e5cdb52>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=649717#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-01-13 21:59:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0017 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0017.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=649717#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-01-14 09:03:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0017 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0017.html>   ``` |  |
