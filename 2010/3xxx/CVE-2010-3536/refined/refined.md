Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple vulnerabilities exist across various Oracle products and components. Specific details for each vulnerability are not provided in this document, but the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory referenced in the document likely contains such information. A specific vulnerability in the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control is highlighted, which allows for remote attacks through a crafted HTML file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple vulnerabilities leading to:
    * Remote execution of arbitrary code
    * Information disclosure
    * Denial of service
    * Specifically, a memory initialization vulnerability in the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control is mentioned.

**Impact of exploitation**:
   *  Execution of arbitrary code or commands
    * Information disclosure, potentially leading to access to sensitive information
    * Denial of service
    * An attacker compromising an Oracle database could access sensitive information.

**Attack vectors**:
