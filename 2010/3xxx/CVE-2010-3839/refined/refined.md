  "guidelines_followed": true,
  "relevance": "related",
  "information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a regression introduced by a fix for bug #33811, which caused an infinite loop when handling nested JOIN queries within stored procedures and prepared statements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of nested JOIN queries",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition where the MySQL server hangs, consumes excessive CPU resources (95-100%), and becomes unresponsive.  It also becomes difficult to restart the server without manually killing the mysqld process.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by executing a specially crafted query with nested JOINs within a stored procedure or prepared statement.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user able to execute stored procedures or prepared statements.",
    "additional_details": "The issue occurs when a stored procedure or prepared statement containing a nested JOIN query is called multiple times in a row. The vulnerability affects MySQL versions 5.0.74, 5.1.31 and later (up to 5.1.51, 5.5.6). It is triggered during the query optimization process, specifically in the `find_field_in_table` function during the setup of the group clause."
