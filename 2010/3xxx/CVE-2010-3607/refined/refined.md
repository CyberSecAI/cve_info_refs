*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's file system. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure or remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker manipulates the "folder" and "action" parameters in the "AGENTS/index.php" URL.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities are mentioned beyond being able to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional LFI Vulnerability Mentioned in another product:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input passed via the "lng" parameter in "ADMIN/login.php" of "WebSiteAdmin v2.1".
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's file system. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure or remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker manipulates the "lng" parameter in the "ADMIN/login.php" URL.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities are mentioned beyond being able to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
