Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-3668:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user input within the "jumpurl" feature of TYPO3's secure download mechanism. This flaw allows an attacker to inject malicious headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Header Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a header injection flaw. By manipulating user-provided input, an attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the HTTP response. This could be used to spoof content types, potentially leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Content Spoofing:** An attacker could spoof the MIME type of the download, which might lead to the file being treated as a different type than intended.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While the primary flaw is header injection, the injected headers could be crafted in such a way that could allow for XSS attacks, depending on other factors. This would be possible if the spoofed content-type is used to serve the file as HTML which will execute any injected scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based, targeting the "jumpurl" feature of TYPO3.
*   An attacker would need to manipulate the URL parameters passed to the jumpurl function/script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require any privileges in most cases.
*   They would need to be able to construct a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint to exploit the header injection, using a crafted URL or through a crafted form submission.
*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and endpoint.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**
*   The severity of the vulnerability is somewhat mitigated by changes in PHP, where newer versions no longer allow multiple headers in a single `header()` call. This limits the impact to only MIME-type spoofing and prevents full header injection.
*   The vulnerability affects TYPO3 versions before 4.1.14, 4.2.x before 4.2.13, 4.3.x before 4.3.4 and 4.4.x before 4.4.1.
* Patches have been made available in newer versions to address the vulnerability
