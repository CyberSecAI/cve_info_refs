      "root_cause": "The MySQL server did not properly check for SQL errors during a `LOAD DATA INFILE` operation, resulting in an incorrect OK packet being sent even when errors occurred. Additionally, an overly strict assertion on the server-side protocol checking in debug builds was causing crashes.",

It highlights both the improper error handling within the `LOAD DATA INFILE` process and the issue of a overly strict assertion causing crashes in debug builds.
