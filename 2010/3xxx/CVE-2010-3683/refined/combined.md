How to repeat:

# --send is important

CREATE TABLE test.t_load (id INT NOT NULL);
--send LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'tb.txt' INTO TABLE test.t_load

#<EOF>

      [Bug #52512](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52512): Assertion `! is_set()' in Diagnostics_area::set_ok_status
      on LOAD DATA

      Two problems :
      1. LOAD DATA was not checking for SQL errors and was sending an OK
      packet even when there were errors reported already. Fixed to check for
      SQL errors in addition to the error conditions already detected.
      2. There was an over-ambitious assert() on the server to check if the
      protocol is always followed by the client. This can cause crashes on
      debug servers by clients not completing the protocol exchange for some
      reason (e.g. --send command in mysqltest). Fixed by keeping the assert
      only on client side, since the server always completes the protocol
      exchange.

Noted in 5.1.49, 5.5.5 changelogs.

LOAD DATA INFILE did not check for SQL errors and sent an OK packet
even when errors were already reported. Also, an assert related to
client-server protocol checking in debug servers sometimes was raised
when it should not have been.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: CVE Request -- MySQL v5.1.49 -- multiple DoS
 flaws

Sorry for the delay...

There are several issues of the same bug type, but based solely on the
"Version" field in the associated MySQL bug IDs, it appears that each
issue has a different set of affected (fixed?) versions.  So these all
wind up being SPLIT from each other.

> 1, Security Fix: After changing the values of the innodb_file_format or
>                 innodb_file_per_table configuration parameters, DDL
> statements
>                 could cause a server crash. (Bug#55039)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=55039>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628660>
>   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.

CVE-2010-3676

> 2, Security Fix: Joins involving a table with a unique SET column could cause
>                 a server crash. (Bug#54575)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54575>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628040>
>   Reason:       NULL pointer dereference leading to (temporary) server DoS.

CVE-2010-3677

> 3, Security Fix: Incorrect handling of NULL arguments could lead to a crash
>                 for IN() or CASE operations when NULL arguments were either
>                 passed explicitly as arguments (for IN()) or implicitly
>                 generated by the WITH ROLLUP  modifier (for IN() and CASE).
>                 (Bug#54477)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54477>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628172>
>   Reason:       NULL pointer dereference leading to (temporary) server DoS.

CVE-2010-3678

> 4, Security Fix: A malformed argument to the BINLOG statement could result
>                 in Valgrind warnings or a server crash. (Bug#54393)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54393>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628062>
>   Reason:       Use of unassigned memory leading to (temporary) server DoS
> (crash).

CVE-2010-3679

> 5, Security Fix: Use of TEMPORARY  InnoDB tables with nullable columns could
> cause
>                 a server crash. (Bug#54044)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54044>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628192>
>   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.

CVE-2010-3680

> 6, Security Fix: The server could crash if there were alternate reads from
>                 two indexes on a table using the HANDLER interface.
> (Bug#54007)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54007>

CVE-2010-3681

> 7, Security Fix: Using EXPLAIN with queries of the form SELECT ... UNION
>                 ... ORDER BY (SELECT ... WHERE ...) could cause a server
>                 crash. (Bug#52711)

>   Reason:       NULL pointer dereference leading to (temporary) server DoS.

CVE-2010-3682

> 8, Security Fix: LOAD DATA INFILE did not check for SQL errors and sent an
>                 OK packet even when errors were already reported. Also, an
>                 assert related to client-server protocol checking in debug
>                 servers sometimes was raised when it should not have been.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- mysql
- local users could delete data files for tables of other users
(CVE-2010-1626).
- authenticated users could gather information for tables they
should not have access to (CVE-2010-1849)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-3683,
CVE-2010-3681, CVE-2010-1848)
- authenticated users could bypass intended access restrictions
(CVE-2008-7247, CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1,
openSUSE 11.2
- dhcp
ISC DHCP can be crashed with a single dhcpv6 packet.
CVE-2010-3611 has been assigned to this issue.
Additionally a dhcrelay crash when receiving packets on interfaces
without assigned IPv4 address has been fixed as well as an infinite
loop in dhcpd.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- monotone
Remote attackers could crash a monotone server via an empty argument to
the 'mtn' command (CVE-2010-4098).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moodle
This update of moodle fixes:
- CVE-2010-4207: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
charts/assets/charts.swf.
- CVE-2010-4208: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
uploader/assets/uploader.swf.
- CVE-2010-4209: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
swfstore/swfstore.swf.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- openssl/libopenssl-devel
Specially crafted responses from SSL servers could cause a double-free bug
in openssl's client implementation. Therefore a malicious SSL servers could
crash client-side code that uses the openssl library for its SSL connection.
(CVE-2010-2939: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM))
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
