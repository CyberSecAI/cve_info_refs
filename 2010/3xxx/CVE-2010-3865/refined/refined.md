{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) subsystem during page counting for RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper calculation of the total number of pages needed for RDMA operations. The code uses an 'unsigned int' to store the total page count, but it is possible to cause it to overflow due to a large number of iovec entries or large iovec sizes.",
       "The vulnerability exists in the rds_rdma_pages function in net/rds/rdma.c, where it does not use the regular iovec code but constructs its own, which is more susceptible to overflow."
    ],
    "impact": "Local attackers can potentially gain kernel privileges due to the integer overflow when allocating memory for RDMA operations. This could lead to a crash, privilege escalation, or other undefined behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local user can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted message via RDS sockets that contains a large number of iovec entries or large iovec sizes.",
      "The attacker must have the ability to create and send messages through RDS."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A local user with the ability to send messages using RDS sockets.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was introduced in commit eff5f53bef75c0864a5da06bb688939092b848dc (v2.6.30-rc1). The vulnerability is fixed by checking if tot_pages goes negative during accumulation."
