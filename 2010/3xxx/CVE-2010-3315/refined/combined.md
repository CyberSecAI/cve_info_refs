How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

authz.c in the mod\_dav\_svn module for the Apache HTTP Server, as distributed in Apache Subversion 1.5.x before 1.5.8 and 1.6.x before 1.6.13, when SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit is enabled, does not properly handle a named repository as a rule scope, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via svn commands.

Package        : subversion
Vulnerability  : logic flaw
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : none
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3315

Kamesh Jayachandran and C. Michael Pilat discovered that the mod_dav_svn
module of subversion, a version control system, is not properly enforcing
access rules which are scope-limited to named repositories.  If the
SVNPathAuthz option is set to "short_circuit" set this may enable an
unprivileged attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and disclose
or modify repository content.

As a workaround it is also possible to set SVNPathAuthz to "on" but be
advised that this can result in a performance decrease for large
repositories.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1dfsg1-5.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.12dfsg-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.12dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- clamav
clamav was updated to version 0.96.5 to fix denial of service
problems (CVE-2010-4479, CVE-2010-4260, CVE-2010-4261)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- subversion
The SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit option allowed remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2010-3315).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- python
a race condition in the accept() implementation of smtpd.py could
lead to a denial of service (CVE-2010-3493).
integer overflows and insufficient size checks could crash the
audioop module (CVE-2010-2089, CVE-2010-1634).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit that to
modify or forge messages (CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020,
CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS version 2.4.9 fixes among other things two cross-site-scripting
and a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2010-2080, CVE-2010-3476,
CVE-2010-4071).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moonlight
Untrusted Moonlight apps could bypass constraints on methods which
potentially allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-4254).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.3
- OpenOffice\_org
Specially crafted ppt files could cause a heap based buffer overflow
in OpenOffice\_org Impress. Attackers could exploit that to crash
OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936).
The update also fixes numerous non-security bugs. Please refer to
the package changelog for details.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

=== Content from subversion.apache.org_bf955f73_20250124_123218.html ===
 Subversion servers up to 1.6.12 (inclusive) making use of the
"SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit" mod\_dav\_svn configuration setting have
a bug which may allow users to write and/or read portions of the
repository to which they are not intended to have access.
Summary:
========
Subversion's WebDAV server module, mod\_dav\_svn, can interact with
the Apache HTTP Server and related modules in a variety of ways to
implement various authentication and authorization policies for
Subversion repositories hosted via that service. One such way
involves setting the value of the mod\_dav\_svn configuration
directive SVNPathAuthz to "short\_circuit", a non-default value which
causes mod\_dav\_svn to bypass Apache's internal authorization
subsystem and to instead query Subversion's built-in authorization
logic directly. Unfortunately, a bug in the implementation of this
feature (which exists for the purpose of improving the performance
of Subversion's authorization checks) causes it to ignore access
rules which are scope-limited to named repositories. Depending on
the configuration of the access file which Subversion consults to
determine the repository's access policy, this can have the effect
of inadvertently exposing more (or less) information to a user than
intended.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion servers 1.5.0 through 1.5.7 (inclusive)
Subversion servers 1.6.0 through 1.6.12 (inclusive)
Known fixed:
============
Subversion 1.6.13
Subversion 1.5.8
Details:
========
Assume that there exists an Apache-hosted Subversion service,
configured to require valid authentication of all users, and
employing the following access configuration file for the purpose of
authorizing access to specific portions of hosted repositories:
# All users have read permission on all repositories in their
# entirety unless otherwise noted.
[/]
\* = r
# Hide the '/pokernight' directory of the 'office' repository
# from the Boss Man (pointy).
[office:/pokernight]
pointy =
Now assume that the user "pointy" is attempting to browse or
checkout the root of the "office" repository.
By default (or when the SVNPathAuthz directive is set to "on" in the
Apache configuration), Subversion will notice both of the rulesets
in the previous configuration file -- the first of which applies to
all repositories configured to use this access file to govern
authorization, the second of which applies only to the repository
named "office". In such a situation, when the user "pointy"
attempts to access the "office" repository, Subversion will grant
him or her access to the root of the repository (per the first
ruleset), but then deny access to the '/pokernight' top-level
subdirectory (per the second ruleset).
These access determinations happen because Subversion constructs and
issues Apache subrequests to test the access privileges for each and
every item in the repository that it considers exposing to the user
"pointy". If any module in the Apache authorization stack denies
access to a given path checked in this fashion, that path and its
contents are hidden from "pointy".
This can be a somewhat expensive operation to perform though, so
Subversion administrators who know that the only item in the Apache
authorization stack for their Subversion repository locations is
Subversion itself may set "SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit" in their
Apache configuration. This setting causes Subversion to avoid the
Apache subrequest framework altogether and instead query its own
access rules directly. Unfortunately, for servers affected by the
bug described herein, Subversion would ignore the second ruleset in
the previous example because it has a repository prefix on it -- the
"office:" portion of the section's name. The result would be that
the read access granted to "pointy" at the root of the repository
would not be overridden for the '/pokernight' subtree, and user
"pointy" would indeed be able to view that subtree and its
contents. Poker night at the office would be cancelled. Or worse,
the Boss Man would want to join in, too.
Because the same mechanisms are used to govern write permissions,
too, this bug could also permit users to write to repository areas
that they shouldn't be allowed to write to.
Because the same mechanism can be used to grant additional
permissions (not merely take them away), this bug could also
disallow a user's access to portions of the repository that he or
she should be allowed to access.
Finally, because Subversion determines access rights for a
revision's metadata (log messages, author names, etc.) based on the
user's rights to the various files and directories modified in that
revision, this bug could grant improper write and/or read access to
revision metadata, too.
Severity:
=========
Medium. An affected server with a particular configuration could
leak versioned file contents and metadata, directory metadata, and
revision metadata to underprivileged remote users or user classes.
Underprivileged remote users could modify repository contents, too,
though in the case of file and directory information, no lossage
could occur. (Subversion is, after all, a version control system.)
Revision metadata could be silently modified or destroyed, depending
on whether the repository was configured to notify users about
changes to that information or otherwise keep external records of
those changes.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend that all users who employ the "SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit"
configuration directive upgrade to Subversion 1.6.13 immediately.
Those who are unable or unwilling to upgrade at this time should
consider one or more of the following workarounds:
1. Change the SVNPathAuthz configuration directive's value to "on".
This may negatively affect the performance of your Subversion
service, but will avoid the problematic logic. You might need
to double-check the rest of your configuration to ensure that
taking this step will not inadvertently cause your Subversion
authorization checks to pass through extra authorization modules
which have thus far been effectively bypassed.
2. Refactor your access files and surrounding Apache configuration
so that a given file's rules apply only to a single repository,
and then remove any and all repository prefixes from those files.
This will allow Subversion's rule matching logic to correctly
find all the sections which apply to each repository. Using the
previous example, this would mean creating an access file which
governs authorization for the "office" repository only:
# All users have read permission on this repository in its
# entirety unless otherwise noted.
[/]
\* = r
# Hide the '/pokernight' directory of the 'office' repository
# from the Boss Man (pointy).
[/pokernight]
pointy =
...and also creating similar files for each additional
repository previous governed by the original access file.

## Details

It was discovered that Subversion incorrectly handled certain 'partial

access' privileges in rare scenarios. Remote authenticated users could use

this flaw to obtain sensitive information (revision properties). This issue

only applied to Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. ([CVE-2007-2448](/security/CVE-2007-2448))

It was discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for Apache did not

properly handle a named repository as a rule scope. Remote authenticated

users could use this flaw to bypass intended restrictions. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04 LTS, and 10.10. ([CVE-2010-3315](/security/CVE-2010-3315))

It was discovered that the Subversion mod\_dav\_svn module for Apache

incorrectly handled the walk function. Remote authenticated users could use

this flaw to cause the service to crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2010-4539](/security/CVE-2010-4539))

It was discovered that Subversion incorrectly handled certain memory

operations. Remote authenticated users could use this flaw to consume large

quantities of memory and cause the service to crash, leading to a denial of

service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04 LTS, and 10.10.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

authz.c in the mod\_dav\_svn module for the Apache HTTP Server, as
distributed in Apache Subversion 1.5.x before 1.5.8 and 1.6.x before
1.6.13, when SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit is enabled, does not properly
handle a named repository as a rule scope, which allows remote
authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via svn
commands.

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

looks like this was introduced here:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=865065
code in dapper and hardy doesn't look affected
karmic+ binary is in universe, so adding appropriate tag.

# CVE-2010-3315

| **Name** | CVE-2010-3315 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | authz.c in the mod\_dav\_svn module for the Apache HTTP Server, as distributed in Apache Subversion 1.5.x before 1.5.8 and 1.6.x before 1.6.13, when SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit is enabled, does not properly handle a named repository as a rule scope, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via svn commands. |
