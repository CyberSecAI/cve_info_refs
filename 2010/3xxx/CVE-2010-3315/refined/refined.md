Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-3315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `authz.c` module of the `mod_dav_svn` component in Apache Subversion. Specifically, when the `SVNPathAuthz` directive is set to `short_circuit` (a non-default configuration), the module doesn't correctly handle access rules that are scoped to named repositories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect access control**: The `mod_dav_svn` module bypasses Apache's internal authorization subsystem, leading to direct access rule queries via its own logic. This logic incorrectly ignores access rules that specify a repository name as a scope.
*   **Bypass of access restrictions**: The incorrect handling of named repository scopes allows remote, authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions defined in the access control configuration files. This leads to unintended information disclosure, data modification, and potential denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized read access**: Attackers may be able to read content from repositories or parts of repositories they are not authorized to access.
*   **Unauthorized write access**: Attackers may be able to modify repository content in locations they are not authorized to write.
*   **Metadata exposure**: Attackers may gain unauthorized access to or modify a revision's metadata (log messages, author names) because access rights for metadata are linked to the user's file/directory access rights.
*   **Potential Denial of Service (DoS)**: In certain cases, the vulnerability could lead to a crash of the Subversion service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** Exploitation can occur remotely if a vulnerable Subversion server is exposed over the network.
*   **Authenticated users:** Exploitation requires an attacker to have valid authentication credentials.
*   **`svn` commands**: The vulnerability is triggered by standard `svn` commands used to access the repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid credentials:** The attacker must possess valid credentials for the Subversion service being exploited.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Subversion server.
*   **`SVNPathAuthz short_circuit` configuration:** The target Subversion server must have the `SVNPathAuthz` directive set to `short_circuit` in its configuration, which is not the default setting.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Subversion servers version 1.5.x before 1.5.8 and 1.6.x before 1.6.13.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Kamesh Jayachandran and C. Michael Pilat, both from CollabNet, Inc.
*   Upstream fixes are available in Subversion 1.5.8 and 1.6.13.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as having a 'Medium' severity.

**Workarounds:**

Users who cannot immediately upgrade were advised to consider these workarounds:

1.  Change the `SVNPathAuthz` setting from `short_circuit` to `on`. This might impact performance, but avoids the vulnerability.
2.  Restructure access files and Apache configuration so that access rules apply to only one repository, and remove any repository prefixes from the rule sets.

This information is primarily derived from the detailed description provided in the `subversion.apache.org` content, along with corroborating details from other sources. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry and Debian Security Advisory also provide useful background and confirmation.
