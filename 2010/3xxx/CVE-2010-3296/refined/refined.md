  "CVE-2010-3296": {
    "description": "The CHELSIO_GET_QSET_NUM device ioctl in the cxgb3 driver in the Linux kernel allows local users to read 4 bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the \"addr\" member of the ch_reg struct declared on the stack in cxgb_extension_ioctl() is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user.",
    "affected_products": [
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time 11 SP1",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 11",
      "SLE 11 SERVER Unsupported Extras",

      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `addr` member of the `ch_reg` struct, located on the stack within the `cxgb_extension_ioctl` function, is not initialized or zeroed before being copied back to the user. This results in a leak of uninitialized stack memory.",

        "Information Exposure",
        "Uninitialized Memory"

      "impact": "Local users can read 4 bytes of uninitialized kernel stack memory, which could potentially expose sensitive information. This information leak could be leveraged to exploit other vulnerabilities.",

      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged user with the ability to execute the `CHELSIO_GET_QSET_NUM` ioctl on a cxgb3 network interface device is required to trigger this vulnerability."
