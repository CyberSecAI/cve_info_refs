```
Structures kvm_vcpu_events, kvm_debugregs, kvm_pit_state2 and
kvm_clock_data are copied to userland with some padding and reserved
fields unitialized.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack
memory.  We have to initialize them to zero.

In patch v1 Jan Kiszka suggested to fill reserved fields with zeros
instead of memset'ting the whole struct.  It makes sense as these
fields are explicitly marked as padding.  No more fields need zeroing.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update to the SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP 1 Realtime Extension
kernel brings various bug and lots of security fixes.
This update also integrates upstream 2.6.33.7-rt29->2.6.33.7.2-rt30
changes.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-2962: Missing sanity checks in pread/pwrite in the i915
graphics driver allowed local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and
so gain privileges. This required a i915 graphics card to be effective.
CVE-2010-3310: Multiple integer signedness errors in net/rose/af\_rose.c
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a rose\_getname function call, related to the rose\_bind and
rose\_connect functions.
CVE-2010-3080: A double free in an alsa error path was fixed, which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-3081: Incorrect buffer handling in the biarch-compat buffer
handling could be used by local attackers to gain root privileges. This
problem affects foremost x86\_64, or potentially other biarch platforms,
like PowerPC and S390x.
CVE-2010-2960: The keyctl\_session\_to\_parent function in
security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel expects that a certain
parent session keyring exists, which allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a KEYCTL\_SESSION\_TO\_PARENT
argument to the keyctl function.
CVE-2010-3084: A buffer overflow in the ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL code
could be used to crash the kernel or potentially execute code.
CVE-2010-2955: A kernel information leak via the WEXT ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-3301: Mismatch between 32bit and 64bit register usage in the
system call entry path could be used by local attackers to gain root
privileges. This problem only affects x86\_64 kernels.
CVE-2010-3298: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/usb/hso driver.
CVE-2010-3296: Fixed a kernel information leak in the cxgb3 driver.
CVE-2010-3297: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/eql driver.
CVE-2010-3078: Fixed a kernel information leak in the xfs filesystem.
CVE-2010-3079: Fixed a ftrace NULL pointer dereference problem which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-2954: The irda\_bind function in net/irda/af\_irda.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle failure of the irda\_open\_tsap
function, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified
other impact via multiple unsuccessful calls to bind on an AF\_IRDA
(aka PF\_IRDA) socket.
CVE-2010-2959: Integer overflow in net/can/bcm.c in the Controller
Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel allowed attackers
to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (system crash)
via crafted CAN traffic.
CVE-2010-2946: The 'os2' xattr namespace on the jfs filesystem could
be used to bypass xattr namespace rules.

2) Solution or Work-Around
Please install the updated packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=656984#c4) states that the fixes are there. Are there more?  I checked the 5.5.z git tree and no changes had been ported.  I haven't worked with z-stream before so I'm not 100% familiar with the process.  Now I can't access git at all.  [zamsden@mysore rhel5.5.z]$ git pull fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly  On second thought, perhaps I'm a bit confused.  The changes would be to the KVM module, which isn't part of the 5.5.z git tree.  In fact, I don't know where the KVM tree corresponding to 5.5.z lives.  Is there a kvm-rhel5.5.z.git tree to which these should be ported?  Also, there were two patches, the first required a correction.  Perhaps one of them is missing.  I'll check as soon as git access is restored.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=656984#c13)  Zachary Amsden    2010-12-15 15:45:00 UTC  ``` Okay, it looks as though the kvm-rhel5.5.z kmod is built from the branch rhel55/next in the kvm-rhel5 git tree, and that Eduardo just pulled the second fix into that branch.  All should be well now.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=656984#c14)  juzhang    2010-12-16 03:09:16 UTC  ``` Verified on kvm-83-164.el5_5.30,passed.  ---snip of output---  crash> px ((struct vcpu_svm *)0xffff81011e19c040)->vcpu.arch.host_tsc $6 = 0x1ef3ea5660f29 crash> px ((struct vcpu_svm *)0xffff81011e19c040)->vmcb.control.tsc_offset $7 = 0xfffe10c16374676f crash> px 0-0xfffe10c16374676f $8 = 0x1ef3e9c8b9891 crash> pd 0x1ef3ea5660f29-0x1ef3e9c8b9891 $9 = 148534936  The difference between host TSC and guest TSC offset               is only 148534936 cycles.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=656984#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-12-20 17:37:20 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=649920#c0)  Petr Matousek    2010-11-04 19:59:06 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Structures kvm_vcpu_events, kvm_debugregs, kvm_pit_state2 and kvm_clock_data are copied to userland with some padding and reserved fields unitialized.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack memory.  Reference: <http://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg44130.html> <http://git.kernel.org/?p=virt/kvm/kvm.git;a=commit;h=831d9d02f9522e739825a51a11e3bc5aa531a905>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=649920#c1)  Petr Matousek    2010-11-04 20:00:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include support for Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=649920#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-11-22 13:25:03 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/97e69aa62f8b5d338d6cff49be09e37cc1262838>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=649920#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-12-20 17:36:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0998 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0998.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=649920#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-21 23:53:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0.Z - Server Only  Via RHSA-2011:0883 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0883.html>   ``` |  |

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 kernel was updated to
2.6.32.27 and fixes various bugs and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address
in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with
other issues.
CVE-2010-4160: An overflow in sendto() and recvfrom() routines was
fixed that could be used by local attackers to potentially crash the
kernel using some socket families like L2TP.
CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth\_ioctl\_alloc
could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.
CVE-2010-4165: The do\_tcp\_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP\_MAXSEG (aka MSS)
values, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a
divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer.
CVE-2010-4164: A remote (or local) attacker communicating over X.25
could cause a kernel panic by attempting to negotiate malformed
facilities.
CVE-2010-4175: A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the
RDS protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is
considered not to be exploitable.
CVE-2010-4169: Use-after-free vulnerability in mm/mprotect.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service via
vectors involving an mprotect system call.
CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module
was fixed. Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not
exploitable.
CVE-2010-4158: A memory information leak in Berkeley packet filter
rules allowed local attackers to read uninitialized memory of the
kernel stack.
CVE-2010-4162: A local denial of service in the blockdevice layer
was fixed.
CVE-2010-4163: By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length,
a local user could have caused a kernel panic.
CVE-2010-3861: The ethtool\_get\_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory,
which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information
via an ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule\_cnt
value.
CVE-2010-3881: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structure members, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via read operations on the /dev/kvm device.
CVE-2010-3437: A range checking overflow in pktcdvd ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-4082: The viafb\_ioctl\_get\_viafb\_info function in
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a VIAFB\_GET\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## Topic

Updated kvm packages that fix one security issue and three bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

It was found that some structure padding and reserved fields in certain
data structures in QEMU-KVM were not initialized properly before being
copied to user-space. A privileged host user with access to "/dev/kvm"
could use this flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space.
(CVE-2010-3881)

Red Hat would like to thank Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting this issue.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The 'kvm\_amd' kernel module did not initialize the TSC (Time Stamp

Counter) offset in the VMCB (Virtual Machine Control Block) correctly.
After a vCPU (virtual CPU) has been created, the TSC offset in the VMCB
should have a negative value so that the virtual machine will see TSC
values starting at zero. However, the TSC offset was set to zero and
therefore the virtual machine saw the same TSC value as the host. With this
update, the TSC offset has been updated to show the correct values.
(BZ#656984)

* Setting the boot settings of a virtual machine to, firstly, boot from PXE

and, secondly, to boot from the hard drive would result in a PXE boot loop,
that is, the virtual machine would not continue to boot from the hard drive
if the PXE boot failed. This was caused by a flaw in the 'bochs-bios' (part
of KVM) code. With this update, after a virtual machine tries to boot from
PXE and fails, it continues to boot from a hard drive if there is one
present. (BZ#659850)

* If a 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 virtual machine was migrated to

another host with a different CPU clock speed, the clock of that virtual
machine would consistently lose or gain time (approximately half a second
for every second the host is running). On machines that do not use the kvm
clock, the network time protocol daemon (ntpd) could correct the time
drifts caused by migration. However, using the pvclock caused the time to
change consistently. This was due to flaws in the save/load functions of
pvclock. With this update, the issue has been fixed and migrating a virtual
machine no longer causes time drift. (BZ#660239)

All KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in the
Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

The following procedure must be performed before this update will take
effect:

1) Stop all KVM guest virtual machines.

2) Either reboot the hypervisor machine or, as the root user, remove (using
"modprobe -r [module]") and reload (using "modprobe [module]") all of the
following modules which are currently running (determined using "lsmod"):
kvm, ksm, kvm-intel or kvm-amd.

3) Restart the KVM guest virtual machines.
