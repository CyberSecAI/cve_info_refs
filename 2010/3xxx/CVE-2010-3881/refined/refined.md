  "CVE-2010-3881": {
    "description": "Structures kvm_vcpu_events, kvm_debugregs, kvm_pit_state2 and kvm_clock_data are copied to userland with some padding and reserved fields uninitialized. It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack memory.",
    "root_cause": "The KVM structures `kvm_vcpu_events`, `kvm_debugregs`, `kvm_pit_state2`, and `kvm_clock_data` were copied to userland without proper initialization of padding and reserved fields.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leakage",
      "Uninitialized Data"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel stack memory contents could be leaked to userland, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local Access",
      "Read Operations on /dev/kvm"
