How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description:
When using MySQL 5.1.41, 5.1.44, and the latest SVN version from today (5.1.48), the following crashes...

mysql> SET storage_engine=innodb;

mysql> CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE mk_upgrade AS SELECT  IF(     NULL  IS NOT NULL,      NULL , NULL) ; drop table mk_upgrade;

but when setting the storage engine to MYISAM, it doesn't always crash. Example below.

mysql> SET storage_engine=MYISAM;

mysql> CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE mk_upgrade AS SELECT  IF(     NULL  IS NOT NULL,      NULL , NULL) ; drop table mk_upgrade;

Any ideas?

How to repeat:
mysql> SET storage_engine=MYISAM;

mysql> CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE mk_upgrade AS SELECT  IF(     NULL  IS NOT NULL,      NULL , NULL) ; drop table mk_upgrade;
```

Recent 5.1.48-bzr debug(!) binaries show possible reason of crash. Assertion happens during the very first CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE execution:

Version: '5.1.48-debug'  socket: '/tmp/mysql.sock'  port: 3306  Source distribution
Assertion failed: (0), function unknown function, file handler/ha_innodb.cc, line 3227.

Then, upon server restart, we get these in the error log:

```
the original problem, a crash in

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE mk_upgrade engine=innodb AS SELECT  IF(     NULL  IS NOT NULL,      NULL
, NULL)

is reproducible but looks more of a general problem.
the assert in ha_innodb.cc is on field->type() and the type is 6,
MYSQL_TYPE_NULL. MyISAM happily creates the following table:

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `imk_upgrade` (
  `IF(     NULL  IS NOT NULL,      NULL
, NULL)` null DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

from memory, datatype 'null' is undocumented and it doesn't really make sense
to me. It should be converted to something or rejected at MySQL level.

As for the crash in

create temporary table t1
    ->  (charguid int not null,
    ->   totalexp bigint not null
    ->  ) engine = innodb;

then INSERT, it looks like a separate problem.
I can't reproduce it.
Please file a separate bug for it. We are interested in this case more in mysqld
log before the crash, not the messages shown in recovery.

```

```
We will special handle MYSQL_TYPE_NULL type so that it does not trigger assertion for 5.1. The correct solution to block such column type would be done in the  MySQL layer with [bug #54394](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54394)

create table tmp select coalesce(null,null,null);

set storage_engine=innodb;
drop table if exists tmp;
create table tmp select greatest(null,null);

This is the error message 5.1.49 returns:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-28 14:13:25 UTC  ``` A denial of service was found in the way MySQL processed creation of temporary tables, when the InnoDB storage engine was used. A remote authenticated MySQL user could use this flaw to cause mysqld daemon abort (assertion failure).  References:   [1] <http://secunia.com/advisories/41048/>   [2] <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-49.html>  Upstream bug report:   [3] <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54044>  Note: This issue only causes a temporary denial of service, as the mysql daemon shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will be automatically restarted after the abort.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-28 14:16:09 UTC  ``` Public reproducer (from [3]):  SET storage_engine=innodb; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE mk_upgrade AS SELECT  IF(NULL  IS NOT NULL, NULL , NULL) ; drop table mk_upgrade;   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-28 14:34:36 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the mysql package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.  This issue affects the version of the mysql package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, as exploitation of this issue would mean only a temporary denial of service, since the mysql daemon shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will be automatically restarted after the abort.  A future update may address this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  --  This issue affects the versions of the mysql package, as shipped with Fedora release of 12 and 13.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-31 12:54:52 UTC  ``` CVE Request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/08/30/8>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-09-23 09:19:56 UTC  ``` Created mysql tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 636780](show_bug.cgi?id=636780 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2010-3676 CVE-2010-3677 CVE-2010-3678 CVE-2010-3679 CVE-2010-3680 CVE-2010-3681 CVE-2010-3682 CVE-2010-3683 mysql various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-09-29 08:42:53 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2010-3680](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3680) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-03 20:21:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0825 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0825.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c12)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-03 20:48:36 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of mysql as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=628192#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-01-18 18:43:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0164 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0164.html>   ``` |  |

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3677 CVE-2010-3680 CVE-2010-3681 CVE-2010-3682 CVE-2010-3833 CVE-2010-3834 CVE-2010-3835 CVE-2010-3836 CVE-2010-3837 CVE-2010-3838 CVE-2010-3840

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2010-3677

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) via a join query that uses a
  table with a unique SET column.

CVE-2010-3680

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by creating temporary tables
  while using InnoDB, which triggers an assertion failure.

CVE-2010-3681

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by using the HANDLER interface
  and performing "alternate reads from two indexes on a table," which
  triggers an assertion failure.

CVE-2010-3682

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled use of EXPLAIN with
  certain queries.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3833

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled propagation during
  evaluation of arguments to extreme-value functions.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3834

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled materializing a derived
  table that required a temporary table for grouping.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3835

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain user-variable
  assignment expressions that are evaluated in a logical expression context.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3836

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled pre-evaluation of LIKE
  predicates during view preparation.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3837

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled using GROUP_CONCAT()
  and WITH ROLLUP together.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3838

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain queries using a
  mixed list of numeric and LONGBLOB arguments to the GREATEST() or
  LEAST() functions.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3840

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled improper WKB data
  passed to the PolyFromWKB() function.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.51a-24+lenny5

The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5.0 anymore.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: CVE Request -- MySQL v5.1.49 -- multiple DoS
 flaws

Sorry for the delay...

There are several issues of the same bug type, but based solely on the
"Version" field in the associated MySQL bug IDs, it appears that each
issue has a different set of affected (fixed?) versions.  So these all
wind up being SPLIT from each other.

> 1, Security Fix: After changing the values of the innodb_file_format or
>                 innodb_file_per_table configuration parameters, DDL
> statements
>                 could cause a server crash. (Bug#55039)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=55039>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628660>
>   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.

CVE-2010-3676

> 2, Security Fix: Joins involving a table with a unique SET column could cause
>                 a server crash. (Bug#54575)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54575>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628040>
>   Reason:       NULL pointer dereference leading to (temporary) server DoS.

CVE-2010-3677

> 3, Security Fix: Incorrect handling of NULL arguments could lead to a crash
>                 for IN() or CASE operations when NULL arguments were either
>                 passed explicitly as arguments (for IN()) or implicitly
>                 generated by the WITH ROLLUP  modifier (for IN() and CASE).
>                 (Bug#54477)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54477>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628172>
>   Reason:       NULL pointer dereference leading to (temporary) server DoS.

CVE-2010-3678

> 4, Security Fix: A malformed argument to the BINLOG statement could result
>                 in Valgrind warnings or a server crash. (Bug#54393)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54393>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628062>
>   Reason:       Use of unassigned memory leading to (temporary) server DoS
> (crash).

CVE-2010-3679

> 5, Security Fix: Use of TEMPORARY  InnoDB tables with nullable columns could
> cause
>                 a server crash. (Bug#54044)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54044>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628192>
>   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.

CVE-2010-3680

> 6, Security Fix: The server could crash if there were alternate reads from
>                 two indexes on a table using the HANDLER interface.
> (Bug#54007)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54007>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628680>
>   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.

CVE-2010-3681

> 7, Security Fix: Using EXPLAIN with queries of the form SELECT ... UNION
>                 ... ORDER BY (SELECT ... WHERE ...) could cause a server
>                 crash. (Bug#52711)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52711>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628328>
>   Reason:       NULL pointer dereference leading to (temporary) server DoS.

CVE-2010-3682

> 8, Security Fix: LOAD DATA INFILE did not check for SQL errors and sent an
>                 OK packet even when errors were already reported. Also, an
>                 assert related to client-server protocol checking in debug
>                 servers sometimes was raised when it should not have been.
>                 (Bug#52512)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52512>
>                 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=628698>
>   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.
