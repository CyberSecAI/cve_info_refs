Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3939:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the Windows kernel-mode driver `win32k.sys` due to improper memory allocation when copying data from user mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory allocation leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- This can lead to:
    - Complete control of the affected system.
    - Installation of programs.
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
    - Creation of new accounts with full user rights.
    - Elevation of privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- An attacker must first have valid logon credentials to the system.
- The attacker can then run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log on to the system locally.
- They need the ability to execute a malicious application on the target system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed before the release of the security update.
- Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the security update's release.
- The affected component is the `win32k.sys` driver, which is part of the Windows subsystem and is responsible for window management, screen output, and input collection.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode drivers allocate memory.
- This vulnerability is one of multiple vulnerabilities addressed by the MS10-098 security bulletin, which also includes CVE-2010-3940, CVE-2010-3941, CVE-2010-3942, CVE-2010-3943 and CVE-2010-3944.
