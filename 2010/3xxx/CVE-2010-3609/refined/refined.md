{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the OpenSLP's parsing of malformed extensions within SLP packets. Specifically, the 'next extension offset' in a malformed packet can point to itself or a previous extension, causing the parser to enter an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending a specially crafted SLP packet. This can lead to 100% CPU consumption, disrupting the affected service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network packets",
      "Remote"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required."

    "OpenSLP",
    "VMware ESX/ESXi",
    "Novell, Inc.",
