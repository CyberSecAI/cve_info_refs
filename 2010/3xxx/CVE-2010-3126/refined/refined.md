    "CVE-2010-3126": {
      "root_cause": "DLL hijacking vulnerability in Avast! when parsing license files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application loads a DLL (mfc90loc.dll) from the same directory as the license file, instead of a trusted system location."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. By placing a malicious DLL named 'mfc90loc.dll' in the same directory as a license file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code when Avast! attempts to parse the license.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local. The attacker must place a malicious DLL and an Avast license file in the same directory.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs write access to a directory where the victim might open a license file. They must also be able to create a malicious DLL file with the name 'mfc90loc.dll'."
