Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3711:

**CVE Description:** The Pidgin (libpurple) application is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability stems from the application's improper handling of the return code from the Base64 decoding function. A remote attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted message, causing Pidgin to crash.

**Root Cause:** The root cause is improper handling of the return code from the Base64 decoding function within Pidgin.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** Pidgin fails to properly validate the output/return code of the Base64 decoding operation before further processing.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The lack of sanitization can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, ultimately crashing the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the Pidgin application crashing, leading to a denial of service for affected users.

**Attack Vector:**

*   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Specially Crafted Message:** The attacker sends a specially crafted message to the Pidgin client. The specific protocols affected include Yahoo, MSN, MySpace, and XMPP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to the target Pidgin user.
*   **Valid Pidgin User (in some cases):** In the Yahoo protocol case, the attacker needs to be a valid Pidgin user.
*   **Knowledge of affected protocols:** The attacker needs to know how to send the specially crafted messages via Yahoo, MSN, MySpace, and XMPP.

**Affected Software:**

*   Pidgin

**Affected Platforms**

*   Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10, and 10.04 LTS
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5 and 6
*   Fedora 12 and 13
*   Slackware 12.0, 12.1, 12.2, 13.0, 13.1, and -current

**Mitigation:**

*   Update to the latest version of Pidgin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bugzilla entry describes multiple NULL pointer dereference crashes in various protocols (Yahoo, MSN, MySpace, XMPP, NTLM) due to unsanitized Base64 decoding.
*   Ubuntu knowledge base USN-1014-1 combines CVE-2010-3711 with CVE-2010-1624 in one security notice.
