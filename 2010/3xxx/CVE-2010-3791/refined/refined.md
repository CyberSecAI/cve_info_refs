- **Root cause:** A buffer overflow exists in QuickTime's handling of MPEG encoded movie files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Viewing a maliciously crafted movie file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Viewing a specially crafted MPEG encoded movie file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to create a malicious MPEG encoded movie file and make a victim view it with a vulnerable version of QuickTime.
