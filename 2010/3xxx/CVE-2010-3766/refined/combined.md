1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to update 3.6.13 to fix several security issues.
Also Mozilla Thunderbird and Seamonkey were updated on openSUSE.
Following security issues were fixed:
MFSA 2010-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several
memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough
effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
Jesee Ruderman, Andreas Gal, Nils, and Brian Hackett reported
memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and Firefox
3.5. (CVE-2010-3776)
Igor Bukanov reported a memory safety problem that was fixed in
Firefox 3.6 only. (CVE-2010-3777)
Jesse Ruderman reported a crash which affected Firefox 3.5 only. (CVE-2010-3778)
MFSA 2010-75 / CVE-2010-3769: Dirk Heinrich reported that on Windows
platforms when document.write() was called with a very long string
a buffer overflow was caused in line breaking routines attempting
to process the string for display. Such cases triggered an invalid
read past the end of an array causing a crash which an attacker could
potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-76 / CVE-2010-3771: Security researcher echo reported that
a web page could open a window with an about:blank location and then
inject an <isindex> element into that page which upon submission would
redirect to a chrome: document. The effect of this defect was that the
original page would wind up with a reference to a chrome-privileged
object, the opened window, which could be leveraged for privilege
escalation attacks.
Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 provided proof-of-concept
code demonstrating how the above vulnerability could be used to run
arbitrary code with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-77 / CVE-2010-3772: Security researcher wushi of team509
reported that when a XUL tree had an HTML <div> element nested inside a
<treechildren> element then code attempting to display content in the
XUL tree would incorrectly treat the <div> element as a parent node
to tree content underneath it resulting in incorrect indexes being
calculated for the child content. These incorrect indexes were used
in subsequent array operations which resulted in writing data past
the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could use this issue to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on their machine.
MFSA 2010-78 / CVE-2010-3768: Mozilla added the OTS font sanitizing
library to prevent downloadable fonts from exposing vulnerabilities
in the underlying OS font code. This library mitigates against several
issues independently reported by Red Hat Security Response Team member
Marc Schoenefeld and Mozilla security researcher Christoph Diehl.
MFSA 2010-79 / CVE-2010-3775: Security researcher Gregory Fleischer
reported that when a Java LiveConnect script was loaded via a data:
URL which redirects via a meta refresh, then the resulting plugin
object was created with the wrong security principal and thus received
elevated privileges such as the abilities to read local files, launch
processes, and create network connections.
MFSA 2010-80 / CVE-2010-3766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a nsDOMAttribute node
can be modified without informing the iterator object responsible
for various DOM traversals. This flaw could lead to a inconsistent
state where the iterator points to an object it believes is part of
the DOM but actually points to some other object. If such an object
had been deleted and its memory reclaimed by the system, then the
iterator could be used to call into attacker-controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-81 / CVE-2010-3767: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that JavaScript arrays
were vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability. The report
demonstrated that an array could be constructed containing a very
large number of items such that when memory was allocated to store the
array items, the integer value used to calculate the buffer size would
overflow resulting in too small a buffer being allocated. Subsequent
use of the array object could then result in data being written past
the end of the buffer and causing memory corruption.
MFSA 2010-82 / CVE-2010-3773: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the fix for CVE-2010-0179 could be circumvented
permitting the execution of arbitrary JavaScript with chrome
privileges.
MFSA 2010-83 / CVE-2010-3774: Google security researcher Michal
Zalewski reported that when a window was opened to a site resulting
in a network or certificate error page, the opening site could access
the document inside the opened window and inject arbitrary content. An
attacker could use this bug to spoof the location bar and trick a user
into thinking they were on a different site than they actually were.
MFSA 2010-84 / CVE-2010-3770: Security researchers Yosuke Hasegawa
and Masatoshi Kimura reported that the x-mac-arabic, x-mac-farsi and
x-mac-hebrew character encodings are vulnerable to XSS attacks due
to some characters being converted to angle brackets when displayed
by the rendering engine. Sites using these character encodings would
thus be potentially vulnerable to script injection attacks if their
script filtering code fails to strip out these specific characters.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart all running Mozilla instances after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-1019-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

9 December 2010

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

* [xulrunner-1.9.2](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.2) - XUL + XPCOM application runner

## Details

Jesse Ruderman, Andreas Gal, Nils, Brian Hackett, and Igor Bukanov

discovered several memory issues in the browser engine. An attacker could

exploit these to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3776](/security/CVE-2010-3776), [CVE-2010-3777](/security/CVE-2010-3777), [CVE-2010-3778](/security/CVE-2010-3778))

It was discovered that Firefox did not properly verify the about:blank

location elements when it was opened via window.open(). An attacker could

exploit this to run arbitrary code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2010-3771](/security/CVE-2010-3771))

It was discovered that Firefox did not properly handle <div> elements

when processing a XUL tree. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

web page, an attacker could exploit this to crash the browser or possibly

run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3772](/security/CVE-2010-3772))

Marc Schoenefeld and Christoph Diehl discovered several problems when

handling downloadable fonts. The new OTS font sanitizing library was added

to mitigate these issues. ([CVE-2010-3768](/security/CVE-2010-3768))

Gregory Fleischer discovered that the Java LiveConnect script could be made

to run in the wrong security context. An attacker could exploit this to

read local files and run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3775](/security/CVE-2010-3775))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could exploit this to

crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-3766](/security/CVE-2010-3766), [CVE-2010-3767](/security/CVE-2010-3767), [CVE-2010-3773](/security/CVE-2010-3773))

Michal Zalewski discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle

displaying pages from network or certificate errors. An attacker could

exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as in a phishing attack.

([CVE-2010-3774](/security/CVE-2010-3774))

Yosuke Hasegawa and Masatoshi Kimura discovered that several character

encodings would have some characters converted to angle brackets. An

attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

([CVE-2010-3770](/security/CVE-2010-3770))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ZDI-CAN-898: Mozilla Firefox nsDOMAttribute MutationObserver Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- CVSS ----------------------------------------------------------------
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following
products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within the application's support of an API used
for element traversal. Due to a particular element not implementing
functionality required by the API, a use-after free vulnerability can be
made to occur. This can be used to achieve code execution under the
context of the application.
The issue occurs within the application's support of the NodeIterator
API that is used for DOM Traversal as outlined in the DOM specification
on w3.org.
In order to support the node iteration, the application needs to keep
track of modifications to the dom tree in order to update the state of
the iterator. This is done explicitly by a pair of methods called
AddMutationObserver/RemoveMutationObserver. Anytime an element is
created, the observer list will be updated so that a node iterator can
adjust for modified elements.
When adding an element, it will need to update the MutationObserver list
as in the following code.
content/base/src/nsNodeIterator.cpp:185
nsNodeIterator::nsNodeIterator(nsINode \*aRoot,
PRUint32 aWhatToShow,
nsIDOMNodeFilter \*aFilter,
PRBool aExpandEntityReferences) :
nsTraversal(aRoot, aWhatToShow, aFilter, aExpandEntityReferences),
mDetached(PR\_FALSE),
mPointer(mRoot, PR\_TRUE)
{
aRoot->AddMutationObserver(this); // XXX
}
nsNodeIterator::~nsNodeIterator()
{
/\* destructor code \*/
if (!mDetached && mRoot)
mRoot->RemoveMutationObserver(this); // XXX
}
AddMutationObserver/RemoveMutationObserver will add the provided element
to a page-global list that can be queried by the NodeIterator.
content/base/src/nsGenericElement.cpp:295
void
nsINode::AddMutationObserver(nsIMutationObserver\* aMutationObserver)
{
nsSlots\* slots = GetSlots();
if (slots) {
slots->mMutationObservers.AppendElementUnlessExists(aMutationObserver);
}
}
void
nsINode::RemoveMutationObserver(nsIMutationObserver\* aMutationObserver)
{
nsSlots\* slots = GetExistingSlots();
if (slots) {
slots->mMutationObservers.RemoveElement(aMutationObserver);
}
}
One element however does not update the mutation list. This is the
nsDOMAttribute and is defined in content/base/src/nsDOMAttribute.cpp.
This will allow someone to manipulate the nsDOMAttribute node without
the nsNodeIterator api being informed. This will bypass the type-safety
of the compiler and can lead to code execution.
Version(s) tested: Mozilla Firefox
Platform(s) tested: Windows XP SP3

I get a js error on trunk:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception...

I believe this has been fixed on trunk with [bug 540848](/show_bug.cgi?id=540848 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add appendChild/insertBefore/replaceChild/removeChild on nsINode") with the following changesets:

Forget [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=590771#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsDOMAttribute MutationObserver Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-898)"), this is not related actually.
Very likely, this is fixed on trunk because of a regression of [bug 566416](/show_bug.cgi?id=566416 "RESOLVED FIXED - GetFirstChild broken for attribute nodes"). I filed [bug 598877](/show_bug.cgi?id=598877 "RESOLVED FIXED - .firstChild returns null for attributes even when .value has been set") about the regression. Quickly, attributes.firstChild returns null in the test case with the current trunk which is wrong and make the script fail too early.
This bug expected, this is not fixed on trunk apparently.

Yes. The code has changed so the current patch will not fix the issue on trunk.

Patch for 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 [checked-in]
Add a comment to the declaration of AttributeChildRemoved that says that attributes never have more than 1 children and so this is always that one single child that is removed.

I actually found a few regressions from [bug 566416](/show_bug.cgi?id=566416 "RESOLVED FIXED - GetFirstChild broken for attribute nodes") and my patch for trunk is built on top of them, so I'm marking them as dependencies.Depends on: [598877](/show_bug.cgi?id=598877 "RESOLVED FIXED - .firstChild returns null for attributes even when .value has been set"), [600466](/show_bug.cgi?id=600466 "RESOLVED FIXED - removeChild on attribute node does nothing"), [600468](/show_bug.cgi?id=600468 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting value to the empty string doesn't remove attribute's first child"), [600471](/show_bug.cgi?id=600471 "RESOLVED FIXED - When attaching an already created attribute to a node, if you call setAttribute on the node, the attribute value will not be updated")

Patches should be pushed on branches (according to branch rules, I have to wait a few days before asking for an approval and it's not really urgent). In addition, I think that tests will have to be pushed after branch releases.

No, the approval policy for released branches is different than the one for under-development branches. For released branches all patches require approval, regardless of blocking status.

Note that eventually Firefox 4 will end up in that state -- think of the branches as perpetual "Release Candidate" stage. Rules for each tree are always on their tinderboxen, and they differ. Please check.

| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-80

## Use-after-free error with nsDOMAttribute MutationObserver

Announced
December 9, 2010
Reporter
regenrecht
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.16
* Firefox 3.6.13
* SeaMonkey 2.0.11

### Description

Security researcher **regenrecht** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a `nsDOMAttribute`
node can be modified without informing the iterator object responsible
for various DOM traversals. This flaw could lead to a inconsistent
state where the iterator points to an object it believes is part of
the DOM but actually points to some other object. If such an object
had been deleted and its memory reclaimed by the system, then the
iterator could be used to call into attacker-controlled memory.

firefox security update (RHSA-2010-0966)

Original Release Date: January 7, 2011

Last Revised: March 5, 2012

Number: ASA-2011-002

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-3766](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3766.html), [CVE-2010-3767](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3767.html), [CVE-2010-3772](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3772.html), [CVE-2010-3776](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3776.html) and [CVE-2010-3777](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3777.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JavaScript. A website
with an object containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox to
execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3771](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3771.html) to this issue.

This update adds support for the Sanitiser for OpenType (OTS) library to
Firefox. This library helps prevent potential exploits in malformed
OpenType fonts by verifying the font file prior to use. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3768](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3768.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox loaded Java LiveConnect scripts.
Malicious web content could load a Java LiveConnect script in a way that
would result in the plug-in object having elevated privileges, allowing it
to execute Java code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3775](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3775.html) to this issue.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2010-0179 was incomplete when the Firebug
add-on was used. If a user visited a website containing malicious
JavaScript while the Firebug add-on was enabled, it could cause Firefox to
execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3773](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3773.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox presented the location bar to users. A
malicious website could trick a user into thinking they are visiting the
site reported by the location bar, when the page is actually content
controlled by an attacker. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3774](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3774.html) to this issue.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Firefox x-mac-arabic,
x-mac-farsi, and x-mac-hebrew character encodings. Certain characters were
converted to angle brackets when displayed. If server-side script filtering
missed these cases, it could result in Firefox executing JavaScript code
with the permissions of a different website. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3770](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3770.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0966.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Server 1000:  * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | 7.0, 7.5 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | 2.0.x | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya IQ | 4.2, 5.0, 5.1 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |
| Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 thru 5.2 SP3 | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2 SP4 or later. |
| Avaya Message Storage Server | 4.x, 5.0.x, 5.1.x, 5.2 through 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to Message Storage Server 5.2.10 or later. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |
| Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.2 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for the listed affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-3766 CVE-2010-3767 CVE-2010-3768 CVE-2010-3770 CVE-2010-3771 CVE-2010-3772 CVE-2010-3773 CVE-2010-3774 CVE-2010-3775 CVE-2010-3776 CVE-2010-3777 | The risk level is None for CS 1000, IQ, Presence Services, Session Manager, and System Manager because they have xulrunner installed, but not Firefox. Therefore, these CVEs are not exploitable on these products. The risk level is Low for Messaging Storage Server, Message Networking, and IALX because they have the Firefox browser installed, but it is only intended for system management on these products. It's not intended that the browser be used for public Internet browsing, which would constitute non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.
