Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-3766:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Mozilla Firefox handles `nsDOMAttribute` nodes during DOM traversals using `NodeIterator` API.
*   Specifically, `nsDOMAttribute` nodes can be modified without informing the iterator object that is responsible for keeping track of the DOM changes, thus leading to inconsistencies.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** When an attribute node (`nsDOMAttribute`) is modified, the iterator object does not update its state. As a consequence, the iterator might hold a reference to an object that has already been deleted and its memory reclaimed. Using this stale reference leads to a use-after-free condition.
*   **Inconsistent DOM State:** Modifying the attribute node without updating the iterator object's state leads to an inconsistent view of the DOM. The iterator thinks it's pointing to a valid object that's still part of the DOM, while it might actually be pointing to reclaimed memory.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a crash and/or potentially execute arbitrary code by causing a use-after-free situation that can be controlled.
*   The attacker gains the ability to call into attacker-controlled memory, thus gaining code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a malicious website or a malicious file loaded within the browser that triggers a manipulation of  `nsDOMAttribute` nodes.
*   User interaction is required, as the user must be tricked to visit the malicious website or to open the malicious file.
*   The vulnerability occurs when the DOM is traversed using the `NodeIterator` API.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to create a specially crafted web page that manipulates `nsDOMAttribute` nodes.
*   The attacker must trick the user into loading the webpage in the vulnerable version of Firefox or SeaMonkey.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system.

**Additional Technical Details (from the opensuse.org content):**

*   The issue resides in the implementation of the `nsNodeIterator` class.
*   `AddMutationObserver` and `RemoveMutationObserver` methods update the MutationObserver list when DOM elements are created, changed or deleted. However, `nsDOMAttribute` node does not update this list. This lack of update allows attackers to manipulate `nsDOMAttribute` nodes without the iterator being informed, leading to the use-after-free.

**Summary of Fix:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring proper updates to the mutation list in the `nsDOMAttribute` implementation, so that the iterator object is aware of the changes to attribute nodes.
*   Patches were applied to Firefox and SeaMonkey as well as XULRunner to address the issue.
