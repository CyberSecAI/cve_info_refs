## Details

Cesar Bernardini and Felipe Andres Manzano discovered that FFmpeg

incorrectly handled certain malformed flic files. If a user were tricked

into opening a crafted flic file, an attacker could cause a denial of

service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-3429](/security/CVE-2010-3429))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed

wmv files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted wmv file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2010-3908](/security/CVE-2010-3908))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed ogg

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted ogg file, an attacker

could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-4704](/security/CVE-2010-4704))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed WebM

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted WebM file, an attacker

could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2011-0480](/security/CVE-2011-0480))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed

RealMedia files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted RealMedia

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2011-0722](/security/CVE-2011-0722))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed

VC1 files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted VC1 file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2011-0723](/security/CVE-2011-0723))

Subject: [oCERT-2010-004] FFmpeg/libavcodec arbitrary offset dereference

#2010-004 FFmpeg/libavcodec arbitrary offset dereference

Description:

The libavcodec library, an open source video encoding/decoding library part of
the FFmpeg project, suffers from an arbitrary offset dereference vulnerability.

The vulnerability affects the flic file format parser, insufficient
restrictions on a writable buffer can be exploited to execute arbitrary code
via the heap memory. A specific flic file can be crafted to trigger the
vulnerability.

The MPlayer multimedia player is also affected as it statically includes
libavcodec, the flic codec can be disabled in codecs.conf configuration file in
order to workaround the issue.

Affected version:

libavcodec <= 0.6

MPlayer <= 1.0_rc3, snapshot 2010-09-27

Fixed version:

libavcodec >= r25223 (see References)

MPlayer >= snapshot 2010-09-28

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=635775#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-20 17:01:12 UTC  ``` oCERT reported a vulnerability that affects the flic video codec support in ffmpeg.  Quoting:  "The MPlayer package [1] is vulnerable to an arbitrary offset dereference vulnerability, which could be exploited by malicious remote attacker. The vulnerability is caused by the MPlayer's flic codec (flicvideo.c) on 8 bits per pixel videos because the codec does not check received values. This could be exploited jumping to arbitrary code by opening a specially crafted file."  They were particularly concerned about the ffmpeg inclusion in mplayer.  The affected file (flicvideo.c) is also present in libextractor as provided by Fedora 12.  It looks as though the only thing using libextractor in Fedora is doodle (local search program, like Spotlight).  This would mean a user would have to download a specially crafted file and store it locally, and be using doodle to index files.  I don't know whether or not doodle would be problematic here, i.e. if it's just reading metadata it might not cause any problems at all.  Later versions of libextractor have removed the embedded ffmpeg sources.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=635775#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-20 17:08:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 448516](attachment.cgi?id=448516&action=diff "patch from upstream to correct the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=448516&action=edit "patch from upstream to correct the issue") patch from upstream to correct the issue   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=635775#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-20 17:09:13 UTC  ``` This will be fixed as part of ffmpeg 0.6.1.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=635775#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-28 15:50:54 UTC  ``` This is now public:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2010-004.html>  Neither ffmpeg nor mplayer are shipped in any supported products, however libextractor in Fedora 12 does contain embedded ffmpeg.  Later versions of libextractor have removed embedded ffmpeg; not sure if it is possible to update libextractor in Fedora 12 to the version in Fedora 13; if not, it should be patched to correct the flaw.  The patch to correct the flaw is here:  <http://git.ffmpeg.org/?p=ffmpeg;a=commitdiff;h=16c592155f117ccd7b86006c45aacc692a81c23b>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=635775#c5)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-28 15:51:31 UTC  ``` Created libextractor tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-12 [[bug 638265](show_bug.cgi?id=638265 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2010-3429 ffmpeg: arbitrary offset dereference vulnerability in flic video codec (oCERT-2010-004) [fedora-12]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=635775#c6)  Enrico Scholz    2010-09-29 08:03:23 UTC  ``` ffmpeg support in libextractor is disabled because 'mpeg2dec' requirement is not available in fedora:  | checking whether to enable the FFmpeg thumbnail extractor... no   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=635775#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-29 16:56:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=635775#c6)) > ffmpeg support in libextractor is disabled because 'mpeg2dec' requirement is > not available in fedora: >  > | checking whether to enable the FFmpeg thumbnail extractor... no  Ok, great, thank you for checking that.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg coders, which are used by
by MPlayer and other applications.

CVE-2010-3429

  Cesar Bernardini and Felipe Andres Manzano reported an arbitrary offset
  dereference vulnerability in the libavcodec, in particular in the flic file
  format parser. A specific flic file may exploit this vulnerability and execute
  arbitrary code. Mplayer is also affected by this problem, as well as other
  software that use this library.

CVE-2010-4704

  Greg Maxwell discovered an integer overflow the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg. A
  specific ogg file may exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-4705

  A potential integer overflow has been discovered in the Vorbis decoder in
  FFmpeg.

This upload also fixes an incomplete patch from DSA-2000-1. Michael Gilbert
noticed that there was remaining vulnerabilities, which  may cause a denial of
service and potentially execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.svn20080206-18+lenny3.

We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg-debian packages.

source video encoding/decoding library part of the FFmpeg project, suffers from
an arbitrary offset dereference vulnerability.

The vulnerability affects the flic file format parser, insufficient
restrictions on a writable buffer can be exploited to execute arbitrary code
via the heap memory. A specific flic file can be crafted to trigger the
vulnerability.

The MPlayer multimedia player is also affected as it statically includes
libavcodec, the flic codec can be disabled in codecs.conf configuration file in
order to workaround the issue.
