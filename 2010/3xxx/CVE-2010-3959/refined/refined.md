Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-3959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the OpenType Font (OTF) driver not properly parsing the CMAP table when rendering a specially crafted OpenType font.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper parsing of the CMAP table within the OTF driver. This can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution vulnerability.
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain complete control of the affected system remotely.
- This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights
    - In some cases, a denial of service may be achieved

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Share (Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2):**
  - An attacker can host a specially crafted OpenType font on a network share.
  - When a user navigates to the share via Windows Explorer, the preview or details pane triggers the affected control path, exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Local Exploitation (Windows XP and Windows Server 2003):**
  - Requires an attacker to first log on to the local system.
  - After gaining local access, an attacker can run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Web-based Attacks:**
  - An attacker can host a website with a specially crafted embedded OpenType font.
  - If a user visits the site with a vulnerable browser that renders the font, the vulnerability can be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a specially crafted OpenType font on a network share or a webserver.
- For Windows XP and Server 2003, the attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- For web-based attacks, attackers need to convince users to visit malicious website.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when the operating system attempts to parse/render the specially crafted font file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the OpenType Font (OTF) driver, which is used by the operating system to handle font rendering.
- Third-party web browsers that render OpenType fonts may also be vulnerable. However, Internet Explorer is not affected by this issue by default.
- Workstations and terminal servers are at higher risk.
- Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer can act as a workaround to mitigate the vulnerability by preventing automatic rendering of fonts in Windows Explorer.
- The CMAP table is a critical part of a font file, and improper parsing can have serious consequences.

This vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, and **Important** for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
