  "cve": "CVE-2010-3166",
  "description": "A heap buffer overflow exists in Mozilla Firefox due to a flaw in code routines responsible for transforming text runs. A specially crafted page with a bidirectional text run, when reflowed, can lead to an incorrect length calculation for the text run. This value is then used to allocate memory for the text, potentially creating a buffer that is too small, leading to a heap buffer overflow that can allow for arbitrary code execution.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Firefox 3.5.12",
    "Firefox 3.6.9",
    "SeaMonkey 2.0.7",
    "Thunderbird 3.0.7",
    "Thunderbird 3.1.3"
  ],
  "root_cause": "Incorrect calculation of text run length during reflow of bidirectional text, leading to an undersized buffer allocation.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Heap buffer overflow"
  ],
  "impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to heap overflow.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Specially crafted web page"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a web page with a malicious bidirectional text run.",
