- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a DLL hijacking issue. Specifically, the Skype application attempts to load the `wab32.dll` file from a predictable location, which an attacker can exploit by placing a malicious DLL with the same name in that location.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue, where the application loads a DLL from a user-controlled path without proper validation or secure loading practices. This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Skype application. This means the attacker can perform actions such as: access user data, monitor activity, potentially install further malicious software, or gain persistent access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is local. The attacker needs to place a specially crafted `wab32.dll` file in specific folders, which are: `%commonprogramfiles%\system` for 32 bit systems and `%commonprogramfiles(x86)%` on 64 bit systems
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to write files into the system's `%commonprogramfiles%\system` or `%commonprogramfiles(x86)%` folder. This usually implies having some level of local access to the machine.

The provided exploit code details the creation of a malicious DLL (`wab32.dll`) that, when loaded by Skype, displays a message box, confirming that arbitrary code execution was achieved.
