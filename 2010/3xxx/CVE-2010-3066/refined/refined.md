Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2010-3066:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing backport patch in the Linux kernel's Asynchronous I/O (AIO) implementation. Specifically, the issue lies within the `io_submit_one()` function. When the `IOCB_FLAG_RESFD` flag is set, and the `iocb->aio_resfd` is incorrect, the code would jump to the `out_put_req` label. At this label, the `aio_put_req()` function is called, but this function expects `req->ki_filp` to be set, which is not always the case leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `aio_put_req()` function.  The condition that triggers the vulnerability is when the `IOCB_FLAG_RESFD` flag is set but the `iocb->aio_resfd` is invalid, which leads to an execution path where `req->ki_filp` is not initialized before being used by `aio_put_req()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability would result in a kernel crash due to the NULL pointer dereference, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the vulnerable code path in the `io_submit_one()` function by manipulating AIO requests with the `IOCB_FLAG_RESFD` flag and providing an invalid `aio_resfd`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to submit asynchronous I/O requests to the kernel with the specific flag set (`IOCB_FLAG_RESFD`) and control or manipulate the `aio_resfd` value such that it is invalid, which could require local access.

**Additional details from content:**
- The bug report mentions that this issue was reported by Tavis Ormandy.
- The vulnerability was confirmed to exist in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 were not affected because they didn't include support for `eventfd` in AIO implementation.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via RHSA-2010:0839.
- VMware ESX also addressed this vulnerability as part of a larger update, VMSA-2011-0012.

In summary, the vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference triggered by specific conditions in the Linux AIO subsystem, potentially leading to a kernel crash. It requires the attacker to submit AIO requests with a specific flag set and provide an invalid descriptor value.
