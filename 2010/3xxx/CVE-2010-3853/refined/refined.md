Please\nreview the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.\n\n### Impact\n\nA local attacker could use specially crafted files to cause a buffer\noverflow, possibly resulting in privilege escalation or Denial of\nService. Furthermore, a local attacker could execute specially crafted\nprograms or symlink attacks, possibly resulting in data loss or\ndisclosure of sensitive information.\n\n### Workaround\n\nThere is no known workaround at this time.\n\n### Resolution\n\nAll Linux-PAM users should upgrade to the latest version:\n\n```\n # emerge --sync\n # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose \">=sys-libs/pam-1.1.5\"\n\n```\n\nNOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are\navailable since November 25, 2011. It is likely that your system is\nalready no longer affected by this issue.\n\n### References\n\n* [CVE-2010-3316](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-3316)\n* [CVE-2010-3430](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-3430)\n* [CVE-2010-3431](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-3431)\n* [CVE-2010-3435](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-3435)\n* [CVE-2010-3853](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-3853)\n* [CVE-2010-4706](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-4706)\n* [CVE-2010-4707](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-4707)\n* [CVE-2010-4708](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-4708)\n* [CVE-2011-3148](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3148)\n* [CVE-2011-3149](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2011-3149)\n\n**Release date**\n\nJune 25, 2012\n\n**Latest revision**\n\nJune 25, 2012: 1\n\n**Severity**\n\nhigh\n\n**Exploitable**\n\nlocal\n\n**Bugzilla entries**\n\n* [343399](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343399)\n* [386273](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=386273)\n* [388431](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=388431)\n\n### Questions or comments?\n\nPlease feel free to contact us.\n\n**Â© 2001â€“2020 Gentoo Foundation, Inc.**\n",
