| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=643043#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-14 14:09:16 UTC  ``` Tomas Mraz pointed out that pam_namespace PAM module executes external namespace.init script with an environment settings inherited form the program or service that has pam_namespace configured.  Such environment may be untrusted in some cases (when running setuid program that does not sanitize environment prior to calling PAM), and may allow local user to escalate privileges.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=643043#c2)  Tomas Mraz    2010-10-14 18:15:11 UTC  ``` Testing instructions:  1. add line: /var/tmp /var/tmp-inst/   	user       ~root  to /etc/security/namespace.conf 2. add line: session optional pam_namespace.so  to /etc/pam.d/sudo  3. add line /usr/bin/printenv  to be executed in the /etc/security/namespace.init  4. add a command such as /usr/bin/id to be allowed in sudoers: testuser ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/id  5. run sudo /usr/bin/id as testuser and observe that the current environment of the calling user is printed - you can for example augment the PATH to anything you like.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=643043#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-25 13:46:17 UTC  ``` Public now via upstream CVS commit: <http://pam.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pam/Linux-PAM/modules/pam_namespace/pam_namespace.c?view=log#rev1.13>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=643043#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-01 19:50:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0819 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0819.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=643043#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-16 17:52:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2010:0891 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0891.html>   ``` |  |

# Linux-PAM: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201206-31**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Linux-PAM, allowing
local attackers to possibly gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, corrupt data, or obtain sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/pam** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.5** |

### Background

Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is an architecture allowing
the separation of the development of privilege granting software from the
development of secure and appropriate authentication schemes.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Linux-PAM. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could use specially crafted files to cause a buffer
overflow, possibly resulting in privilege escalation or Denial of
Service. Furthermore, a local attacker could execute specially crafted
programs or symlink attacks, possibly resulting in data loss or
disclosure of sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Linux-PAM users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/pam-1.1.5"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since November 25, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
