Debian Bug(s)  :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leak.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-2963

    Kees Cook discovered an issue in the v4l 32-bit compatibility layer for
    64-bit systems that allows local users with /dev/video write permission to
    overwrite arbitrary kernel memory, potentially leading to a privilege
    escalation. On Debian systems, access to /dev/video devices is restricted to
    members of the 'video' group by default.

CVE-2010-3067

    Tavis Ormandy discovered an issue in the io_submit system call. Local users
    can cause an integer overflow resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-3296

    remote user to cause a denial of service (kernel panic).

CVE-2010-3437

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the pktcdvd driver. Local users with
    permission to open /dev/pktcdvd/control can obtain the contents of sensitive
    kernel memory or cause a denial of service. By default on Debian systems,
    this access is restricted to members of the group 'cdrom'.

CVE-2010-3442

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the ALSA sound system. Local users with
    permission to open /dev/snd/controlC0 can create an integer overflow
    condition that causes a denial of service. By default on Debian systems,
    this access is restricted to members of the group 'audio'.

CVE-2010-3448

    Dan Jacobson reported an issue in the thinkpad-acpi driver. On certain
    Thinkpad systems, local users can cause a denial of service (X.org crash) by
    reading /proc/acpi/ibm/video.

CVE-2010-3477

    Jeff Mahoney discovered an issue in the Traffic Policing (act_police) module
    that allows local users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3705

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the HMAC processing code in the SCTP
    protocol that allows remote users to create a denial of service (memory
    corruption).

CVE-2010-3848

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    cause a stack overflow condition with large msg->msgiovlen values that can
    result in a denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2010-3849

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    cause a denial of service (oops) if a NULL remote addr value is passed as a
    parameter to sendmsg().

CVE-2010-3850

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    assign econet addresses to arbitrary interfaces due to a missing
    capabilities check.

CVE-2010-3858

    Brad Spengler reported an issue in the setup_arg_pages() function. Due to a
    bounds-checking failure, local users can create a denial of service (kernel
    oops).

CVE-2010-3859

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the TIPC protocol. When the tipc module
    is loaded, local users can gain elevated privileges via the sendmsg() system
    call.

CVE-2010-3873

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the X.25 network protocol. Local users
    can cause heap corruption, resulting in a denial of service (kernel panic).

CVE-2010-3874

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the Control Area Network (CAN)
    subsystem on 64-bit systems. Local users may be able to cause a denial of
    service (heap corruption).

CVE-2010-3875

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the AX.25 protocol. Local users can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3876

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the Packet protocol. Local users can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3877

    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered an issue in the TIPC protocol. Local users can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3880

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the INET_DIAG subsystem. Local users
    can cause the kernel to execute unaudited INET_DIAG bytecode, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2010-4072

    Kees Cook discovered an issue in the System V shared memory subsystem.
    Local users can obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-4073

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the System V shared memory subsystem.
    Local users on 64-bit system can obtain the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory via the 32-bit compatible semctl() system call.

CVE-2010-4074

    Dan Rosenberg reported issues in the mos7720 and mos7840 drivers for USB
    serial converter devices. Local users with access to these devices can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-4078

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the framebuffer driver for SiS graphics
    chipesets (sisfb). Local users with access to the framebuffer device can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory via the FBIOGET_VBLANK ioctl.

CVE-2010-4079

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the ivtvfb driver used for the Hauppauge
    PVR-350 card. Local users with access to the framebuffer device can obtain
    the contents of sensitive kernel memory via the FBIOGET_VBLANK ioctl.

CVE-2010-4080

    audio devices. Local users with access to the audio device can obtain the
    contents of sensitive kernel memory via the SNDRV_HDSP_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG_INFO
    ioctl.

CVE-2010-4081

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the ALSA driver for RME Hammerfall DSP
    MADI audio devices. Local users with access to the audio device can obtain
    the contents of sensitive kernel memory via the
    SNDRV_HDSP_IOCTL_GET_CONFIG_INFO ioctl.

CVE-2010-4083

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the semctl system call. Local users can
    obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory through usage of the semid_ds
    structure.

CVE-2010-4164

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the X.25 network protocol. Remote users
    can achieve a denial of service (infinite loop) by taking advantage of an
    integer underflow in the facility parsing code.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=644156#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-10-19 03:19:52 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by Nelson Elhage.  [CVE-2010-3848](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3848) AF_ECONET kernel stack overflow [CVE-2010-3849](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3849) AF_ECONET saddr->cookie NULL dereferences [CVE-2010-3850](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3850) AF_ECONET SIOCSIFADDR ioctl does not check privileges  The two main vulnerabilities lie in the econet_sendmsg() function. If CONFIG_ECONET_AUNUDP, the function declares a variable-length array of iovec's on the stack:  static int econet_sendmsg(struct kiocb *iocb, struct socket *sock, 			  struct msghdr *msg, size_t len) {         ... #ifdef CONFIG_ECONET_AUNUDP 	... 	struct iovec iov[msg->msg_iovlen+1]; 	... #endif  "msg->msg_iovlen" is a user-controlled value <= 1024; 1024 'struct iovec's is enough to overflow the kernel stack and clobber the 'thread_info' struct on either 32- or 64-bit systems with or without CONFIG_4KSTACKS.  The code populates 'iov' with user-controlled values, so this is almost certainly exploitable for privesc.  The second bug is conveniently labeled as such for anyone who cares to look:  		/* BUG: saddr may be NULL */ 		eb->cookie = saddr->cookie;  In fact, 'saddr' comes from userspace and may be NULL (if non-NULL, it will have been copied to kernelspace), leading to a NULL-pointer dereference. This saddr->cookie dereference appears twice, once in the "hardware" case and once in the "UDP emulation" case. This is easily exploitable for an oops, but probably not anything more.  The final issue is in the ec_dev_ioctl function. The SIOCSIFADDR ioctl does not check privileges, allowing an unprivileged user to assign econet addresses to arbitrary interfaces. It is possible this is intentional, but AFAIK it would be unusual for SIOCSIFADDR to be unprivileged, so this may be an accident.  Note that it is necessary to use this property in order to make the first two bugs exploitable, since econet_sendmsg will return almost immediately if no econet addresses are configured.

This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, 6 or Red Hat Enterprise MRG. Red Hat does not provide support for the Acorn Econet network protocol.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=644156#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-11-29 03:13:59 UTC  ``` Proposed patches: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a27e13d370415add3487949c60810e36069a23a6> <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commit;h=fa0e846494792e722d817b9d3d625a4ef4896c96> <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commit;h=16c41745c7b92a243d0874f534c1655196c64b74>   ``` |  |

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update to the SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP 1 Realtime Extension
kernel brings various bug and lots of security fixes.
This update also integrates upstream 2.6.33.7-rt29->2.6.33.7.2-rt30
changes.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-2962: Missing sanity checks in pread/pwrite in the i915
graphics driver allowed local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and
so gain privileges. This required a i915 graphics card to be effective.
CVE-2010-3310: Multiple integer signedness errors in net/rose/af\_rose.c
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a rose\_getname function call, related to the rose\_bind and
rose\_connect functions.
CVE-2010-3080: A double free in an alsa error path was fixed, which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-3081: Incorrect buffer handling in the biarch-compat buffer
handling could be used by local attackers to gain root privileges. This
problem affects foremost x86\_64, or potentially other biarch platforms,
like PowerPC and S390x.
CVE-2010-2960: The keyctl\_session\_to\_parent function in
security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel expects that a certain
parent session keyring exists, which allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a KEYCTL\_SESSION\_TO\_PARENT
argument to the keyctl function.
CVE-2010-3084: A buffer overflow in the ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL code
could be used to crash the kernel or potentially execute code.
CVE-2010-2955: A kernel information leak via the WEXT ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-3301: Mismatch between 32bit and 64bit register usage in the
system call entry path could be used by local attackers to gain root
privileges. This problem only affects x86\_64 kernels.
CVE-2010-3298: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/usb/hso driver.
CVE-2010-3296: Fixed a kernel information leak in the cxgb3 driver.
CVE-2010-3297: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/eql driver.
CVE-2010-3078: Fixed a kernel information leak in the xfs filesystem.
CVE-2010-3079: Fixed a ftrace NULL pointer dereference problem which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-2954: The irda\_bind function in net/irda/af\_irda.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle failure of the irda\_open\_tsap
function, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified
other impact via multiple unsuccessful calls to bind on an AF\_IRDA
(aka PF\_IRDA) socket.
CVE-2010-2959: Integer overflow in net/can/bcm.c in the Controller
Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel allowed attackers
to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (system crash)
via crafted CAN traffic.
CVE-2010-2946: The 'os2' xattr namespace on the jfs filesystem could
be used to bypass xattr namespace rules.
CVE-2010-2942: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net scheduler
code.
CVE-2010-3015: Integer overflow in the ext4\_ext\_get\_blocks function
in fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (BUG and system crash) via a write operation on
the last block of a large file, followed by a sync operation.
CVE-2010-2803: The drm\_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_drv.c
in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel
allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from
kernel memory by requesting a large memory-allocation amount.
CVE-2010-2226: The xfs\_swapext function in fs/xfs/xfs\_dfrag.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly check the file descriptors passed to
the SWAPEXT ioctl, which allowed local users to leverage write access
and obtain read access by swapping one file into another file.
CVE-2010-3849: The econet\_sendmsg function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel, when an econet address is configured, allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
and OOPS) via a sendmsg call that specifies a NULL value for the
remote address field.
CVE-2010-3848: Stack-based buffer overflow in the econet\_sendmsg
function in net/econet/af\_econet.c in the Linux kernel when an econet
address is configured, allowed local users to gain privileges by
providing a large number of iovec structures.
CVE-2010-3850: The ec\_dev\_ioctl function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel did not require the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability,
which allowed local users to bypass intended access restrictions and
configure econet addresses via an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4347: A local user could inject ACPI code into the kernel
via the world-writable "custom\_debug" file, allowing local privilege
escalation.
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address
in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with
other issues.
CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth\_ioctl\_alloc
could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.
CVE-2010-4165: The do\_tcp\_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP\_MAXSEG (aka MSS)
values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a
divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer.

sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSP\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4081: The snd\_hdspm\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSPM\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4082: The viafb\_ioctl\_get\_viafb\_info function in
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a VIAFB\_GET\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
CVE-2010-3432: The sctp\_packet\_config function in net/sctp/output.c
in the Linux kernel performed extraneous initializations of packet
data structures, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (panic) via a certain sequence of SCTP traffic.
CVE-2010-3067: Integer overflow in the do\_io\_submit function in
fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted use
of the io\_submit system call.
CVE-2010-3865: A iovec integer overflow in RDS sockets was fixed
which could lead to local attackers gaining kernel privileges.
CVE-2010-3904: A local privilege escalation in RDS sockets allowed
local attackers to gain root privileges.
2) Solution or Work-Around
Please install the updated packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Message-ID: <20101130010518.GJ23277@ksplice.com>

From: Nelson Elhage <nelhage@...lice.com>

Subject: kernel: Multiple vulnerabilities in AF_ECONET

I reported these recently, and they were fixed upstream last week.

CVE-2010-3848: Kernel stack overflow in econet_sendmsg
CVE-2010-3849: NULL pointer dereference in PF_ECONET
CVE-2010-3850: Missing check for capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) in econet SIOCSIFADDR

CVE-2010-3848 is interesting because it's a bug class I haven't seen before,
although maybe people who have been around longer have. econet_sendmsg() can be
made to allocate > 8192 bytes on the kernel stack, overflowing the two pages
allocated for the stack, and allowing an attacker to clobber the 'struct
thread_info', which provides several easy exploit vectors.

Jon Oberheide has done a more detailed writeup about this bug class here:
<http://jon.oberheide.org/blog/2010/11/29/exploiting-stack-overflows-in-the-linux-kernel/>

CVE-2010-3850 is mostly interesting because without it, there is no way an
unprivileged user can trigger the first two bugs unless an administrator has
already configured an econet address somewhere (econet_sendmsg fails quickly if
there are no econet addresses configured on the system).

Reference:
<http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2126>

CVE-2010-3848: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/a27e13d370415add3487949c60810e36069a23a6>
CVE-2010-3849: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa0e846494792e722d817b9d3d625a4ef4896c96>
CVE-2010-3850: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/16c41745c7b92a243d0874f534c1655196c64b74>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This patch updates the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 kernel to fix
various security issues and some bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-4242: The hci\_uart\_tty\_open function in the HCI UART driver
(drivers/bluetooth/hci\_ldisc.c) in the Linux kernel did not verify
whether the tty has a write operation, which allowed local users
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via vectors
related to the Bluetooth driver.
CVE-2010-4527: The load\_mixer\_volumes function in sound/oss/soundcard.c
in the OSS sound subsystem in the Linux kernel incorrectly expected
that a certain name field ends with a '\0' character, which allowed
local users to conduct buffer overflow attacks and gain privileges,
or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, via a
SOUND\_MIXER\_SETLEVELS ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4529: Integer underflow in the irda\_getsockopt function in
net/irda/af\_irda.c in the Linux kernel on platforms other than x86
allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from
kernel heap memory via an IRLMP\_ENUMDEVICES getsockopt call.
CVE-2010-4342: The aun\_incoming function in net/econet/af\_econet.c in
the Linux kernel, when Econet is enabled, allowed remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS)
by sending an Acorn Universal Networking (AUN) packet over UDP.
CVE-2010-2946: fs/jfs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
handle a certain legacy format for storage of extended attributes,
which might have allowed local users by bypass intended xattr namespace
restrictions via an "os2." substring at the beginning of a name.
CVE-2010-3848: Stack-based buffer overflow in the econet\_sendmsg
function in net/econet/af\_econet.c in the Linux kernel, when an
econet address is configured, allowed local users to gain privileges
by providing a large number of iovec structures.
CVE-2010-3849: The econet\_sendmsg function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel, when an econet address is configured, allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
and OOPS) via a sendmsg call that specifies a NULL value for the
remote address field.
CVE-2010-3850: The ec\_dev\_ioctl function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel does not require the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability,
which allowed local users to bypass intended access restrictions and
configure econet addresses via an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4258: The do\_exit function in kernel/exit.c in the Linux
kernel did not properly handle a KERNEL\_DS get\_fs value, which
allowed local users to bypass intended access\_ok restrictions,
overwrite arbitrary kernel memory locations, and gain privileges by
leveraging a (1) BUG, (2) NULL pointer dereference, or (3) page fault,
as demonstrated by vectors involving the clear\_child\_tid feature and
the splice system call.
CVE-2010-4160: Multiple integer overflows in the (1) pppol2tp\_sendmsg
function in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c, and the (2) l2tp\_ip\_sendmsg function
in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ip.c, in the PPPoL2TP and IPoL2TP implementations
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption and panic) or possibly gain privileges via
a crafted sendto call.
CVE-2010-4157: Integer overflow in the ioc\_general function in
drivers/scsi/gdth.c in the Linux kernel on 64-bit platforms allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a large argument in an ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4164: Multiple integer underflows in the x25\_parse\_facilities
function in net/x25/x25\_facilities.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via malformed
X.25 (1) X25\_FAC\_CLASS\_A, (2) X25\_FAC\_CLASS\_B, (3) X25\_FAC\_CLASS\_C,
or (4) X25\_FAC\_CLASS\_D facility data, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2010-3873.
CVE-2010-4158: The sk\_run\_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the
Linux kernel did not check whether a certain memory location has been
initialized before executing a (1) BPF\_S\_LD\_MEM or (2) BPF\_S\_LDX\_MEM
instruction, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel stack memory via a crafted socket filter.
CVE-2010-3442: Multiple integer overflows in the snd\_ctl\_new function
in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted (1) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD or
(2) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_REPLACE ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4081: The snd\_hdspm\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSPM\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
CVE-2010-3067: Integer overflow in the do\_io\_submit function in
fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted use
of the io\_submit system call.
CVE-2010-3310: Multiple integer signedness errors in net/rose/af\_rose.c
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a rose\_getname function call, related to the rose\_bind and
rose\_connect functions.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-1023-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

30 November 2010

The Linux kernel could be made to run unauthorized programs with
administrator privileges.

## Details

Nelson Elhage discovered several problems with the Acorn Econet protocol

driver. A local user could cause a denial of service via a NULL pointer

dereference, escalate privileges by overflowing the kernel stack, and

assign Econet addresses to arbitrary interfaces. ([CVE-2010-3848](/security/CVE-2010-3848),

[CVE-2010-3849](/security/CVE-2010-3849), [CVE-2010-3850](/security/CVE-2010-3850))

Brad Spengler discovered that the wireless extensions did not correctly

validate certain request sizes. A local attacker could exploit this to read

portions of kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-2955](/security/CVE-2010-2955))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the VIA video driver did not correctly clear

kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack

memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4082](/security/CVE-2010-4082))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's splice system call. A local

user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2013-2128](/security/CVE-2013-2128))

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This kernel update for the SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP3 kernel fixes
several security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address
in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with
other issues.
CVE-2010-3699: The backend driver in Xen 3.x allows guest OS users to
cause a denial of service via a kernel thread leak, which prevents the
device and guest OS from being shut down or create a zombie domain,
causes a hang in zenwatch, or prevents unspecified xm commands from
working properly, related to (1) netback, (2) blkback, or (3) blktap.
CVE-2010-3849: The econet\_sendmsg function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel, when an econet address is configured, allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
and OOPS) via a sendmsg call that specifies a NULL value for the
remote address field.
CVE-2010-3848: Stack-based buffer overflow in the econet\_sendmsg
function in net/econet/af\_econet.c in the Linux kernel when an econet
address is configured, allowed local users to gain privileges by
providing a large number of iovec structures.
CVE-2010-3850: The ec\_dev\_ioctl function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel did not require the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability,
which allowed local users to bypass intended access restrictions and
configure econet addresses via an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4160: An overflow in sendto() and recvfrom() routines was
fixed that could be used by local attackers to potentially crash the
kernel using some socket families like L2TP.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
