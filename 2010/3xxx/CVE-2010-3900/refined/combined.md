# Midori 0.2.5 Released!

![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2623034032315d5cf0bcf5e213ff5547?s=36&d=retro&r=g)

Just a few minutes ago, I received an email from Christian, the lead developer of Midori, letting me know that version 0.2.5 was just released. My instant reaction? “HOORAY!”

In case you hadn’t seen, I personally am a fan, and have set out discussing some of the [good and the bad of Midori](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/04/using-midori-024.html), and [comparing it with Chrome](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/05/chrome-vs-midori.html). While my conclusion has been that Midori is not quite a replacement primary browser, this is one step closer to a brilliant and modern full GTK browser (Yeah, Epiphany just doesn’t cut it. For me, at least). Lets look at some of the areas I’ve pointed out as weaknesses in the past.

**Interface**

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.twotoasts.de/media/validation.png?resize=320%2C222)](https://i0.wp.com/www.twotoasts.de/media/validation.png)

 While not much has changed in the interface, there are a few touch-ups that make me feel a bit more at home. SSL validation is now indicated in the location background color, as well as a fullscreen clock to keep users from loosing track of time. While there has not been much progression in the area of ease of customization of appearance, this is really a matter of implementation rather than feature, as there is already capability of customizing, just not in an easy drag and drop fashion. In addition, some small updates allow for better panel adaptation to system theme, and a new spinner widget! (Yes, I really am that excited about something so little. :D)

**Browsing**

Ease of browsing has been simplified in several ways. First of all, mouse gestures has been defaulted to right click, with possibility of changing back, and speed dial has been given the capability of responding to keyboard pushes.

**Extras**

First of all, as stated mouse gestures has been updated, as has colorful tabs, which now respond to the color of the icon in the tab. But bigger than little tiny changes, Vala support has been added for extensions. That is super awesome, and while there isn’t much built in available, experimental folk can get started on extending any which way they want.

You can read the full [announcement here](http://www.twotoasts.de/index.php?/archives/30-Validation,-vending-and-Vala.html), as well as getting the download tar, and the full [ChangeLog here](http://git.xfce.org/apps/midori/tree/ChangeLog).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

a lightweight, fast, and free web browser

⚠️ Midori Browser development happens on GitHub at <https://github.com/midori-browser/core>

Midori is a lightweight yet powerful web browser which runs just as well on little embedded computers named for delicious pastries as it does on beefy machines with a core temperature exceeding that of planet earth. And it looks good doing that, too. Oh, and of course it's free software.

Privacy out of the box:

• Adblock filter list support.

• Private browsing.

• Manage cookies and scripts.

Productivity features:

• Open a 1000 tabs instantly.

• Easy web apps creation.

• Customizable side panels.

• User scripts and styles a la Greasemonkey.

• Web developer tools powered by WebKit.

Any specific reason to only give CVE to epiphany if you want to start
giving CVEs for this kind of flaw?  IIRC, not long ago, no
WebKitGtk-based browser I tried verified server SSL certificates and
all connected without any complaint or indication that SSL certificate
was not verified.  None seemed to offer any configuration option to
enable certificate checking.  I guess there may be / was some
limitations on WebKitGtk side that can explain this.

I noticed midori now uses different address bar background color, which
seem to be similar to the epiphany fix described in the Debian bug.

Oh, now I see you're probably asking for CVE for post-deb#564690
behavior, not pre-deb#564690, right?

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
