=====================================================================
Description:
During an external pentest exercise for one of our clients, multiple
vulnerabilities and weaknesses were found on the Cisco CUVC-5110-HD10 which
allowed us to ultimately gain access to the internal network.
- - Hard-coded credentials - CVE-2010-3038
Three accounts have a login shell and a password the administrator can neither
disable nor change. The affected accounts are "root", "cs" and "develop".
Matta didn't spend the CPU cycles required to get those passwords but will
provide the salted hashes to interested parties. The credentials can be used
against both the FTP and the SSH daemon running on the device.
- - Services misconfiguration
There is an FTP daemon (vsftpd) running but no mention in the documentation
of what it might be useful for. User credentials created from the
web-interface allow to explore the filesystem/firmware of the device.
The file /etc/shadow has read permissions for all.
The ssh daemon (openssh) has a non-default but curious configuration. It
allows port-forwarding and socks proxies to be created, X11 to be
forwarded... even with the restricted shells.
The daemon binding the port of the web-interface is running as root.
- - Weak session IDs on the web interface
Session IDs are timestamps of when the user logged-in and are trivial to
forge. There are numerous ways of remotely gathering the remote time and
uptime, the easiest being to ask over RPC... Assuming that a user or an
administrator logged into the device shortly after it was powered up, and
that the network connectivity is fast, it is practical to bruteforce a
valid session id.
Using this vulnerability, a non-authenticated attacker can authenticate.
- - Usage of cookies to store credentials
Credentials to access the web interface are stored in base64 format in the
cookie sent by the browser. Over http in default configuration. While users
are not expected to reuse their credentials, in practice they do; this is
an information-disclosure bug.
- - Remote Command Injection on the web-interface - CVE-2010-3037
The script at /goform/websXMLAdminRequestCgi.cgi is vulnerable to remote
command injection (post authentication). Many parameters can be abused,
including but not limited to the "username" field. Obviously, as the
webserver is running as root, it can lead to complete compromise of the
device.
- - Weak obfuscation of credentials
The configuration file /opt/rv/Versions/CurrentVersion/Mcu/Config/Mcu.val
contains obfuscated passwords which are trivial to reveal. This is an
information-disclosure bug. Best practices recommend using PBKDF2 to store
passwords.
=====================================================================
Impact
If successful, a malicious third party can get full control of the device and
harvest user passwords with little to no effort. The Attacker might
reposition and launch an attack against other parts of the target
infrastructure from there.
=====================================================================
Versions affected:
Firmware version 7.0.1.13.3 tested. All deployed versions are probably
vulnerable.
=====================================================================
Threat mitigation
Until a patch is issued by the vendor, Matta recommends you unplug the
device from its network socket.
=====================================================================

Description:

During an external pentest exercise for one of our clients, multiple
 vulnerabilities and weaknesses were found on the  Cisco CUVC-5110-HD10 which
 allowed us to ultimately gain access to the internal network.

- - Hard-coded credentials - CVE-2010-3038

Three accounts have a login shell and a password the administrator can neither
 disable nor change. The affected accounts are "root", "cs" and "develop".
 Matta didn't spend the CPU cycles required to get those passwords but will
 provide the salted hashes to interested parties. The credentials can be used
 against both the FTP and the SSH daemon running on the device.

- - Services misconfiguration

There is an FTP daemon (vsftpd) running but no mention in the documentation
 of what it might be useful for. User credentials created from the
 web-interface allow to explore the filesystem/firmware of the device.

The file /etc/shadow has read permissions for all.

The ssh daemon (openssh) has a non-default but curious configuration. It
 allows port-forwarding and socks proxies to be created, X11 to be
 forwarded... even with the restricted shells.

The daemon binding the port of the web-interface is running as root.

- - Weak session IDs on the web interface

Session IDs are timestamps of when the user logged-in and are trivial to
 forge. There are numerous ways of remotely gathering the remote time and
 uptime, the easiest being to ask over RPC... Assuming that a user or an
 administrator logged into the device shortly after it was powered up, and
 that the network connectivity is fast, it is practical to bruteforce a
 valid session id.

Using this vulnerability, a non-authenticated attacker can authenticate.

- - Usage of cookies to store credentials

Credentials to access the web interface are stored in base64 format in the
 cookie sent by the browser. Over http in default configuration. While users
 are not expected to reuse their credentials, in practice they do; this is
 an information-disclosure bug.

- - Remote Command Injection on the web-interface - CVE-2010-3037

The script at /goform/websXMLAdminRequestCgi.cgi is vulnerable to remote
 command injection (post authentication). Many parameters can be abused,
 including but not limited to the "username" field. Obviously, as the

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
