This assumes both parties are communicating using X.25. The issue is located in `net/x25/x25_facilities.c`. The vulnerability was reported by Dan Rosenberg. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG are not affected because they do not include support for CCITT X.25 Packet Layer.",
