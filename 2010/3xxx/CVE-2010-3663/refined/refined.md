Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-3663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insecure default value of the `fileDenyPattern` configuration variable in TYPO3. This variable is intended to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded to the backend. The insecure default setting allows backend users to upload files with extensions like `.phtml`, which could be executed as PHP code under certain web server configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The primary vulnerability is the potential for arbitrary code execution due to the insufficiently restrictive `fileDenyPattern`.
*  **Insecure Default Configuration:** The core issue is the insecure default configuration of the  `fileDenyPattern` variable.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several instances of XSS vulnerabilities are mentioned, arising from insufficient sanitization of user inputs in the TYPO3 backend, Extension Manager, and frontend login.
*   **Open Redirection:** There are several instances of open redirection vulnerabilities in TYPO3, also caused by failing to sanitize user input.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Some backend record editing forms are vulnerable to SQL injections due to insufficient escaping of user inputs for database queries.
*   **Insecure Randomness:**  The session ID generation and the "forgot password" hash generation were using weak random number generation methods, making them susceptible to brute-force attacks, especially on Windows systems.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  TYPO3 reveals the complete path to the web root when a defective backend module is installed. Additionally, the TYPO3 HTML mailing API includes the exact version number of the TYPO3 installation in the mail header.
*   **Broken Authentication and Session Management:** The Install Tool authenticates users without invalidating a supplied session identifier, making it susceptible to session fixation attacks.
*   **Spam Abuse:** The native form content element is susceptible to spam abuse due to a lack of parameter validation.
*   **Header Injection:** The secure download feature (jumpurl) is vulnerable to header injection/manipulation because of insufficient sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the web server.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the backend pages, potentially stealing user session information or performing other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Open Redirection:**  Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
*  **SQL Injection:**  Attackers could gain access to sensitive database information.
*  **Insecure Randomness:** Session IDs and password reset hashes are vulnerable to brute force attacks, potentially allowing attackers to hijack sessions or reset user passwords.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The web root path and TYPO3 version number might be revealed to attackers.
*   **Broken Authentication and Session Management:** Attackers can hijack administrator sessions, potentially gaining complete control of the TYPO3 site.
*   **Spam Abuse:**  Attackers could abuse the form to send emails to arbitrary email addresses.
*   **Header Injection:**  Attackers can spoof the mime type of the downloaded file, possibly tricking users into downloading malicious files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The majority of the vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **Backend Access:** Some vulnerabilities require a valid backend user login.
*   **User Interaction:** Some attacks could require user interaction, such as clicking on a malicious link in the case of open redirection or XSS.
*   **Specific Configurations:** The arbitrary code execution vulnerability is dependent on web server configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the TYPO3 instance.
*   **Low Privileges:**  Some attacks, such as open redirection and XSS, can be executed by unauthenticated attackers. However, some attacks require a valid backend user login or even admin level access, for example, for uploading code.
*   **Knowledge of TYPO3:** A good understanding of TYPO3's backend and extension manager is required for exploiting some of the identified vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was addressed in TYPO3 versions 4.1.14, 4.2.13, 4.3.4, and 4.4.1.
* The fix involved implementing a more secure default value for the `fileDenyPattern` variable.
* Multiple security issues were bundled into TYPO3-SA-2010-012
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by multiple sources within the TYPO3 community

The provided content clearly indicates that the CVE-2010-3663 is related to an insecure default value in TYPO3 that allows for potential arbitrary code execution and other vulnerabilities.
