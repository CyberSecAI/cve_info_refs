Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Sleipnir and Grani, two web browsers, determine how to load executable files (.exe). Specifically, they use an unsafe file search path when displaying the source code of an HTML file. This allows the browsers to load executables from unintended locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure File Search Path:** The browsers do not properly validate or sanitize the path where they look for executables. This allows an attacker to place a malicious executable in a location where the browser will find it and load it.
*   **DLL Hijacking:** This issue is related to a broader class of vulnerabilities known as DLL hijacking, where an attacker can force an application to load a malicious DLL in place of a legitimate one. While the content specifically mentions executables (.exe), the underlying problem is related to the way the application searches for and loads external code libraries which can include dlls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's system with the same privileges as the user running the vulnerable application (Sleipnir or Grani). This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious HTML:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTML file that references a malicious executable. When the user views the source of this HTML file in the vulnerable browser, the browser loads the attacker-supplied executable.
*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network, meaning an attacker can distribute the malicious HTML via a website or phishing email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Create Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an HTML file to reference their malicious executable.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via the network.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to view the source code of a malicious HTML file for the vulnerability to be exploited. This could be achieved by tricking the user into visiting a malicious website, opening a malicious file, or clicking on a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Makoto Shiotsuki.
*   JPCERT/CC coordinated with the developer to resolve the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2010-3164.
*   The issue is related to a broader problem of insecure DLL loading in Windows applications, as indicated by references to US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#707943 and Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637.
*   The JVN iPedia entry for this vulnerability is JVNDB-2010-000048.

This vulnerability is rated as a "Medium" severity based on CVSS v2, but the analysis by JPCERT/CC shows it has high severity on Access and Authentication, requiring only a low level of user interaction and a high level of exploit complexity.

The vendor, Fenrir Inc., has released updates to address this vulnerability in Sleipnir and Grani.
