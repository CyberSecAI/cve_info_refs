| ``` Steps to reproduce the issue:  - in one shell run: "python -m smtpd -n" - in another one run: "for i in {1..1000};do nmap -sT -p 8025 localhost;done"  The server will print out the following output and just quit (DoS):  giampaolo@ubuntu:~/svn/python-2.7$ ./python -m smtpd -n  error: uncaptured python exception, closing channel <__main__.PureProxy listening localhost:8025 at 0xb74b0f4c> (<class 'socket.error'>:[Errno 107] Transport endpoint is not connected [/home/giampaolo/svn/python-2.7/Lib/asyncore.py|read|79] [/home/giampaolo/svn/python-2.7/Lib/asyncore.py|handle_read_event|430] [/home/giampaolo/svn/python-2.7/Lib/smtpd.py|handle_accept|296] [/home/giampaolo/svn/python-2.7/Lib/smtpd.py|__init__|124] [/home/giampaolo/svn/python-2.7/Lib/socket.py|meth|222]) giampaolo@ubuntu:~/svn/python-2.7$   This is due to [issue 6706](issue6706 "[closed] asyncore's accept() is broken"). ``` | | | |

| ``` It would be ideal to solve this issue in asyncore.py by fixing dispatcher.accept() once and for all, but I'm not sure whether this can be done in a fully retro-compatible way in terms of asyncore API.  Alternatively SMTPServer.handle_accept() can be fixed in the same way as pyftpdlib did: <http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/source/browse/tags/release-0.5.2/pyftpdlib/ftpserver.py#622>     def handle_accept(self)        try:             sock, addr = self.accept()         except TypeError:             # sometimes accept() might return None             return         except socket.error, err:             # ECONNABORTED might be thrown             if err[0] != errno.ECONNABORTED:                 raise             return         else:             # sometimes addr == None instead of (ip, port)             if addr == None:                 return ``` | | | |

| ``` Being not easy to patch asyncore in a retro-compatible way here's a patch for smtpd instead which can be applied to python 2.7, 3.1 and 3.2. Tested with nmap as shown in my first message on both Linux and FreeBSD and not exceptions are raised. ``` | | | |

What error happens in your case? Can you maybe provide a test case that shows this?

The test applies neither to the trunk nor the 3.6 branch.

There is an API mismatch regarding the database interface in your test case: db.conn() does not exist and db.open() works.

Also, your testcase says DB.conn() which I'm not sure was ever working.

Please try to provide a test case that works directly and try to make it work against a current version of the release branch you are referring to.

Christian,

I've updated the test case and still getting the same traceback.

Please note the problem is server side (zeo).

I'm using ZODB3.8b4.

Wich OS X version / python version are you using?

please note the problem is OS X specific AFAIK

Thanks

Are you using a system python. Can you try using a custom-compiled python?

I don't know that there's enough info here for the Python folks to

work on. Here's an explanation from a guy here at ZC:

"Setting the SO\_LINGER option to off on a socket means that when the

 socket is closed, the call returns immediately, and a TCP RST packet

 is sent to the peer.

Normally when a socket is closed it is handled gracefully, i.e., care

 is taken that all outstanding packets have been received, and a TCP

 FIN packet is sent.

In a way this is a race condition. In Mac OS X, the sockaddr struct

 must be deallocated as soon as a RST packet is received (causing

 accept to return None). This may only happen if the RST packet is

 sent close enough to the initial TCP handshake."

It sounds like the implementation of socket.accept should check this

condition.

ZEO has a broader problem, with a broader solution, that it isn't

proprtly handling exceptions raised in it's application-level accept

logic.

Interestingly, I can't repoduce the symptom reported in this issue,

although I get a result, for ZEO, that is just as bad. The ZEO server

stops accepting new connections.

This is for Python maintainers, if anyone is paying attention. :)

I was able to reproduce this problem with Python 2.6 on Mac OS X 10.6.

I've attached a demonstration script, 135108.py.

Run it with a "server" argument:

python2.6 135108.py server

In a separate shell, run it with a client argument:

python2.6 135108.py client

On my mac, this causes the server to print None and exit,

demonstrating that that accept returned None, when it probably should

have done something else. :)

Bonus:

If getpeername is called on the returned socket, [Errno 22] Invalid

argument is raised, rather than errno.ENOTCONN, which is what asyncore

expects. :)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Steve,

I'm going to leave this one up to you. While it's really a python bug, I
suspect several affected projects will end up patching themselves (I'm not
sure how MITRE hadnles this situation).

Thanks.

Subject: CVE Request -- Python -- accept() implementation in async core is
 broken => more subcases

Hello Steve, vendors,

   Giampaolo Rodola reported a deficiency in the implementation of Python's accept() routine:
   [1] <http://bugs.python.org/issue6706>

   The following seems to be all symptoms for the same issue:
   A, SMTP (smtpd.py):
      [2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=632200>
      [3] <http://bugs.python.org/issue9129>

   B, pyftpdlib:
      [4] <http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/issues/detail?id=104>

   C, ZODB:
      [5] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/135108](https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/%2Bbug/135108)

   D, more?

Not sure, how to proceed in this case:
i,  if assign only one CVE id for [1] or,
ii, assign also separate CVE ids for the child symptoms? ([2], [3], [4])

Cc-ed David Malcom on this post, to shed more light how to handle this case.

Once the way, how to further proceed with this, specified. Steve could you allocate CVE id (ids)?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

| ``` An old bad design choice in asyncore is how it forces the user to  override handle_accept() and then call self.accept() to obtain a socket  pair.      def handle_accept(self):         conn, addr = self.accept()  The documentation itself shows the code above as an example of how an  asyncore-based server should handle an incoming connection. What the doc doesn't say is that the user calling self.accept() is  exposed to different risks:  - self.accept() can return None instead of a socket pair in which case  TypeError is raised (see pyftpdlib bug:  <http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/issues/detail?id=91>)  - ECONNABORTED can be raised. This is reproducible on Linux by hammering  the server with nmap (see pyftpdlib bug:  <http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/issues/detail?id=105>)  - EAGAIN can be raised too. I never experienced this error condition  myself in pyftpdlib but by looking at twisted/internet/tcp.py it seems  reasonable to catch EAGAIN too.  - The resulting address can be None, which means that the connection  didn't take place. This is reproducible by hammering the server with nmap (see pyftpdlib  bug <http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/issues/detail?id=104>).   The right thing to do when one of such events occur is to "return" as no  connection has really been established between client and server.  Now, altough handling these kind of conditions is quite easy, the API  design remains fundamentally wrong, as it forces the user to call  accept(). As asyncore.py is structured right now the only chance the user has to  properly accepting a connection is manually handling all these cases in  his subclass.   My patch in attachment tries to solve this problem by defining a new  "handle_accept_event()" method which takes care of all the error  conditions described above resulting in handle_accept() be called *only  when a connection really took place*. When the connection is established handle_accept_event() stores the  socket pair as an attribute and the next call to accept() returns that  pair. This preserves the current implementation without breaking any code as  the user will have to override handle_accept() and then call accept() in  the same manner [1], with the difference that self.accept() will always  return a valid socket pair.  [1]      def handle_accept(self):         conn, addr = self.accept() ``` | | | |

As for tests, ECONN and EAGAIN error conditions are hardly reproducible unless you're using nmap. I'm assigning this to me for now as a reminder and update the issue as long as I have a working patch. ``` | | | |

| ``` giampaolo: did you ever rewrite the patch?  For reference to other users: <http://code.google.com/p/pyftpdlib/source/browse/trunk/pyftpdlib/ftpserver.py>  Note the complexity of the two handle_accept implementations in that file; both of them begin:         try:             sock, addr = self.accept()         except TypeError:             # sometimes accept() might return None (see issue 91)             return         except socket.error, err:             # ECONNABORTED might be thrown on *BSD (see issue 105)             if err[0] != errno.ECONNABORTED:                 logerror(traceback.format_exc())             return         else:             # sometimes addr == None instead of (ip, port) (see issue 104)             if addr == None:                 return ``` | | | |

| ``` Here's a rewriting attempt (not tested). Now that I look at it I must say it's quite ugly, so I don't think we should follow this road. An alternative I see is to return None in case of errors occurring on accept() and make this very clear in doc.  Other than accept(), doc should explicitly show how to use handle_accept() in general, which would end up looking like this:  class SomeServer(asyncore.dispatcher):          ...      def handle_accept():        conn = self.accept()        if conn is None:            return        else:            sock, addr = conn        ...      ...   A completely different approach could be to provide a new "TCPServer" class which deprecates direct accept() method usage. Something like this:   class TCPServer(asyncore.dispatcher):      def __init__(self, ip, port, handler, interface='', map=None):         asyncore.dispatcher.__init__(self, map=map)         self.create_socket(family=socket.AF_INET, type=socket.SOCK_STREAM)         self.bind((ip, port))         self.listen(5)         self.handler = handler      def handle_accept(self):         try:             sock, addr = self.accept()         except TypeError:             return         except socket.error, err:             if err[0] != errno.ECONNABORTED:                 raise             return         else:             if addr == None:                 return         handler = self.handler(conn, self._map)      def writable(self):         return 0    ...but for some reason I don't like it either. Point is asyncore API design is fundamentally wrong and there's nothing we can do about it unless we break backward compatibility or a brand new "asyncore2" module is written. ``` | | | |

| ``` > EAGAIN can be raised too. I never experienced this error condition  > myself in pyftpdlib  From the accept() man page:  EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK               The  socket  is  marked  nonblocking and no connections are present to be accepted.               POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this case, and does not require               these  constants to have the same value, so a portable application should check for               both possibilities.  > The resulting address can be None, which means that the connection  > didn't take place.

| ``` > I'm not convinced hiding operating system bugs is a good idea.  Do you propose to let the error raise then? The point of frameworks such as asyncore and twisted is to hide all system-specific errors as much as possible and provide a portable interface across all platforms. AFAICT, the whole point of this issue is that there should be only one way for an asyncore-based server to accept an incoming connection, possibly avoiding the user to deal with low-level details such as catching EWOULDBLOCK/ECONNABORTED/... in his application, and looking for accept() returning None is one possibility.  As I said, in a better designed framework the user shouldn't be supposed to call accept() at all, but that's how asyncore is designed. ``` | | | |

As long as these errors are reasonably explainable. If a strange error only occurs when running nmap on an OS X server, then it might be useful for the user to know that the OS X server isn't able to service all connections properly due to a bug in the operating system.  > AFAICT, the whole point of this issue is that there should be only one > way for an asyncore-based server to accept an incoming connection, > possibly avoiding the user to deal with low-level details such as > catching EWOULDBLOCK/ECONNABORTED/...  I am talking specifically about the address being None (i.e., a (sock, None) tuple is successfully returned). EWOULDBLOCK and ECONNABORTED are documented error conditions for accept(), but returning 0 in addrlen is not.  > As I said, in a better designed framework the user shouldn't be > supposed to call accept() at all, but that's how asyncore is designed.  Perhaps it's time to add an alternative handle_accepted(sock, addr) which relieves the user from calling accept() :)) Then, perhaps self.accept() shouldn't filter any errors at all, but the default handle_accept() would silence them before calling handle_accepted(). ``` | | | |

It might be useful to find whether this is tracked somewhere. For the record, here (comment #10) is a code which should reproduce this problem: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/+bug/135108](https://bugs.launchpad.net/zodb/%2Bbug/135108) As for what asyncore should in this case I think it should theoretically be safe for accept() to return (sock, None). What usually happen after that is that the socket object is passed to another dispatcher subclass (the handler) and the connection gets automatically closed once recv() or send() get called on the next async-loop.  > Perhaps it's time to add an alternative handle_accepted(sock, addr) > which relieves the user from calling accept() :))  This sounds like a very good idea for 3.2. As for 3.1 and 2.7 (2.6?) I think it can be useful to suppress EWOULDBLOCK/ECONNABORTED and return None instead. Considering accept() can *already* return None it wouldn't break backward compatibility. ``` | | | |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-1596-1: Python 2.6 vulnerabilities

4 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.6.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python2.6](/security/cves?package=python2.6) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

"""An RFC 5321 smtp proxy with optional RFC 1870 and RFC 6531 extensions.

Usage: %(program)s [options] [localhost:localport [remotehost:remoteport]]

Options:

    --nosetuid
    -n
        This program generally tries to setuid `nobody', unless this flag is
        set.  The setuid call will fail if this program is not run as root (in
        which case, use this flag).

    --version
    -V
        Print the version number and exit.

    --class classname
    -c classname
        Use `classname' as the concrete SMTP proxy class.  Uses `PureProxy' by
        default.

    --size limit
    -s limit
        Restrict the total size of the incoming message to "limit" number of
        bytes via the RFC 1870 SIZE extension.  Defaults to 33554432 bytes.

    --smtputf8
    -u
        Enable the SMTPUTF8 extension and behave as an RFC 6531 smtp proxy.

    --debug
    -d
        Turn on debugging prints.

    --help
    -h
        Print this message and exit.

Version: %(__version__)s

If localhost is not given then `localhost' is used, and if localport is not
given then 8025 is used.  If remotehost is not given then `localhost' is used,
and if remoteport is not given, then 25 is used.
"""

# Overview:
#
# This file implements the minimal SMTP protocol as defined in RFC 5321.  It
# has a hierarchy of classes which implement the backend functionality for the
# smtpd.  A number of classes are provided:
#
#   SMTPServer - the base class for the backend.  Raises NotImplementedError
#   if you try to use it.
#
#   DebuggingServer - simply prints each message it receives on stdout.
#
#   PureProxy - Proxies all messages to a real smtpd which does final
#   delivery.  One known problem with this class is that it doesn't handle
#   SMTP errors from the backend server at all.  This should be fixed
#   (contributions are welcome!).
#
#   MailmanProxy - An experimental hack to work with GNU Mailman
#   <www.list.org>.  Using this server as your real incoming smtpd, your
#   mailhost will automatically recognize and accept mail destined to Mailman
#   lists when those lists are created.  Every message not destined for a list
#   gets forwarded to a real backend smtpd, as with PureProxy.  Again, errors
#   are not handled correctly yet.
#
#
# Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
#
# TODO:
#
# - support mailbox delivery
# - alias files
# - Handle more ESMTP extensions
# - handle error codes from the backend smtpd

        socket connection to our smtp port.

        mailfrom is the raw address the client claims the message is coming
        from.

        rcpttos is a list of raw addresses the client wishes to deliver the
        message to.

        data is a string containing the entire full text of the message,
        headers (if supplied) and all.  It has been `de-transparencied'
        according to RFC 821, Section 4.5.2.  In other words, a line
        containing a `.' followed by other text has had the leading dot
        removed.

        kwargs is a dictionary containing additional information.  It is
        empty if decode_data=True was given as init parameter, otherwise
        it will contain the following keys:
            'mail_options': list of parameters to the mail command.  All

            'rcpt_options': same, for the rcpt command.

Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Python -- accept() implementation
 in async core is broken => more subcases

On Wed, 22 Sep 2010, Josh Bressers wrote:

This was a weird one to deal with.  There are a couple different
approaches.

We don't capture API "design limitations" in CVE (it would basically be
like assigning a CVE to "strcpy can be called with parameters that are
longer than the output buffer" or "setuid requires that the programmer
must check the return code to ensure that privileges were dropped.")

In this case, there is a "proper" way to handle the accept() behavior;
i.e. by catching the appropriate exceptions and accounting for an unusual
return value, the programmer can use the API safely.  That would argue for
treating it like strcpy/setuid/etc. design limitations, and holding
application programmers "responsible" for using it incorrectly.

However, there isn't some security-relevant documentation about these
specific API limitations.  So, a CVE could be assigned for the missing
documentation; alternately, we could treat it as "undocumented behavior"
in the API.  (This wouldn't be the first CVE related to documentation.)

Then, individual programs that happen to use the unpatched/older Pythons
can be held responsible for not accounting for this; similar to how we
"blame" applications for allowing XSS due to some non-standard
implementations within Internet Explorer, or Firefox, etc.

So:

CVE-2010-3492 - Python poor documentation of accept() behavior

CVE-2010-3493 - smtpd.py not catching errors generated by handle_accept

CVE-2010-3494 - pyftpdlib not catching errors generated by handle_accept

CVE-2010-3495 - ZODB not catching errors generated by handle_accept

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=632200#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-09-09 12:01:09 UTC  ``` A race condition was found in the way Python's SMTP proxy module (smtpd.py) processed retrieving of remote IP  address the socket was connected to (the other end  could close the connection sooner before the requester  could get the peername). A remote, unauthenticated user  could use this flaw to cause the running python SMTP  instance to terminate with uncaught exception by  issuing sequence of connection requests within short  time interval.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.4](/security/cves?package=python2.4) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.4)

## Details

USN-1613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Python 2.5. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Python 2.4.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [python2.4-minimal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4)
  -
  [2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4/2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4)
* [python2.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4)
  -
  [2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.4/2.4.5-1ubuntu4.4)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))
