How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <4C83E266.3050803@redhat.com>
Date: Sun, 05 Sep 2010 20:33:10 +0200

Subject: CVE Request -- EncFS / fuse-encfs [three ids] -- Multiple Vulnerabilities
 in EncFS

Hello Steve, vendors,

   Micha Riser reported:
   [A] <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2010-08/0316.html>

three security flaws in EncFS encrypted filesystem (more from [A]):

"A security analysis of EncFS has revealed multiple vulnerabilities:
(1) Only 32 bit of file IV used
(2) Watermarking attack
(3) Last block with single byte is insecure"

References:
   [B] <http://www.arg0.net/encfs>
   [C] <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335938>
   [D] <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2010-08/att-0316/watermark-attack-encfs.tar.gz>
   [E] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=630460>

Solutions / patches information:
================================

* for issue (1) -- seems it wasn't fixed / isn't possible to
   fix without breaking backward compatibility. More from [B]:

   "The old IV setup is kept for backwards compatibility."

* for issue (2) -- EncFS upstream has released a fix for the issue:
   [F] <http://code.google.com/p/encfs/source/detail?r=59>

Valient, could you please confirm, the above referenced [F] patch,
is the correct one to address the watermarking attack issue?

* for issue (3) -- not sure about patch status (included in [F] too?)

Steve, could you allocate CVE ids for these flaws?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml documents could crash applications linked
against libxml2 (CVE-2010-4008).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- tomboy
The tomboy startup scripts put empty elements in LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
causing tomboy to load shared libraries from the current directory
(CVE-2010-4005).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit
that to modify or forge messages
(CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020, CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- php5
Insufficient handling of certain character sequences in the
utf8\_decode() function could be leveraged to conduct
cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2010-3870).
php5 could also consume large amounts of memory and crash if a long
mail address was passed to filter\_var() with parmeter
FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL (CVE-2010-3710).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- cups
- CVE-2010-3702: Specially crafted PDF files could crash pdftops or
potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code.
- CVE-2010-2941: Specially crafted IPP requests could crash cupsd
- CVE-2010-0542: A NULL pointer dereference in the \_WriteProlog()
function of the texttops image filter.
- CVE-2010-1748: An attacker with access to the web-interface may be
able to read some bytes of uninitialized memory.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Untrusted applets could read values of restricted system properties
(CVE-2010-3860).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- epiphany
Epiphany does not support verification of ssl certificates. It
nevertheless displayed all https connections as secure
(CVE-2010-3312).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2
- encfs
- CVE-2010-3073: encfs only used 32bits for the IV
- CVE-2010-3074: encfs was prone to a watermarking attack
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

Jan,

Yes, the patch referenced in [F],  specifically changes to SSL_Cipher.cpp, were made in response to issues (1) & (2).  These are not backward compatible, and so only apply to new filesystems.

Issue (3) is not directly addressed.  A workaround is to enable per-block MAC headers, or per-block random bytes.  A patch going into 1.7.2 allows per-block random bytes to be configured independently of MAC headers.  It would be possible to change the default settings such that per-block random bytes are always used.

Adding new encryption modes is not planned for encfs 1.x.

regards,
Valient

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
