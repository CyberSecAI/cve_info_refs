# USN-1004-1: Django vulnerability

13 October 2010

Django could be made to insert arbitrary content into web forms.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

It was discovered that Django did not properly sanitize the cookie value

when applying CSRF protections resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS)

vulnerability. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were

tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a

remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal

confidential data, within the same domain.

## Security release issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on Sept. 8, 2010

Today the Django team is issuing a new release -- Django 1.2.2 -- to remedy a security issue reported to us. This issue was disclosed independently by two different parties, and all users of Django 1.2 are urged to upgrade immediately.

### Description of issue

As of the 1.2 release, the core Django framework includes a system,
enabled by default, for detecting and preventing cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) attacks against Django-powered applications. Previous
Django releases provided a different, optionally-enabled system for
the same purpose.

The Django 1.2 CSRF protection system involves the generation of a
random token, inserted as a hidden field in outgoing forms. The same
value is also set in a cookie, and the cookie value and form value are
compared on submission.

The provided template tag for inserting the CSRF token into forms --
`{% csrf_token %}` -- explicitly trusts the cookie value, and
displays it as-is. Thus, an attacker who is able to tamper with the
value of the CSRF cookie can cause arbitrary content to be inserted,
unescaped, into the outgoing HTML of the form, enabling cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks.

This issue was first reported via a public ticket in Django's Trac
instance; while being triaged it was then independently reported, with
broader description, by Jeff Balogh of Mozilla.

### Affected versions

* Django development trunk
* Django 1.2

Because the current CSRF-protection system is new as of Django 1.2,
older releases are unaffected.

### Resolution

Patches have been applied to Django trunk and to the 1.2 release branch to ensure the cookie value is never trusted and is always escaped. Future Django releases may migrate away from the use of a dedicated cookie to avoid the possibility of such issues.

Patches may be obtained directly from the appropriate changesets:

* Django trunk: [Changeset 13698](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/13698)
* Django 1.2: [Changeset 13699](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/13699)

The following release has been issued:

* Django 1.2.2 ([download](http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.2.2/tarball/) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.2.2.checksum.txt))

### General notes regarding security

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via private email to `security@djangoproject.com`, and not via Django's Trac instance or the django-developers list.

Due to the time-sensitive nature of this issue, our normal process of advance notification of distributors of Django was not followed; notification to distributors was sent just prior to issuance of this release. If you are or represent a third-party distributor of Django and did not receive a notification email from the Django release manager, please contact `james@b-list.org`.

This was just pointed out to me:

<http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2010/sep/08/security-release/>

"""
The provided template tag for inserting the CSRF token into forms -- {% csrf_token %} \
-- explicitly trusts the cookie value, and displays it as-is. Thus, an attacker who \
is able to tamper with the value of the CSRF cookie can cause arbitrary content to be \
inserted, unescaped, into the outgoing HTML of the form, enabling cross-site \
scripting (XSS) attacks. """

Please use CVE-2010-3082

Thanks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=632239#c0)  Josh Bressers    2010-09-09 13:43:06 UTC  ``` As of the 1.2 release, the core Django framework includes a system, enabled by default, for detecting and preventing cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against Django-powered applications. Previous Django releases provided a different, optionally-enabled system for the same purpose.  The Django 1.2 CSRF protection system involves the generation of a random token, inserted as a hidden field in outgoing forms. The same value is also set in a cookie, and the cookie value and form value are compared on submission.  The provided template tag for inserting the CSRF token into forms -- {% csrf_token %} -- explicitly trusts the cookie value, and displays it as-is. Thus, an attacker who is able to tamper with the value of the CSRF cookie can cause arbitrary content to be inserted, unescaped, into the outgoing HTML of the form, enabling cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  This issue was first reported via a public ticket in Django's Trac instance; while being triaged it was then independently reported, with broader description, by Jeff Balogh of Mozilla.  <http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2010/sep/08/security-release/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=632239#c1)  Josh Bressers    2010-09-09 13:43:40 UTC  ``` Created Django tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 632240](show_bug.cgi?id=632240 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3082 Django CSRF flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=632239#c2)  Steve Milner    2010-09-22 14:01:18 UTC  ``` Most all of the updates have made it out -- there was a follow up release which happened while the packages were in testing which pushed the releases out a bit. The only outstanding package is for Fedora 14 which is pending to go to stable.   ``` |  |
