Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-3082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Django framework's CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism, introduced in version 1.2, improperly handles the CSRF cookie value. The template tag `{% csrf_token %}` directly trusts and renders the cookie value without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. By manipulating the CSRF cookie value, an attacker can inject arbitrary, unescaped HTML into the web form's HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various attacks such as:
    - **Data theft:** Stealing cookies or other sensitive information from the victim's browser.
    - **Content modification:** Altering the content displayed on the page.
    - **Session hijacking:** Impersonating the victim on the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires the user to be tricked into visiting a malicious site or a crafted link that manipulates the CSRF cookie value.
- The attacker would need to be able to control or tamper with the CSRF cookie.
- The attacker then induces the user to view server output during a crafted server request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker does not need direct access to the server.
- The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the victim's browser to set a specific cookie value.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim into visiting the malicious URL or interact with a crafted request.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Django 1.2 and development trunk. Older versions that used a different CSRF protection system are not affected.
- Patches were issued for Django trunk and the 1.2 release branch.
- The fix involves escaping the cookie value before rendering it in the HTML output.
- Django 1.2.2 was released to address this issue.
- Ubuntu also released a fix in the `python-django` package `1.2.3-1ubuntu0.1` for Ubuntu 10.10.
