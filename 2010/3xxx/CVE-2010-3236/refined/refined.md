Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a memory handling error in Microsoft Excel when validating record information upon opening a specially crafted Excel file. Specifically, this CVE is categorized as an "Out Of Bounds Array Vulnerability".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds array access:  Excel improperly handles the parsing of certain records in a specially crafted file, leading to out-of-bounds access to memory. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the logged-in user.
- Complete System Control:  An attacker can gain full control of the system, enabling them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email: An attacker can send a malicious Excel file as an email attachment and trick the user into opening it.
- Web-based attacks: An attacker can host a malicious Excel file on a website, and trick the victim into visiting the site and opening the file. This may involve luring victims through links in email/instant messages or by compromising legitimate websites or ad networks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted Excel file that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to deliver the file to the victim, which can be done through email or by hosting the file on a website the victim will visit.
- The attacker must convince the user to open the file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in multiple versions of Microsoft Excel, including Excel 2002, 2003, 2004 for Mac and 2008 for Mac. It also affects the Open XML File Format Converter for Mac.
- The severity is rated as "Important"
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the Excel file.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed and there were no reports of active exploitation at the time the security bulletin was released.
- Mitigation includes not opening files from untrusted sources.
- Workarounds involve using File Block policy or the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE).
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates record information.
- This CVE is addressed as part of a larger patch (MS10-080) fixing multiple vulnerabilities.
