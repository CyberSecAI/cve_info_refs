    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application loads the 'ibfs32.dll' library from an insecure location, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL with the same name in a higher-priority directory, which gets loaded instead of the legitimate library.",

      ],
      "impact": "Execution of arbitrary code by loading a malicious DLL. This could lead to complete system compromise if the attackerâ€™s DLL is sufficiently malicious.",

        "Local file system manipulation"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to place a malicious 'ibfs32.dll' file in a location where the application will load it, before it loads the correct library. This could be the application's directory or another location in the DLL search order.",
      "more_info": "The exploit code provides a basic example of a malicious DLL. It displays a message box to confirm successful hijacking."
