  "CVE-2010-3170": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way NSS matched SSL certificates when the certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP address. NSS incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that fell within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections, possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `cert_TestHostName` function in NSS did not properly check if a name was an IP address before performing wildcard matching.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper matching of SSL certificate's common name when it contains a wildcard and a partial IP address.",
        "Lack of proper validation of IP addresses in certificate common names."
      ],
      "impact": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, allowing attackers to intercept and potentially manipulate communications.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By presenting a crafted SSL certificate with a common name containing a wildcard and a partial IP address that matches the victim's server IP.",
         "Connecting to a vulnerable server with a browser that accepts this certificate type."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create a malicious SSL certificate, ability to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, control a server that matches the remainder of the IP address of the target"
