1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- NetworkManager
dbus-glib allowed local users to write properties that were exported
read-only via dbus (CVE-2010-1172).
Affected Products: SLE11
- bind
A DoS vulnerability in bind's DNSSEC code has been
fixed which occured while recursively validating a server.
CVE-2010-0213 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- clamav
clamav version 0.96.3 fixes problems when scanning pdf files
(CVE-2010-3434) and also contains numerous other bug fixes.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- dovecot12
dovecot granted admin rights to all owner mailboxes (CVE-2010-3706).
When using multiple ACL entries for mailboxes the most specific one
was not always applied (CVE-2010-3707).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- festival
festival\_server uses an unsafe LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. Local users could exploit
that to execute code as another user if that user runs festival\_server.
CVE-2010-3996 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- gpg2
GnuPG2 was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by context-dependent
attackers because of reusing a freed pointer when verifying a signature
or importing a certificate with many "Subject Alternate Names".
(CVE-2010-2547)
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.0
- libfreebl3
The Mozilla NSS Library was updated to version 3.12.8 and the Mozilla
NSPR Library was updated to 4.8.6 to fix various bugs and one security
issue.
CVE-2010-3170: Disallow wildcard matching in X509 certificate Common
Names.
This update also has preparations for Firefox 4 support, and a updated
Root Certificate Authority list.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- php5-pear-mail
Passing specially crafted $from and $recepient arguments to
php5-pear-mail's sendmail.php allowed attackers to inject shell
code (CVE-2009-4023, CVE-2009-4111).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- postgresql
PostgreSQL functions implemented in Perl or TCL shared a global state
even across different user user ids. A user could therefore influence
functions of other users in an unexpected or even malicious way
(CVE-2010-3433).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

seamonkey security update (RHSA-2010-0781)

Original Release Date: October 28, 2010

Last Revised: October 28, 2010

Number: ASA-2010-302

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2010-3176](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3176.html) and
[CVE-2010-3180](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3180.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in SeaMonkey converted text
into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
a victim running SeaMonkey, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in
the context of the Gopher domain. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3177](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3177.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the script that launches SeaMonkey. The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
SeaMonkey, if that user ran SeaMonkey from within an attacker-controlled
directory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3182.html) to this issue.

It was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode
implementation for key exchanges in SeaMonkey accepted DHE keys that were
256 bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as
such keys are easily broken using modern hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3173](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3173.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey matched SSL certificates when the
certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
address. SeaMonkey incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that
fell within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3170](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3170.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0781.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with seamonkey installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update can be installed.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Not yet certain if this is an NSS issue or PSM issue. Maybe both?
I'm intentionally giving this bug a higher severity than it probably
deserves, given that CAs trusted by Mozilla won't issue such certs.
Received an email today from Richard Moore <rich@kde.org>. Text as follows:

> releasing at some point in the future. We aim to work with vendors to
> achieve simultaneous disclosure, so any comments would be appreciated.

After this gets fixed, we should have a brainstorming session about other potential combinations of creative wildcard usage and test our behaviour.

I set up a test site on my server.
- create a new firefox profile for testing purposes (firefox -P)
- go to <http://kuix.de/ca/nss-test-ca.php>
- install and trust the CA for web sites
Now you can perform the actual tests.
- go to <https://kuix.de:9447>
cert not accepted. We're fine. Firefox reports:
kuix.de:9447 uses an invalid security certificate.
The certificate is only valid for \*.106.189.147
(Error code: ssl\_error\_bad\_cert\_domain)
- go to <https://87.106.189.147:9447/>
cert is accepted

OK. NSS function CERT\_VerifyCertName, which is the function called by
PSM to see if a host name (or IP address) given by PSM matches a cert, has two major code paths, one for Subject Alt Names, and one for Subject Common Names.
See
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/security/nss/lib/certdb/certdb.c&rev=1.104&mark=1851,1856,1877,1881-1883#1851>
The path for SubjectAltNames has an explicit test to see if the desired
"host name" passed in by the caller from the "URI" is really an IP address.
It calls cert\_VerifySubjectAltName, which calls PR\_StringToNetAddr to make that determination. See
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/security/nss/lib/certdb/certdb.c&rev=1.104&mark=1510-1511,1537#1510>
It will not treat the caller's name as a DNS name if this function says it is an IP address.
But when the certificate does not have a subjectAltName, in the path for a Subject Common Name, there is no test to see if the name passed in by the caller is an IP address. In this case, CERT\_VerifyCertName calls CERT\_GetCommonName to get the CommonName, then calls cert\_TestHostName to test it. See
<https://mxr.mozilla.org/security/source/security/nss/lib/certdb/certdb.c#1446>
This new function makes no check for IP addresses (v4 or v6). It should. I'm adding the co-contributor of that code to the cc list of this bug.
I can imagine multiple solutions. But I think the simplest and best is this:
cert\_TestHostName can detect an IP address, and if found, can call
PORT\_SetError(SSL\_ERROR\_BAD\_CERT\_DOMAIN);
return SECFailure;
simply refusing to match an IP address against ANY string in a common name. That's what several other browsers do now. I think it's the right thing.

NSS has two separate functions that test the cert's embedded identifier against the active network target:
- cert\_TestHostName
- cert\_VerifySubjectAltName
cert\_VerifySubjectAltName has some logic for looking at IP addresses.
But cert\_TestHostName doesn't bother at all.
Shouldn't we have a single hostname verification function, that gets used for both "common names" and "alt subject names"?

This is a NSS bug.
The culprit is cert\_TestHostName

| [Comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=578697#c6)• 15 years ago |
|  | |

One undesirable characteristic of my proposed solution in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=578697#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Browser Wildcard Certificate Validation Issue") is that
it would cause each host name passed in by the caller (PSM) to be checked at
least twice, and maybe multiple times, when the cert has an SAN with a DNS
name. This is because cert\_VerifySubjectAltName calls cert\_TestHostName once
for each DNS name entry in the SAN, after having done the IP address check
once itself. I agree. That's bad.
The solution is to NOT check the host name to see if it's an IP address INSIDE
cert\_TestHostName, but rather to make it a requirement of the callers of
cert\_TestHostName that they must not call it with an IP address for the host
name. cert\_VerifySubjectAltName already takes care of this for the SAN path.
It's easy for CERT\_VerifyCertName to handle this for the CN path.

I have not yet looked at Kai's first patch.
My Alternative B is closest in behavior to existing behavior.
If a cert subject common name bears a string that looks like a dotted
decimal IP address, and it exactly matches the dotted decimal IP address
given in the URI, it will be accepted as a match. This is least likely
to break backward compatibility. It is also losing favor with the IETF
and with other browsers.
My alternative C is similar, but it will NOT match any IP address string
in a URL with an IP address string in a common name in a cert. It will ONLY
match an IP address in the URI with an IP address in a cert SubjectAltName.
This is what some other browsers do, but is quite different from what NSS
has done in the past and is MUCH more likely to be viewed as a break of
backward binary compatibility.
Both of these patches modify CERT\_VerifyCertName. The reason for this is
explained in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=578697#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Browser Wildcard Certificate Validation Issue"). I will read Kai's patch later this evening.

Nit: the variable name should be isIPAddr, for consistecy
with how "IPAddr" is spelled in the function name.

I thinking fixing bugs and dropping features should be done in separate steps, or you make it harder for consumers of NSS to accept new NSS releases as security fixes.
In particular to this functionality, I had recently asked about it on the newsgroup, and Nelson had confirmed the practice of having a cert for an IP address is an allowed practice.
<http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.security.policy/msg/88cc3b45d6b33bda>
The discussion about dropping support for IP address in common names is happening in [bug 553754](/show_bug.cgi?id=553754 "NEW - Stop honoring string representations of IP addresses in all cert fields from which we take DNS names") and seems to be open, someone has argued that some users might rely on that feature.
If you decide to really drop support for IP addresses, I propose to announce your decision in [bug 553754](/show_bug.cgi?id=553754 "NEW - Stop honoring string representations of IP addresses in all cert fields from which we take DNS names").
This change will affect stable branches of Mozilla products, who might prefer a bugfix without the feature drop?

If we start rejecting IP addresses as cert matches would it be an error that users (or PSM) could set up a cert override for? Or would it be a hard error? I think SSL\_ERROR\_BAD\_CERT\_DOMAIN is the standard name mismatch error and assume it would be overrideable, in which case I'm fine taking this (version B or C) on the stable branches. version C seems best going forward, might as well only change it once.
From Kai's patch
/\* replace all wildcards with zero \*/
Are multiple wildcards allowed? I know we used to allow all kinds of crazy RegExp stuff but I thought the spec required the wildcard to be the leftmost token.

Taking a wild-assed guess at sg-severity "moderate" since it allows SSL spoofing (normally "high") but only in the case of stupid sites using raw IP addresses as links. And where they're getting the CA that issues those I don't know. Presumably the target site uses a corporate CA but I don't know where the attacker gets a working wildcard cert that the victim will accept.blocking1.9.1: --- → ?blocking1.9.2: --- → ?blocking2.0: --- → ?

For the sake of completeness: cert\_TestHostName isn't really a new function, it was already added in 2002 ([bug 103752](/show_bug.cgi?id=103752 "RESOLVED FIXED - add support for multiple hostnames in an SSL server certificate")). It was modified last year, though, when we limited the "power" of the wildcard character ([bug 159483](/show_bug.cgi?id=159483 "RESOLVED FIXED - cert name matching: RFC 2818 vs. backwards compatibility (wildcards)")) so that it would no longer match a dot etc. With the old behavior (which can also be restored through the NSS\_USE\_SHEXP\_IN\_CERT\_NAME environment variable), things like CN=\*, or even CN=\*.\*.\*.\* have always been working for IP addresses, too.

I agree, and would therefore suggest to go with alternative B, for the time being.

We don't need the isIPaddr local variable. We can just do

PRBool is a typedef for 'int', so no type casting is necessary.

Alternative patch B, v0.1
Re: the nit on the variable name isIPaddr:
I see that isIPaddr comes from the existing function
cert\_VerifySubjectAltName. In that case, we should
just use the same name for consistency.
It is a shame that CERT\_VerifyCertName may call
PR\_StringToNetAddr twice. But I don't see a clean
way to call PR\_StringToNetAddr only once. Since
Common Name is being deprecated for certificate
name matching, I think adding a second
PR\_StringToNetAddr call for Common Name is fine.

Multiple wildcards are not allowed, furthermore the wildcard must be part of the first element. This is one of the reasons I regarded the risk as low in my original report. In code that uses the old style shell glob the risk is much higher, but fortunately we are no longer in that situation.

In my day job, I do see client sites that use raw IP addresses as links (and use SSL) - note i'm not saying this is sensible. I have little faith that the CA validation is stricter than that in browsers (and we can see the result there), which is one of the reasons I think this issue is important. That said, given that I haven't actually tried to get a CA to sign such a certificate maybe they are better than I fear. As I said in [comment #18](/show_bug.cgi?id=578697#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - Browser Wildcard Certificate Validation Issue") this is why I rated the risk as low (though I suspect this might be optimistic).

In today's weekly NSS team meeting, we decided not to disallow IP addresses
in cert subject common names at this time, but merely to disallow wildcards
in IP addresses in cert subject common names.
Rich, At this point, we're waiting for you to tell us when we can commit
this fix. We believe that will be effectively a public disclosure.

Marking "needed" for the branches rather than "blocking" since we can't really hold back a release fixing other issues waiting on coordination of disclosure for this. We'll take it when we can (probably through [bug 575620](/show_bug.cgi?id=575620 "RESOLVED FIXED - upgrade to NSPR 4.8.6 + NSS 3.12.7 and link against mozsqlite3"), which would be updated to reference nss 3.12.8 rather than 3.12.7)blocking1.9.1: ? → neededblocking1.9.2: ? → needed

I was simply trying to write failsafe code, assuring my code will transform any ip-address-with-wildcards input into a string that represents a correct ip address, allowing me to use nspr's ip address parsing code.
the other attached patches are smarter, because they avoid the need for such a transformation.

We used to do that sort of thing. But fixes got noticed anyway.
If you're going to do some sort of public disclosure, we'd like to know
when that will be, so we can have a release simultaneously, or just before.

I've just chased microsoft again (previously chased them on Friday). They've already confirmed they can reproduce the issue, but I still have no information from them about when they'll be fixing it. I've suggested that given the issue is relatively minor that we could release a fix for other browsers without them. I'll keep you posted.

Rich, there are two possible courses of action. A very strict one, and a relaxed one.
Given that we seem to agree this issue is low risk, I believe we're fine to avoid the very strict path, and take a more relaxed path.
I'm not the official speaker of the NSS team, nor for Mozilla security, but in my understanding from our meetings, both Mozilla and NSS are basically waiting for you, since it's your discovery, and we want to make sure you're the first to publish the information about this issue.
In our understanding, once we commit the patch to CVS, it's no longer a secret.
I propose we commit the fix to both NSS and KDE as soon as it's convenient, without the need to coordinate the CVS commit.
Then it's basically up to you to publish the issue.
Since we're not doing a firedrill for this fix, it'll probably take anything between 2-5 weeks until this fix ends up in a published stable Firefox security update.
(We'll probably have a NSS 3.12.8 release in about 1-2 weeks, then Firefox needs to pick it up for it's next release.)
Rich, thanks again for making us aware of this issue!
We'll have the weekly NSS meeting in about 30 minutes, where I can tell people about this proposal, and get a final confirmation that this proposal is OK with everyone.

So, I am not sure that [attachment 457469](/attachment.cgi?id=457469 "Alternative patch B, v0.1") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=457469&action=edit "Alternative patch B, v0.1") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=457469&action=diff "Alternative patch B, v0.1") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=578697&attachment=457469)
is really the one you want me to commit. Please confirm it, or refute it,
one more time. I will commit the patch you choose.

Nelson, at this time, we want to keep NSS' current behaviour, which is to still accept IP addresses in CN.
This is intended for backwards compatibility reasons, so that stable product branches can pick up the newer NSS release for security fixes (like this one), but not yet get a change in other behaviour.
Regarding disallowing IP addresses in CN altogether:
The decision was to start slowly. We'll begin by disallowing that at the PSM level, so that Firefox 4 will have the new behaviour ([bug 585616](/show_bug.cgi?id=585616 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - No longer allow IP addresses in SSL server's common names")), but older Firefox 3.6.x security updates will still accept non-wildcard IPs in CN.

Correct, that's the approach that has been agreed on in a NSS conference call.

Can we go ahead and prepare a new NSS release that includes this patch so we can go ahead and get Firefox nightlies using a fixed version?

Reed, we intend to release this fix with NSS 3.12.8, which I'd expect in the next 1-2 weeks, maybe sooner.

Want this in the next releases. Presumably we'll just take NSS 3.12.8, but if we run up against code-freeze we might just apply this patch. Time frame shouldn't be a problem though.blocking1.9.1: needed → .13+blocking1.9.2: needed → .10+

Package        : nss
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3170 CVE-2010-3173

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla's Network
Security Services (NSS) library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-3170
	NSS recognizes a wildcard IP address in the subject's Common
	Name field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow
	man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via
	a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
	Authority.

CVE-2010-3173
	NSS does not properly set the minimum key length for
	Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) mode, which makes it easier for
	remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms
	via a brute-force attack.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable
distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version
3.12.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your NSS packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

firefox security update (RHSA-2010-0782)

Original Release Date: November 16, 2010

Last Revised: June 21, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-321

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 7.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox. Network Security Services (NSS) is
a set of libraries designed to support the development of security-enabled
client and server applications.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2010-3175](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3175.html),
[CVE-2010-3176](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3176.html),
[CVE-2010-3179](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3179.html),
[CVE-2010-3183](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3183.html) and
[CVE-2010-3180](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3180.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in Firefox converted text
into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
a victim running Firefox, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the
context of the Gopher domain. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3177](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3177.html) to this issue.

A same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Firefox. An attacker could
create a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal
private data from a different website the victim has loaded with Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3178](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3178.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the script that launches Firefox. The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
Firefox, if that user ran Firefox from within an attacker-controlled
directory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3182.html) to this issue.

It was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode
implementation for key exchanges in Firefox accepted DHE keys that were 256
bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as such
keys are easily broken using modern hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3173](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3173.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way NSS matched SSL certificates when the
certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
address. NSS incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that fell
within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3170](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3170.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0782.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox, xulrunner, or nss installed:

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
When certain factors determine that the overall risk for a particular product to be set to Low,
Avaya will place these factors in the following table:

# USN-1007-1: NSS vulnerabilities

20 October 2010

An attacker could view sensitive information in an unlikely circumstance.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [nspr](/security/cves?package=nspr) - NetScape Portable Runtime Library
* [nss](/security/cves?package=nss) - Network Security Service libraries

## Details

Richard Moore discovered that NSS would sometimes incorrectly match an SSL

certificate which had a Common Name that used a wildcard followed by a partial

IP address. While it is very unlikely that a Certificate Authority would issue

such a certificate, if an attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information.

([CVE-2010-3170](/security/CVE-2010-3170))

Nelson Bolyard discovered a weakness in the Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral mode

(DHE) key exchange implementation which allowed servers to use a too small

key length. ([CVE-2010-3173](/security/CVE-2010-3173))

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.8-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.8-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that

use NSS, such as Firefox, Thunderbird or Evolution, to make all the

necessary changes. This update also includes updated NSPR packages to work

with the new NSS.

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox. Network Security Services (NSS) is
a set of libraries designed to support the development of security-enabled
client and server applications.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2010-3175, CVE-2010-3176, CVE-2010-3179, CVE-2010-3183,
CVE-2010-3180)

A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in Firefox converted text
into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
a victim running Firefox, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the
context of the Gopher domain. (CVE-2010-3177)

A same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Firefox. An attacker could
create a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal
private data from a different website the victim has loaded with Firefox.
(CVE-2010-3178)

A flaw was found in the script that launches Firefox. The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
Firefox, if that user ran Firefox from within an attacker-controlled
directory. (CVE-2010-3182)

This update also provides NSS version 3.12.8 which is required by the
updated Firefox version, fixing the following security issues:

It was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode
implementation for key exchanges in Firefox accepted DHE keys that were 256
bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as such
keys are easily broken using modern hardware. (CVE-2010-3173)

A flaw was found in the way NSS matched SSL certificates when the
certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
address. NSS incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that fell
within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
(CVE-2010-3170)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 3.6.11. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.6.11, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-70

## SSL wildcard certificate matching IP addresses

Announced
October 19, 2010
Reporter
Richard Moore
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.14
* Firefox 3.6.11
* SeaMonkey 2.0.9
* Thunderbird 3.0.9
* Thunderbird 3.1.5

### Description

Security researcher **Richard Moore** reported that
when an SSL certificate was created with a common name containing a
wildcard followed by a partial IP address a valid SSL connection could be
established with a server whose IP address matched the wildcard range
by browsing directly to the IP address. It is extremely unlikely that
such a certificate would be issued by a Certificate Authority.

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. (CVE-2010-3176, CVE-2010-3180)

A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in SeaMonkey converted text
into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
a victim running SeaMonkey, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in
the context of the Gopher domain. (CVE-2010-3177)

A flaw was found in the script that launches SeaMonkey. The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
SeaMonkey, if that user ran SeaMonkey from within an attacker-controlled
directory. (CVE-2010-3182)

It was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode
implementation for key exchanges in SeaMonkey accepted DHE keys that were
256 bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as
such keys are easily broken using modern hardware. (CVE-2010-3173)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey matched SSL certificates when the
certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
address. SeaMonkey incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that
fell within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
(CVE-2010-3170)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
the changes to take effect.

## Solution
