Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2010-3499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way antivirus (AV) products handle the execution of programs initiated through the `hcp://` protocol handler in Windows Help and Support Center. Specifically, AV products allow the execution of a program before detecting the malware, by leveraging an unusual behavior of Help and Support Center through the hcp:// protocol handler. This is not a Windows issue, but a flaw in how AV scanning engines process actions triggered via this protocol handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassing AV Scanning:** The primary weakness is that the AV products allow the execution of the malicious code before the AV scanner can analyze and block it.
*   **`hcp://` Protocol Handler Abuse:** The vulnerability is triggered using the `hcp://` protocol handler, which is part of Windows Help and Support Center and can be leveraged to launch executable code.
*   **Delayed Detection:** AV products detect the malicious file after it has been executed. They remove the evidence of the attack (the HTML file initiating the exploit), but the payload has already been executed.
*   **XSS Delivery Mechanism:** The exploit is delivered using an XSS mechanism, in conjunction with the `hcp://` handler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malware Execution:** The most immediate impact is the execution of arbitrary malicious code (e.g. Meterpreter, a payload) on the victim's machine.
*   **Bypassing AV Protection:** Successful exploitation effectively bypasses the AV's real-time protection, allowing attackers to install further malware.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By bypassing AV protection, an attacker can gain control of the system and perform malicious activities, including removing AV software, data exfiltration, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** The attack is typically initiated by tricking the victim into visiting a malicious web page. The malicious web page uses an iframe to call the `hcp://` protocol handler to trigger the exploit.
*  **Protocol Handler Abuse:** The core attack vector is abusing the `hcp://` protocol handler, which can be invoked via a crafted link or iframe in a web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Hosting:** An attacker needs a web server to host the initial malicious page, which contains the iframe calling the `hcp://` protocol handler.
*   **Exploit Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft the malicious HTML and exploit the `hcp://` handler vulnerability.
*   **Payload Generation:** The attacker also needs to generate a malicious payload (e.g., Meterpreter) to be executed on the victim's machine.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker relies on the victim visiting the malicious website (e.g. through social engineering or malicious link).

**Specific Vendor Information (from the document):**

*   **CVE-2010-3499:** Specifically assigned to F-Secure, which plans to address this in a future release.
*   **McAfee:**  Patched the issue and added signatures to detect the exploit after the code has been executed.
*  **Symantec/Norton:** Acknowledged the issue, recommending a firewall as a fix, but not fixing their AV product itself.
*   **AVG:**  Claimed to block the exploit at the network layer with their linkscanner, but it could be bypassed with obfuscation; did not address the AV engine vulnerability.
