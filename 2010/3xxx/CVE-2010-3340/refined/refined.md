Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-3340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the way Internet Explorer accesses objects in memory that have not been correctly initialized or have been deleted. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption, which can be exploited by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper object handling.
- Access of uninitialized or deleted objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted web page designed to exploit the vulnerability. The victim needs to visit this page using Internet Explorer. Compromised web sites or those hosting user-provided content/advertisements could also be leveraged for this attack.
- **Email:** While most email clients open HTML emails in restricted zones, a user could still be vulnerable if they click a link in a malicious email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or inject malicious content into a web page.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious webpage, usually through a link in an email, instant message or by using malicious ads.
- Knowledge and skills to create a specially crafted web page that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is rated "Critical" for most affected versions of Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated to some extent by running Internet Explorer with Enhanced Security Configuration (on Windows Servers) or by setting the security level to High or by disabling/prompting for Active Scripting in the Internet and local intranet zones.
- The provided documents also discuss workarounds that could be used until the patch is applied like disabling Active Scripting and use of a user defined stylesheet to block an attack vector of another vulnerability in the same patch
- Data Execution Prevention (DEP) can help mitigate code execution attacks.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited when the bulletin was released.
