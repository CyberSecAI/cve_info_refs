    "CVE-2010-3842": {
      "description": "cURL did not properly cut off directory parts from user provided file name to be downloaded on operating systems, where backslashes are used to separate directories and file names. This could allow remote servers to create or overwrite files via a Content-Disposition header that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of writing to a certain file in a user's home directory.",
      "root_cause": "cURL did not properly sanitize filenames provided by the server via the Content-Disposition header, specifically on operating systems using backslashes as directory separators.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Path traversal vulnerability"
       ],
      "impact": "A malicious server could use a crafted Content-Disposition header to specify a filename containing backslashes, causing cURL to write downloaded files to arbitrary locations on the client's filesystem, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can overwrite a configuration file, script, or executable.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious server sends a crafted Content-Disposition header with a filename containing backslashes."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to control the web server",
        "Ability to manipulate the Content-Disposition header of the web server"
      ],
        "affected_systems": "This flaw only affected those operating systems, where backslash is used to separate directories and file names, thus Microsoft Windows, Novell Netware, MSDOS, OS/2 and Symbian to mention some of them."
