## PMASA-2010-5

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2010-5

**Date:** 2010-08-20

### Summary

Several XSS vulnerabilities were found in the code.

### Description

It was possible to conduct a XSS attack using crafted URLs or POST parameters on several pages.

### Severity

We consider this vulnerability to be serious.

### Mitigation factor

If the auth\_type directive is set to 'config' and the directory is not protected,
these attacks are more likely to succeed; otherwise, an attacker would need to obtain a
valid token via another flaw on the server to be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

### Affected Versions

For 2.11.x: versions before 2.11.10.1 are affected.<br />
For 3.x: versions before 3.3.5.1 are affected.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 3.3.5.1 or 2.11.10.1 or newer or apply patch listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2097-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Thijs Kinkhorst
August 29, 2010                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3055 CVE-2010-3056

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-3055

  The configuration setup script does not properly sanitise its output
  file, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via
  a crafted POST request. In Debian, the setup tool is protected through
  Apache HTTP basic authentication by default.

CVE-2010-3056

  Various cross site scripting issues have been discovered that allow
  a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.8.1-5+lenny5.

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
have been fixed in version 3.3.5.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

==============================================================================
phpMyAdmin 3.3.5 / 2.11.10 <= Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
==============================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
The phpMyAdmin web application was vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting vulnerability.
2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web.
phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations with MySQL.
The most frequently used operations are supported by the user interface (managing databases, tables, fields, relations,
indexes, users, permissions, etc), while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.
3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
Some URLs in phpMyAdmin do not properly escape user inputs that lead to cross site scripting vulnerability.
For more information about this kind of vulnerability, see OWASP Top 10 - A2, WASC-8 and
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
phpMyAdmin 3.3.5 and lower
phpMyAdmin 2.11.10 and lower
