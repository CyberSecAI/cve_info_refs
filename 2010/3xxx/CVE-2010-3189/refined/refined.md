{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the UfPBCtrl.dll ActiveX control within Trend Micro Internet Security Pro 2010. The `extSetOwner` function accepts a parameter without proper validation, assuming it to be an initialized pointer. By providing an invalid memory address as a parameter, an attacker can force the process to jump to a controlled memory region.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate parameter validation",
      "Use of an attacker-controlled memory address to execute code"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user invoking the browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or distribute a malicious file that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.  User interaction is required as the target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  Trend Micro has released a hotfix to address the vulnerability."
