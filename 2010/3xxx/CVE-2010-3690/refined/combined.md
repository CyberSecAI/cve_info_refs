Several vulnerabilties have been discovered in phpCAS, a CAS client
library for PHP. The Moodle course management system includes a copy
of phpCAS.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in

It seems that this library is already present in the glpi package in Debian, as can be seen in <http://packages.debian.org/sid/all/glpi/filelist> (searching for phpcas).

That wouldn't help packaging it though.

By looking at the copyright of included files, I noticed that domxml-php4-php5.php is apparently under a DFSG non-free license (CC-BY-SA 2.0-FR) license (if I trust what's explained at <http://people.debian.org/~evan/ccsummary.html>).

I guess it shouldn't be uploaded to Debian as such, then.

domxml-php4-php5.php is currently used when using phpCAS in PHP 5, in particular with CAS 2 servers.

So it is actually required for the library to work.

There seems to be quite easy way to make phpCAS work without that library by using PHP dom API directly instead of the old PHP4 syntax + domxml-php4-php5.php. Such changes are similar to what's exposed at : <http://www.ja-sig.org/issues/secure/attachment/11173/php5-dom.patch>

More on this later.

Best regards,

Also, I've noticed that the licensing terms for phpCAS are a bit ambiguous...

Looking at : <http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CASC/phpCAS> ("License" chapter) it seems to me that they refer to the "New BSD License" while still mentioning an "advertising clause" in condition 3 in the text bellow :(

As such this would mean that it's using the "old style advertizing clause BSD" to me... which is DFSG-free I think, but not compatible with the GNU GPL.

I'm going to look for more details, and will ask clarification with upstream author.

Best regards,

Such a license seems DFSG free, as such advertising clauses are already present for programs like OpenSSL which is in main.

So I hope this is no problem for inclusion in Debian, as long as the domxml-php4-php5.php issue is resolved.

My 2 cents,

```

A new version of phpCAS has just been issued which contains an update of the license notice, which is now a "real" new BSD license.

The was apparently some confusion between various versions of the library at the time of redaction of the phpCAS wiki page.

At least <https://www.ja-sig.org/svn/cas-clients/phpcas/tags/1.0.1/docs/README> seems more kosher now.

Still the issue with the CC domxml-php4-php5.php inclusion is problematic for packaging it.

Subject: Updated 1.0.1 version of phpCAS package, now including DFSG-free
contents, needs testing
Date: Sun, 09 Nov 2008 17:09:30 +0100
```
Hi.

I've prepared an updated version of the phpCAS package (libcas-php) for
latest version 1.0.1 (which is now under a real new BSD license).

I have also applied a patch to replace the old version of
domxml-php4-php5.php (which was not DFSG-free) by the latest version of
domxml-php4-to-php5.php, which is now under LGPL.

As the contents should now be fully kosher for distribution by Debian, I
hope this will be a basis for upload of this package.

Still, I'm not fully sure that the change of version of
domxml-php4-php5.php (1.5.5) to domxml-php4-to-php5.php 1.20a is
completely safe and wouldn't cause regressions.

So any testing is very much welcome, of course.

The package source is in <http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pkg-cas/libcas-php/>
of course ;-)

Comments much welcome.

Hope this helps,

Dear mentors,

I am looking for a sponsor for my package "libcas-php".

* Package name    : libcas-php
  Version         : 1.0.1-1
  Upstream Author : Pascal Aubry
* URL             : <http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CASC/phpCAS>
* License         : BSD
  Section         : web

It builds these binary packages:
libcas-php - CAS client library for PHP

The package appears to be lintian clean.

The package can be found on mentors.debian.net:
- URL: <http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/l/libcas-php>
- Source repository: deb-src <http://mentors.debian.net/debian> unstable main contrib non-free
- dget <http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/l/libcas-php/libcas-php_1.0.1-1.dsc>

For those who care, phpCAS is a library which allows clients written in PHP to
authenticate to a CAS (Central Authentication Service) server.

The corresponding ITP is found at <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=495542>

Note that this package would allow the dependency of a number of
packages such as moodle and glpi on that package instead of shipping a
copy of phpCAS (<http://packages.debian.org/sid/all/moodle/filelist> and
<http://packages.debian.org/sid/all/glpi/filelist>).

I would be glad if someone uploaded this package for me.

Kind regards
 Olivier Berger

While you are at it, as your package also uses domxml-php4-php5.php why don't
you also package it? (it would be better if the code was finally ported instead
of using a wrapper, though).

debian/control:
> Depends: ${misc:Depends}, php5, php5-curl, php-db

Does it really need a web SAPI? or can it be used with php5-cli? in the latter
case add an ORed dependency on php5-cli in addition to php5.

debian/rules:
What about cleaning it up?

let's see what ftpmasters say about this.

Have you at lest tested the basic functionality of the library with the newer
version of domxml-php4-php5.php or are you blindly packaging stuff?

CAS.php:

Doesn't look good at all.

CAS/client.php:

Improper sanitation of getCallbackURL which uses data like REQUEST_URI; and
there's more about this, but I'm better going to test it and send the info to
bugtraq.

What about also shipping the api docs?

Hi.

Thanks for your review. I'll respond bellow.

I can see a couple of reasons why packaging domxml-php4-php5.php may not
be needed :
* it's a one file library, so I'm not sure it's really a habit of
packaging individual files ?
* it may be included in Debian packages only by those which include a
copy of phpCAS (but confirmation would be welcome)
* It will probably be no longer needed in phpCAS when future releases
will be rewritten (as you suggest) to only support php5, thus using the
php5 DOM API instead of the old PHP4 one. But that's not something that
would be done only for Debian, and I'll wait until a decision is taken
upstream (although I may also again contribute to upstream development
for that). More details here :
<http://www.ja-sig.org/issues/browse/PHPCAS-25> about a rewrite to get rid
of that wrapper.

So until usptream phpCAS releases a new version which allows to get rid
of domxml-php4-php5.php, I'll stick with it in.

Uh, SAPI ?

I have no clue.
Typical use of CAS is traditionally on web apps, and the protocol
involves redirections between the CAS server and clients, so I'm not so
sure a non web use is something interesting.

I suppose most of the use cases would be satisfied as is... unless in
CGI mode, where php5-cgi would be ORed too ?

No I have tested it, but you never exactly know for corner cases like
error messages hard to test.

Btw, my main motivation for packaging it is to use it on a production
server, so I'd better have it tested of course.

In any case I preferred some explicit mention that it's not exactly
upstream's version, to let people know who's to blame in case of
problem.

Will rephrase as :

        Differences from upstream version :
        -----------------------------------

        This package includes a Debian specific patch, to replace
        domxml-php4-php5.php version 1.5.5 (shipped with version 1.0.1
        of
        phpCAS) by version 1.20a of domxml-php4-to-php5.php, which is
        now
        under LGPL, making it DFSG-free.

        Best care was taken by the Debian packager to make sure there
        ain't
        regressions introduced by this upgrade of the DOM parsing
        library. Please report to the Debian BTS if you experience
        problems
        related to that change.

I have applied a patch in order to use /var/lib/libcas-php/pgtstorage/ and not /tmp for storage.

Hope I did it in a safe way.

In addition, I have tested more the proxy mode and fixed a nasty crash that occurred in validatePGT with the new domxml-php4-to-php5.

Changes to the previous package are :

libcas-php (1.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleanup debian/rules.
  * Add missing updtream README in docs/.
  * Move PGT storage dir to /var/lib/libcas-php/pgtstorage/ for safety
    reasons.
  * fix crash of validatePGT() when using new domxml-php4-to-php5.php
    (upstream bug PHPCAS-35)

Yeah, I forgot that all the matches I found of the dom lib were because of the
embedded copy of phpCAS

SAPI: Server Application Programming Interface

I saw that, but CAS.php looked like a more general pourpose script, although I
didn't examine it very well.

No, php5-cgi is already covered by php5.

IIRC it was pretty small, so there's no need, IMHO, to ship it in another

I don't see neither a manpage around nor a debian/links nor an ELF object.

You should better be more specific and say exactly what version of the licence

I'm not quite convinced that it is a good solution. But let's hold on for a
moment on that problem (read below).

$ lintian -I -E libcas-php_1.0.1-2.dsc
I: libcas-php source: debian-watch-file-is-missing

And what about the api docs?

From CAS/client.php:
> function setPGTStorageDB($user,

If it is not supported then it should be documented and the dependency on
php-db dropped or downgraded to suggests if you insist/think there are
chances for it to be used.

I have not fully reviewed/audited the code, but the code has several
vulnerabilities (symlink attacks, directory traversal, and XSS are those I
have identified).

The symlinks attack can be launched because of predictable file names used and
the default storage directory.
To make things worst, the user's input is not sanitized, so it is possible to
predict the file name where data is going to be written to by passing an
arbitrary pgtIou GET argument. The same lack of sanitization allows an
attacker to either perform XSS or directory traversal attacks by abusing the
callback function in CAS/client.php).

Additionally the functions calling getCallbackURL when proxy mode is enabled
can lead to XSS attacks if the validation request fails. A similar situation
also applies to functions calling getURL.

Tomorrow I'll send this information to bugtraq and will file the corresponding
bug reports against packages shipping phpCAS.

I strongly recommend you and upstream to audit the code.

It seems my interest it a bit stronger these days, so I've attempted to update the packaging based on current 1.3.1 upstream.

I've started to push some changes to allow rebuilding it inside the svn-buildpackage tree, using dpkg-buildpackage, provided one has extracted the upstram tarball.

I intend to get rid of svn-buildpackage and eventually use git-buildpackage.

In the meantime, the result is in <http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/obergix/phpcas.git>

Hope this helps

Hi.

I've prepared in :
<http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/obergix/phpcas.git;h=refs/heads/git-buildpackage%2Bdebpear>

an updated packaging for phpCAS (see also RFP #495542).

phpCAS can be managed as a PEAR package for some time, so I've started
over previous packaging attemps, using debpear.

I've tried and branch off upstream's git in order to be able to use
git-buildpackage.

I'd appreciate some review, and potential merge requests in order to try
and upload it soon in time for wheezy.

Hope you'll find this interesting.

Best regards,

P.S.: next, I'll try and use it to reintroduce fusionforge's authcas
plugin in the archive.

Why not using /git/pkg-php instead of your own private Git repo?

* Why did you add some debian/{docs,examples,install} files then? If
that's a PEAR package, then the package.xml will reference all of these,
"pear install" called by pkg-php-tools will do the work for you.

* I don't think you need the README.source

* If it's an initial release, please clean-up debian/changelog and have
only one entry there (eg, that last one from this month). You are
documenting what's in Debian, not your own work here.

* I don't believe that the apache-2.0 copyright notice you wrote in
debian/copyright is enough. Shouldn't you write the full text of it?

* Why did you override_dh_auto_install ?

* I don't think that the original long description from the package.xml
is good enough (it's not long enough, Lintian should even complain that
it should be more than 3 lines long). I believe this should be fixed
with something more descriptive (replacing ${phppear:description}).

Also, it'd be great if you could follow the branche naming convention
that I wrote here:
<http://pkg-php.alioth.debian.org/>

BTW, I have just uploaded a new version of debpear with all of your
suggestions (thanks for them). See "man debpear" on how to do what you
needed, I used php-cas as example in the man page! :)
If it didn't reach your favorite SID repo before you want to try, then
just build v0.2 from /git/pkg-php/debpear.git on Alioth.

Cheers,

Thomas

Cause it was easier for a start. And cause I wanted to go fast instead
of waiting for your advice on where to store it, but that can be changed
easily.

FYI, I also pushed my work to github so as to mark it as a clone of the
upstream repo, in the hope it can be useful wrt git-buildpackage
(security patches tracking and likes).

That's initially what I had started, using the direct result of debpear.

But I didn't like the way dh_auto_install worked with pkg-php-tools :
docs were installed as /usr/share/doc/php-cas/CAS/... instead of
directly under /usr/share/doc/php-cas/, for example for the included
examples/ subdir which should normally be
/usr/share/doc/php-cas/examples/ and not
/usr/share/doc/php-cas/CAS/examples per policy IIRC.

Maybe that's a problem with the package.xml which I could have solved
with a patch, or a problem with pkg-php-tools. But I must say I'm no
expert in debhelper, and I find it more explicit to state what needs to
be installed and where using the debian/[docs|examples|install]
files. The only problem is the path CAS-1.3.1 resulting there, which is
a bit annoying.

Maybe that's another improvement with pkg-php-tools to be able to manage
unversioned directories... but maybe too much demanding WRT the way pear
archives are arriving...

I've not read all past discussions on pkg-php-pear list so I may be
missing some obvious details.

Yeah, but I'll keep it for a while until my package source repo is a bit
more stable (saving me and comaintainers not using git-buildpackage
daily some more pain).

Done already (btw, did I report I've uploaded the package to the NEW
queue yesterday late ? ;).

I'm not sure, but that seems somehow what other packagers have done
already. Lintian didn't complain either.

Maybe the license text doesn't change (no variant for owner of copyright
/ institution names like in other licenses), so that's enough as is.

See above.

Well... I've thought about this but couldn't find a better myself, and
lintian didn't complain so...

I'll try and think about it. Thanks. I'll check that when newer versions
need more work. But first, I must work on fusionforge's authcas plugin ;)

Thanks.

That's a possibility, but it's not (yet) an "official" PEAR package I
think, even though technically it is... there's also the CAS packaging
team, but which hasn't been very active (it uses SVN, and i'm not sure
how much work it would be in alioth to add/switch to git).

Maybe others will volunteer too, so I'll let a bit of time pass, and
will probably decide on which place it fits best.

In the next uploads I could in any case add the pear team, and maybe the
cas team too as uloaders.

Let's see how it goes, and if more testing, or upstream activity
highlight much need for changes in the package.

Please don't store Debian stuff on Github. Feel free to make it a backup
of what's on Alioth (using a Git hook for example, there's a recent
thread about this in debian-devel@l.d.o, and it seems easy to do). IMO,
we are really better of using our own Debian server, rather than a 3rd
party which does commercial operation and who doesn't open its source
code (I mean by that that github itself is closed source).

I hope you wont see me as an open source extremist when writing this. I
just believe that Debian should stay independent from any 3rd party...

If you don't like the way pkg-php-tools does, then let's discuss that
instead! I don't really like it either, but at least we have a standard
for all of our PEAR packages, which is what pkg-php-tools is about.

Also, remember that pkg-php-tools is team maintained, and that Mathieu
Parent (its original author) doesn't have much time to maintain it
currently (he posted about it), so it'd be really welcome if you could
help enhancing it. I've already sent minor patches against it, but I'm
not so good with Perl, so help would be welcome!

> /usr/share/doc/php-cas/examples/ and not
> /usr/share/doc/php-cas/CAS/examples per policy IIRC.

I don't think the policy imposes you this. The later is fine, IMO. Could
you point to the policy manual part that does say this?

Well, again, I believe we should make all of our PEAR packages the same
way, and avoid multiple packaging standards. I don't see the trouble
with having /usr/share/doc/php-cas/CAS. In any ways, if you want to
remove that folder, then it could be done a way faster using:

override_dh_link:
	dh_link -O--buildsystem=phppear
	mv debian/php-cas/usr/share/doc/php-cas/CAS/* \
		debian/php-cas/usr/share/doc/php-cas
	rmdir debian/php-cas/usr/share/doc/php-cas/CAS

That's 4 lines of debian/rules that are avoiding 3 files under your
debian folder, plus it works even if upstream is changing stuff in his
package.xml.

Anyway again, I think this should be solved by modifying pkg-php-tools,
rather than modifying each individual PEAR package we maintain.

I have added Mathieu Parent as Cc:, so he will be able to tell why he
decided to use
/usr/share/doc/php-<pear-package-name>/<pear-package-name> for storing
docs. I am suspecting this is to avoid file collision.

> Done already (btw, did I report I've uploaded the package to the NEW

Nope! Well done! :)
I hope you'll make it for Wheezy.

By the way, I had no time to handle the nusoap stuff. Do you think you
could? Do you think we need to ask for a transition with the release
team? Or maybe it's too late already?

That's not what I've seen in other packages, but you may be right.
Anyway, if you're wrong, you'll take the responsibility of it, and
handle the ftp-masters flame! :)

I don't get it. There was an empty override_dh_auto_install. This was to
avoid that pkg-php-tools does it? Then how the hell did you get the .reg
in? :)

Hi all,

2012/6/14 Thomas Goirand <zigo@debian.org>:
[...]

I have not! ;-) This is php's fault :-P

See the code [code]:
"doc_dir=/usr/share/doc/".$this->_get_mainpackage(), (aka
doc_dir=/usr/share/doc/<packagename>).

[code]: <http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=pkg-php/pkg-php-tools.git;a=blob;f=lib/perl/Debian/Debhelper/Buildsystem/phppear.pm;h=3924dfaea4d21459154fc102aaef7bfb62cf053b;hb=HEAD>

I agree with you both, the docs should go in
/usr/share/doc/<packagename> and not in subdirs. This can be done in
pkg-php-tools by issuing a move after the install (between line 114
and line 115, you can add an if...move).

(Yes, I'm still busy, but have some time to write mails)

Cheers

Subject: CVE request - phpCAS: prevent symlink attacks, directory traversal
 and XSS during a proxy callback

Reported by Raphael Geissert almost 2 years ago but never really made it
into the upstream code:

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=495542#82>

In phpCAS proxy mode the parameters submitted during a callback to the
callback() function are not properly sanatized. The parameters are used
as file handles for filesystem access and parameters in urls.
This allows an attacker symlink attacks, directory traversal attacks and
XSS attacks. The issue has been fixed and patches are available:

<https://issues.jasig.org/browse/PHPCAS-80>
<https://developer.jasig.org/source/changelog/jasigsvn?cs=21538>

A new 1.1.3 release which contains the patch and various other bugfixes
will be released within the next few days.

Cheers,

Joachim
