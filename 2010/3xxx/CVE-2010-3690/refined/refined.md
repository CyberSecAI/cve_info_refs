```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper sanitization of parameters during a proxy callback in phpCAS. These parameters are used as file handles for filesystem access and parameters in URLs.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Symlink attacks
  - Directory traversal attacks
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files, execute code, or inject malicious scripts through the improper handling of parameters.
- Attack vectors: Exploitation occurs through crafted parameters submitted during a callback to the `callback()` function in proxy mode.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make requests that trigger a proxy callback, and provide malicious parameters in that callback.
