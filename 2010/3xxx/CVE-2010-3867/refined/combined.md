How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3519#c0)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-21 18:30:46 UTC  ``` This bug report was provided by an anonymous researcher working with SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.  Synthesis ---------  ProFTPd is a major Open Source FTP server:   <http://www.proftpd.org/> ProFTPd is for example used by ftp.apple.com, ftp.openssl.org and ftp.rsa.com.  When ProFTPd is compiled with mod_site_misc and when a directory is writable, an attacker can use mod_site_misc to:  - create a directory located outside the writable directory  - delete a directory located outside the writable directory  - create a symlink located outside the writable directory  - change the time of a file located outside the writable directory  Vulnerable configuration ------------------------  The following configuration is vulnerable:  - ProFTPd version range 1.3.0a (2006) to 1.3.3b (latest version)  - AND with the mod_site_misc module (not enabled by default in ProFTPd)  - AND with a writable directory (ProFTPd has no default writable    directory)  The mod_site_misc module provides the following FTP commands: (<http://www.proftpd.org/docs/contrib/mod_site_misc.html>)  - SITE MKDIR : create a directory  - SITE RMDIR : delete a directory  - SITE SYMLINK : create a symbolic link  - SITE UTIME : change the time of a file This module is provided with ProFTPd source code, but it is not enabled by default.  The ProFTPd configuration file (etc/proftpd.conf) can contain "Limit WRITE" sections to allow/deny users to write inside a directory. For example:   <Anonymous ~ftp>     ...     # Limit WRITE everywhere in the anonymous chroot.     <Limit WRITE>       DenyAll     </Limit>     # Allow WRITE in this directory only.     <Directory writableDir>       <Limit WRITE>         AllowAll       </Limit>     </Directory>   </Anonymous> The default ProFTPd configuration does not contain a writable directory.  Effects --------- So, this vulnerability can be used to:  - create a directory located outside the writable directory  - delete a directory located outside the writable directory  - create a symlink located outside the writable directory  - change the time of a file located outside the writable directory ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3519#c1)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-21 18:34:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3431](attachment.cgi?id=3431 "Fixes bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=3431&action=edit "Fixes bug") Fixes bug ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3519#c2)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-21 19:55:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3432](attachment.cgi?id=3432 "Updates previous patch, fixing directory walking code to deal with canonicalized paths") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=3432&action=edit "Updates previous patch, fixing directory walking code to deal with canonicalized paths") Updates previous patch, fixing directory walking code to deal with canonicalized paths  With the fixing of the issue by canonicalizing paths, the code which walked a MKDIR directory needed to be updated to assume the now-canonicalized path, rather than assuming a relative path. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3519#c3)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-21 20:07:52 UTC  ``` Patch committed to CVS, with accompanying regression tests.  Backported to 1.3.3 branch. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3519#c4)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-21 20:55:23 UTC  ``` I should add that there is a workaround configuration that can be used, to mitigate the buggy behavior until a patched mod_site_misc can be deployed:    <Limit SITE_MKDIR SITE_RMDIR SITE_SYMLINK SITE_UTIME>     DenyAll   </Limit>  will deny the use of any of the problematic commands. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3519#c5)  TJ Saunders    2010-10-29 18:54:50 UTC  ``` The vulnerability in question was present when mod_site_misc first appeared in the proftpd distribution, which was version 1.2.10rc1. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=3519#c6)  TJ Saunders    2010-11-17 13:55:15 UTC  ``` For future reference, the CVE for this vulnerability is:    <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3867> ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=3519#c7)  TJ Saunders    2010-12-18 12:50:31 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.3.4rc1. ``` |  |
