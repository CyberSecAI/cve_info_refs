- **Root cause:** An uninitialized memory access issue exists in QuickTime's handling of FlashPix images.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Uninitialized memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Viewing a maliciously crafted FlashPix image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by viewing a maliciously crafted FlashPix image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious FlashPix image and have the victim view it using a vulnerable version of QuickTime.
