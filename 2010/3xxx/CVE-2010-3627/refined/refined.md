**Summary:**

CVE-2010-3627 is one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Acrobat. It can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is within the PDF parsing or processing mechanism of Adobe Reader/Acrobat, specifically how it handles certain elements within a PDF document which can trigger an exploitable condition. The provided information doesn't specify the exact type of vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities:** The provided data doesn't pinpoint the exact nature of the vulnerability for CVE-2010-3627, but it's one of several reported in the documents. It's grouped together with multiple other CVEs, suggesting a possible underlying issue related to parsing or processing PDF content.
*   **Memory corruption:** Based on the impact descriptions like "execution of arbitrary code" and "Denial of Service," the vulnerability likely leads to some form of memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute malicious code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running Adobe Reader/Acrobat, leading to full system compromise.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted PDF document could crash the application, disrupting the user's ability to read PDF documents.
*   **Potential for writing files/escalating privileges:** Some advisories mention the possibility of writing arbitrary files or escalating local privileges, although not specifically in relation to CVE-2010-3627.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted PDF file:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious PDF file that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to open the malicious PDF file.
*   **Websites:** Malicious PDFs can be hosted on websites and opened automatically by the Adobe Reader browser plug-in.
*   **Email attachments:** Malicious PDFs can be sent as email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker doesn't need physical access to the victim's machine.
*   **Ability to craft a malicious PDF:** The attacker must create a PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to deliver the PDF:** The attacker must deliver the malicious PDF to the victim, either through a website, email or other means.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat versions 9.3.4 and earlier, 8.2.4 and earlier.
*   **Mitigations:** The advisories suggest upgrading to the latest versions of the software, disabling JavaScript, and taking care when opening PDF documents.
* **CVSS v2 Base Score:** The opensuse content reports a score of 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), which confirms the severity of the vulnerability.
