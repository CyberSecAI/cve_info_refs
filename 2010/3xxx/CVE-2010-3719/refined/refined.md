Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-3719

**Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `ScheduleTask` method of the `IMAdminSchedTask.asp` page in Symantec IM Manager's administrative interface.
- User input from a POST variable is not properly sanitized before being passed to an `eval` call.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Code Injection:** Failure to sanitize user input leads to the ability to inject arbitrary code.
- **Eval Function Usage:** Use of `eval` on unsanitized user-controlled data is a major security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary ASP code on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the affected server and potentially the network it resides on.
- **Context of Execution:** The injected code executes within the security context of the user who visits the malicious link.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Malicious Link:** Attackers need to craft a malicious link and coerce an authenticated user to visit it, typically through social engineering.
- **POST Variable Manipulation:** The injected code is sent via a POST variable that is then processed by the vulnerable script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Authenticated User Coercion:** The attacker must be able to induce a logged in user to visit a crafted malicious link. This typically requires some form of social engineering.

**Additional Information:**
- Symantec released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a digital vaccine filter (ID 10776).
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2010-10-12 and publicly released on 2011-01-31.
