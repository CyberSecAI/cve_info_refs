{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure handling of file uploads in the FreePBX recordings interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path traversal vulnerability through the manipulation of the `$usersnum` variable, allowing an attacker to save files outside of the intended directory.",
    "Unrestricted file extension, allowing the upload of malicious PHP files.",
     "Lack of proper input validation, not sanitizing the filename, allowing directory traversal using ../"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote arbitrary code execution on the web server with the permissions of the web server user.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to the `/admin/config.php` endpoint with a multipart form data payload containing the malicious file and a crafted `usersnum` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the FreePBX web interface. No specific privileges within the FreePBX application are mentioned, but based on the attack vector, they need to be able to upload files through the recordings menu. "
