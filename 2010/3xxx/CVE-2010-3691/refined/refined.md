Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-3691:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of parameters submitted during a callback in phpCAS proxy mode. These parameters are used as file handles for filesystem access and within URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Symlink attacks:** The lack of sanitization allows attackers to create symlinks that can be exploited to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Directory traversal:** Attackers can use manipulated parameters to access files and directories outside the intended scope.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially:
- Gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.
- Execute arbitrary code by manipulating file paths or URLs.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when phpCAS is used in proxy mode.
- The attacker needs to manipulate parameters during the callback phase, specifically `pgtUrl` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a proxy callback.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the parameters within the callback URL, especially pgtUrl.
- No other specific capabilities are explicitly mentioned, but the attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server running phpCAS.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Raphael Geissert.
*   Patches to address the issue were released in phpCAS version 1.1.3.
*   The issue is also tracked as PHPCAS-80 in the Jasig issue tracker.
*   The vulnerability exists because the `getCallbackURL` function in `CAS/client.php` uses unsanitized data from `REQUEST_URI`
*   The vulnerability can also lead to XSS by injecting malicious code into the callback URLs.
