This document discusses multiple vulnerabilities affecting various Oracle products and components. It references the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010, which addresses 85 vulnerabilities, including 31 in Sun products.

**Root cause of vulnerabilities:** Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities exist within various Oracle products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Remote execution of arbitrary code
* Information disclosure
* Denial of service

**Impact of exploitation:**
* Execution of arbitrary code or commands
* Information disclosure
* Denial of service
* Access to sensitive information from compromised databases.

**Attack vectors:**
* Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers.
* Specific to Siebel, a system with the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control installed can be attacked remotely by an unauthenticated attacker by enticing the user to access a specially crafted HTML file (most likely a website controlled by the attacker).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* For some vulnerabilities, remote unauthenticated access is possible.
* For the Siebel vulnerability, the attacker needs to lure a user to a malicious HTML file.
* Access to the network where the vulnerable Oracle products are available.
