  "cveId": "CVE-2010-3846",
  "description": "An array index error, leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way CVS version control system applied certain delta fragments changes from input file in the RCS (Revision Control System file) format. A local attacker, with access to the system controlling the repository, could store a specially-crafted RCS file into the CVS repository and trick the remote user to checkout (update their CVS repository tree) with this file, which could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the CVS server process on the system hosting the CVS repository.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "An array index error in the `apply_rcs_changes` function when processing delta fragments from an RCS file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the CVS server process on the system hosting the CVS repository.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A local attacker stores a specially crafted RCS file into a CVS repository."
    ],
   "requiredCapabilities": [
      "The attacker requires access to the system controlling the repository to store the malicious RCS file.",
      "The attacker needs to trick a remote user to checkout (update their CVS repository tree) containing the malicious RCS file which causes the vulnerable code to be executed on the server."
    ]
  },
    "affectedComponents": [
        "CVS version control system",
        "Specifically, the `apply_rcs_changes` function in `rcs.c`"
    ],
  "additionalNotes": [
     "The vulnerability is triggered on the CVS server when a remote user attempts to checkout/update a repository containing the malicious RCS file.",
     "The issue does not affect the versions of the cvs package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5, but it does affect the versions shipped with Fedora 12 and 13.",
     "An attacker with read access could trigger the bug on a repository holding an already corrupted file. However the initial repository corruption seems not to be possible remotely."
