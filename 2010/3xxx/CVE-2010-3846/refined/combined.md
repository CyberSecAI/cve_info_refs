How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=642146#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-12 07:47:05 UTC  ``` An array index error, leading to heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way CVS version control system applied certain delta fragments changes from input file in the RCS (Revision Control System file) format. A local attacker, with access to the system controlling the repository, could store a specially-crafted RCS file into the CVS repository and trick the remote user to checkout (update their CVS repository tree) with this file, which could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the CVS server process on the system hosting the CVS repository.

So one of these must be wrong, and I'd like to know which one.  Specifically, RHSA-2010:0918-1 says "... arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the CVS server process on the system hosting the CVS repository" - but the attacker was already assumed to have direct write access to the repository, so this would be a relatively minor issue.  Jan's comment says "... arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running cvs client executable".  So this is an attack on the CVS client by a malicious or compromised CVS server.  This is more of a security issue.  Additionally, the RHSA-2010:0918-1 description is internally-inconsistent: it mentions a remote "victim", but then says that the attack is on the CVS server anyway (in which case the remote user is not a victim).  Thus, I find it more likely that Jan's description is the correct one.  I did not try to match this against the code.  I see that src/rcs.c is being patched, but I did not check whether this file is part of the server or/and the client.   ```  [Comment 47](show_bug.cgi?id=642146#c47)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-02 12:10:50 UTC  ``` Hi Solar,    thank you for your comments.  (In reply to [comment #45](show_bug.cgi?id=642146#c45)) > The description of this vulnerability in RHSA-2010:0918-1 is inconsistent with > one in Jan's comment on this bug.

Yes, my original description (c#0) stating that this would lead to 'arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running cvs client executable' was wrong. See below for further details.  >  > Specifically, RHSA-2010:0918-1 says "... arbitrary code execution with the > privileges of the CVS server process on the system hosting the CVS repository" > - but the attacker was already assumed to have direct write access to the > repository, so this would be a relatively minor issue.    Yes, the above description is the correct one. Also, the assumption the local attacker would need to have access to the system, controlling the repository, is the proper one. The scenario of the CVS checkout process is as follows: 1, client initiates CVS checkout, 2, server receives the request, retrieves the original form of the    file to be checkout-ed, together with changes applied in the meantime    to it, 3, server creates the final form of the checkouted file and then sends    it to the client.  So all the code is executed on the side of the server. If something goes wrong (like in this case, the server 'checkout' process aborts), the client is informed about this fact via standard error file descriptor and client displays the message.  >  > Jan's comment says "... arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the > user running cvs client executable".  So this is an attack on the CVS client by > a malicious or compromised CVS server.  This is more of a security issue.  See above, the checkout preparation / performing steps are not executed on the client. Client only receives the result or error message if some failure occurred.  >  > Additionally, the RHSA-2010:0918-1 description is internally-inconsistent: it > mentions a remote "victim", but then says that the attack is on the CVS server > anyway (in which case the remote user is not a victim).  Thus, I find it more > likely that Jan's description is the correct one.  Yes again, the 'remote victim' part in the advisory text is not correct. To say 'remote user' is more appropriate. In fact, the checkout of the remote user is needed only / is a way only, how to achieve CVS server crash.  >  > I did not try to match this against the code.

Note: The original c#0 was corrected / updated to reflect the current       knowledge.  Solar, let us know, if there is still some confusing / unclear description left yet, and we will clarify.

An attacker with read access could trigger the bug on a repository holding an already corrupted file.  I discovered the problem by doing read-only access on a repo that for some unknown reason was already corrupted (it was a reasonably old repo, so possibly a long-fixed bug).   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=642146#c49)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-12-03 10:21:55 UTC  ``` Hi Ralph,  (In reply to [comment #48](show_bug.cgi?id=642146#c48)) > Re: >  > > the attacker was already assumed to have direct write access to the repository >  > This might not be quite accurate. >  > An attacker with read access could trigger the bug on a repository holding an > already corrupted file.    Yes, but this to succeed requires the repository to be already corrupted locally. Then it is only question of time till someone checkouts that particular file. Repository corruption seems not to be possible remotely. So in that scenario, the real attacker is the person, who corrupts the repository. The remote user action is just a way, how to perform the attack.  >  > I discovered the problem by doing read-only access on a repo that for some > unknown reason was already corrupted (it was a reasonably old repo, so possibly > a long-fixed bug).   ``` |  |
