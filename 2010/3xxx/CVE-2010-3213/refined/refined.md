Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in Outlook Web Access (OWA) for Exchange 2007. The root cause is the lack of sufficient validation of HTTP requests sent to OWA by authenticated users. Specifically, OWA fails to implement CSRF protection mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of REFERER check:** OWA does not verify the `Referer` header of incoming requests.
*   **Absence of CSRF nonce/token:** OWA does not use CSRF tokens or nonces to protect against forged requests.
*   **XML Cross Site POST:** The CSRF attack can be performed through XML cross-site POST requests, where POST data is sent through the `name` parameter with a blank `value`, and the server-side XML parser tolerates the trailing `=` character.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:

*   **Set email filters (e.g., forward rules):** This would allow the attacker to redirect the victim's incoming emails to a different address.
*   **Set remote wipe of mobile devices:** If the user accesses their email through a mobile device, the attacker could trigger a remote wipe of the device.
*   **Completely pwn the victim's mail account:** This implies full control over the victim's email account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker crafts a malicious web page containing a form that makes a request to the vulnerable OWA instance.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker tricks a user with a valid OWA session into visiting the malicious page.
*   **Exploitation via Browser:** The user's browser, while authenticated to OWA, will execute the crafted request in the background by visiting the malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a web page:** The attacker must be able to host the malicious web page.
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker must be able to entice the victim into visiting the malicious page.
*   **Target must be authenticated to OWA:** The attack will only work if the user is already logged into OWA when they visit the malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft in September 2009.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in the beta release of Exchange 2010 and in Exchange 2007 Service Pack 3.
* The exploit uses a specifically crafted POST request with XML data in the parameter name.
