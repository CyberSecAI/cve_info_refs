{
  "CVE-2010-3904": {
    "Description": "A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel, specifically in the `rds_page_copy_user` function. This flaw allows a local attacker to gain root privileges by exploiting a lack of input validation when handling user-supplied addresses within the RDS sockets.",
    "Root cause": "The `rds_page_copy_user` function in the RDS protocol implementation does not properly check if a user-supplied address exists in the user segment of memory. This lack of validation allows a local attacker to provide a kernel address as an iovec base address to a socket call, leading to arbitrary kernel memory overwrite.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Unchecked memory access",
      "Local Privilege Escalation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can gain root privileges by exploiting this vulnerability. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breach, and denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Maliciously crafted socket calls"
    ],
     "Required capabilities": [
      "Local access to the vulnerable system",
      "Ability to perform socket calls"
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
        "The vulnerability exists in Linux kernel versions 2.6.30 to 2.6.36-rc8, and 2.6.38-rc8.",
        "The vulnerability was introduced via commit `7875e18e` (v2.6.30-rc1).",
        "The vulnerability was fixed by commit `799c10559d60f159ab2232203f222f18fa3c4a5f` in the upstream kernel.",
        "The net/rds socket protocol module only lives in the -extra kernel package, which is not installed by default on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11."
