The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack, but none of them are related to CVE-2010-3758.

The following vulnerabilities are described:

1.  **IBM TSM FastBack Server \_SendToLog Remote Code Execution Vulnerability** (ZDI-10-180, ZDI-CAN-658)
    *   **Root cause:** Unsafe copy to a stack buffer when building a formatted event log message for the `AGI_SendToLog` method.
    *   **Weakness:** Stack buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution under the context of the fastback server.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network, TCP port 11406.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** No authentication required.

2.  **IBM TSM FastBack Server ActivateLTScriptReply Remote Code Execution Vulnerability** (ZDI-10-181, ZDI-CAN-660)
    *   **Root cause:**  `memcpy` within the `_AGI_S_ActivateLTScriptReply` function uses a user-supplied length to copy data into a fixed-size stack buffer.
    *   **Weakness:** Stack buffer overflow.
    *  **Impact**: Remote code execution under the context of the fastback server.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network, TCP port 11406.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** No authentication required.

3.  **IBM TSM FastBack Server USER\_S\_AddADGroup Remote Code Execution Vulnerability** (ZDI-10-184, ZDI-CAN-663)
    *   **Root cause:**  `strcat` of user-supplied data to a fixed-size stack buffer within the `USER_S_AddADGroup` function.
    *   **Weakness:** Stack buffer overflow.
     *  **Impact**: Remote code execution under the context of the fastback server.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network, TCP port 11460.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** No authentication required.

4.   **IBM TSM FastBack Server FXCLI\_checkIndexDBLocation Remote Code Execution Vulnerability** (ZDI-10-183, ZDI-CAN-662)
    *   **Root cause:** `strcpy` of user-supplied data into a fixed size buffer on the stack within the `FXCLI_checkIndexDBLocation` function.
    *   **Weakness:** Stack buffer overflow
    *    **Impact**: Remote code execution under the context of the fastback server.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network, TCP port 11460.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** No authentication required.

The IBM support document (swg21443820) confirms that fixes are available for security vulnerabilities in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack, but does not provide specific details on the vulnerabilities.
Although these advisories describe multiple vulnerabilities in the same product, and have similar characteristics (stack buffer overflows in the FastBack Server that lead to RCE) none of them relate to the requested CVE.
