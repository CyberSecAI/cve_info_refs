## IBM TSM FastBack Server \_SendToLog Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-180ZDI-CAN-658

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/storage-mgr-fastback/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9706']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by default on tcp port 11406. The issue is due to an unsafe copy to a buffer located on the stack. This buffer is used to build a formatted event log message for the AGI\_SendToLog method. Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution under the context of the fastback server. |

## IBM TSM FastBack Server ActivateLTScriptReply Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-181ZDI-CAN-660

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/storage-mgr-fastback/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9866']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by default on tcp port 11406. The issue is due to a memcpy within the \_AGI\_S\_ActivateLTScriptReply function. The process trusts a user-supplied length and copies user-supplied data to a fixed length buffer located on the stack. Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution under the context of the fastback server. |

## IBM TSM FastBack Server USER\_S\_AddADGroup Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-184ZDI-CAN-663

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |

| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/storage-mgr-fastback/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9490']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by default on TCP port 11460. The issue is due to a strcat of user supplied data to a fixed length buffer located on the stack. By providing sufficiently large values for a group, workgroup, or domain name this buffer can be overflowed. Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution under the context of the fastback server. |

## IBM TSM FastBack Server FXCLI\_checkIndexDBLocation Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-183ZDI-CAN-662

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |

| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9489']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by default on TCP port 11460. The issue is due to a strcpy of user supplied data and length to a fixed size buffer located on the stack. Specifically, this issue can be triggered by providing a large enough user\_path variable. Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution under the context of the fastback server. |
