  "CVE-2010-3081": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Ingestion Date": "2025-01-26",
      "Score": "High"
    },
    "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "Extracted Details": {
      "Root cause": "The compat_alloc_user_space() function in the Linux kernel 32/64-bit compatibility layer implementation was missing sanity checks, allowing controlled length argument from user-space.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Missing sanity checks in compat_alloc_user_space() leading to a stack pointer underflow.",
         "Insufficient checks on the length argument in compat_alloc_user_space().",
        "Missing check on the validity of the memory pointer in user-space to which the process is trying to write."
        
      ],
      "Impact": "Local, unprivileged user privilege escalation, potential memory corruption.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Local exploitation via crafted length argument to compat_alloc_user_space().",
         "Abuse of the  compat_mc_getsockopt function for MCAST_MSFILTER.",
         "Abuse via other areas of the Linux kernel where length arguments can be controlled from userspace."
      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "Local, unprivileged user. For remote attacks additional vulnerabilities may be needed.",
       "Affected components": [
        "Linux kernel 32/64-bit compatibility layer implementation"
       ]
    },
    "Additional Information": {
      "Exploit": "A public exploit is available.",
      "Workaround": "Disable 32-bit ELF support via `echo ':32bits:M:0:\\x7fELF\\x01::/bin/echo:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register` (note: may not always work)",
       "Patch": "Backported patches included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux updates and other distributions."
