| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=632657#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-10 16:42:22 UTC  ``` It was discovered that SSL connections to the MRG broker could easily be blocked.  If a client or application initiated a connection to the MRG broker's listening SSL port, the client connection would block access to the port until the SSL handshake completes (or fails).  If a client failed to proceed with it, then the thread was never freed to process other connections, denying service to other clients.  Only SSL connections were affected by this issue, and SSL support is not enabled by default.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=632657#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-14 17:24:38 UTC  ``` The fix for this issue was public a year and a half ago, but I do not know if the security implications were every really known:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/qpid/trunk/qpid/cpp/src/qpid/sys/ssl/SslSocket.cpp?r1=790291&r2=790290&pathrev=790291&view=patch>  However, the second half of the above patch was reverted later:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/qpid/trunk/qpid/cpp/src/qpid/sys/ssl/SslSocket.cpp?r1=919487&r2=938992>  with the following commit message:  QPID-2083: Some improvements to error handling for NSS based SSL implementation.  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-2083>  Looking at the RHEL6 and Fedora sources, the initial patch has been applied, and in RHEL6 at least the second hunk has been reverted, as with upstream (but not in Fedora).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=632657#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-08 01:49:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0756 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0756.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=632657#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-08 01:56:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Messaging for MRG on RHEL-4   Messaging Base for MRG on RHEL-4  Via RHSA-2010:0757 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0757.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=632657#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-10 16:42:22 UTC  ``` It was discovered that SSL connections to the MRG broker could easily be blocked.  If a client or application initiated a connection to the MRG broker's listening SSL port, the client connection would block access to the port until the SSL handshake completes (or fails).  If a client failed to proceed with it, then the thread was never freed to process other connections, denying service to other clients.  Only SSL connections were affected by this issue, and SSL support is not enabled by default.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=632657#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-14 17:24:38 UTC  ``` The fix for this issue was public a year and a half ago, but I do not know if the security implications were every really known:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/qpid/trunk/qpid/cpp/src/qpid/sys/ssl/SslSocket.cpp?r1=790291&r2=790290&pathrev=790291&view=patch>  However, the second half of the above patch was reverted later:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/qpid/trunk/qpid/cpp/src/qpid/sys/ssl/SslSocket.cpp?r1=919487&r2=938992>  with the following commit message:  QPID-2083: Some improvements to error handling for NSS based SSL implementation.  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-2083>  Looking at the RHEL6 and Fedora sources, the initial patch has been applied, and in RHEL6 at least the second hunk has been reverted, as with upstream (but not in Fedora).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=632657#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-08 01:49:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0756 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0756.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=632657#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-08 01:56:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Messaging for MRG on RHEL-4   Messaging Base for MRG on RHEL-4  Via RHSA-2010:0757 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0757.html>   ``` |  |

Subject: qpidd SSL connection DoS (CVE-2010-3083)

Just a heads up for anyone that ships qpid.  About a year and a half
ago a blocking condition was found with SSL connections to qpidd, but I
don't think upstream really thought about the security implications.

It was fixed upstream in July 2009.

The details are in our bug:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3083>
