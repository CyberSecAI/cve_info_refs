  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2010-3349",
    "description": "Ardour 2.8.11 places a zero-length directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse shared library in the current working directory.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an insecure change to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. When there's an empty item on the colon-separated list of LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so treats it as '.' (current working directory).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure modification of LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, specifically appending an empty string which is interpreted as the current working directory by ld.so."
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can gain privileges by placing a malicious shared library in the current working directory. When the vulnerable application is executed, it will load the attacker's library instead of the intended one, leading to arbitrary code execution with the application's privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker needs to write a malicious library in a directory where the vulnerable script will be executed from."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local users with write access to a directory where a vulnerable application is executed.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable code is in the script that launches ardour: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/ardour2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. If the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not already set, the result will be `/usr/lib/ardour2:` which is interpreted as `/usr/lib/ardour2:.` causing the current directory to be searched for shared libraries."
