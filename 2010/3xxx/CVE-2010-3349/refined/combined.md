| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-28 21:06:07 UTC  ``` Raphael Geissert conducted a review of various packages in Debian and found that ardour contained a script that could be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary code [1].  The vulnerability is due to an insecure change to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and environment variable used by ld.so(8) to look for libraries in directories other than the standard paths.  When there is an empty item in the colon-separated list of directories in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so(8) treats it as a '.' (current working directory).  If the given script is executed from a directory where a local attacker could write files, there is a chance for exploitation.  In Fedora, /usr/bin/ardour2 is replaced with a custom script that then calls /usr/libexec/ardour2.  This script re-sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH insecurely:  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/ardour2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  A solution is to patch the script to test if $LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set first before attempting to modify it:  if [ -z ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} ]; then     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/foo else     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/foo:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} fi  This issue has been assigned the name [CVE-2010-3349](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3349).  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=598283>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-28 21:07:55 UTC  ``` Created ardour tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 638367](show_bug.cgi?id=638367 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3349 ardour: insecure library loading vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c2)  Orcan Ogetbil    2010-09-28 21:38:41 UTC  ``` thanks for the report. Let me understand the issue better. When $LD_LIBRARY_PATH is empty, the line    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/ardour2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH becomes just    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/ardour2:  This means that the current working directory is added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. An attacker places a malicious library where the user is likely to execute /usr/bin/ardour2 and then boom!  Is this correct?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-28 21:53:52 UTC  ``` Yes, that is exactly correct.  With that colon at the end there, ld.so essentially treats it as "/usr/lib/ardour2:.".   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c4)  Orcan Ogetbil    2010-09-29 05:41:58 UTC  ``` I contacted upstream about this. On the other hand, having a second thought, this sounds rather like a bug in ld to me.  Any ideas why an empty item is treated as a dot '.' as opposed to null?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-29 07:42:42 UTC  ``` This one-liner should work as an alternative to if-else-fi fix: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/foo${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c6)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-29 17:00:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c4)) > I contacted upstream about this.

I don't know if it's necessarily a bug or expected behaviour, however there is some discussion about whether or not to change it:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/09/29/1>  In the meantime, correcting this would be ideal as I think we would want to follow upstream on this, and they would need to weigh in on the discussion.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=638365#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 10:57:16 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

```
Package: ardour
Version: 1:2.8.11-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
User: team@security.debian.org
Usertags: ldpath

Hello,

During a review of the Debian archive, I've found your package to
contain a script that can be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code.

The vulnerability is introduced by an insecure change to
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and environment variable used by ld.so(8) to look for
libraries on a directory other than the standard paths.

Vulnerable code follows:

/usr/bin/ardour2 line 5:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/ardour2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

When there's an empty item on the colon-separated list of
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so treats it as '.' (i.e. CWD/$PWD.)
If the given script is executed from a directory where a potential,
local, attacker can write files to, there's a chance to exploit this
bug.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE id [CVE-2010-3349](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3349). Please make sure
you mention it when forwarding this report to upstream and when fixing
this bug (everywhere: upstream and here at Debian.)

Can you elaborate on this or give a link with a more detailed
explanation?

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a well-known feature, and every binary can, by
design, be run with libraries from different paths, including CWD, if
the user sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately.

I don't see how importing LD_LIBRARY_PATH in a script is any different
from running an arbitrary binary (also with LD_LIBRARY_PATH being set).
According to your logic, every dynamically linked binary would be
vulnerable.

In other words, I don't see a security issue at all. If the user
deliberately sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH, it's his ultimate responsibility.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is just a more cumbersome way of running completely
different code.

I might miss something, but unless you rely on RPATH, you could file
this kind of bug against almost every package. And given that
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a valid use case, we somehow need to pass it to the
binary. I don't see that manually filtering LD_LIBRARY_PATH is any good.
The user sets it, the user gets it.

Please feel free to correct my understanding of the "issue" at hand.

Cheerio

Ok, it's the trailing colon that might cause problems if LD_LIBRARY_PATH
is unset and CWD contains a malicious library.

I'm going to fix this.

Sorry for bothering you in the first place.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
