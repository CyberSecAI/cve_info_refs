Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3350:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure way `bareftp` handles the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. Specifically, the script `/usr/bin/bareftp` in `bareftp` version 0.3.4-1 prepends `/usr/lib/bareftp:` to the existing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable without proper checks. If `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is empty, this results in a colon-separated list with an empty element at the beginning. The dynamic linker (`ld.so`) interprets an empty element in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as the current working directory (CWD) which can allow an attacker to inject malicious shared libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure use of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:** The script directly modifies `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` without sanitizing or validating existing content.
- **Reliance on CWD:** By introducing an empty path in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, the application becomes vulnerable to loading shared libraries from the current working directory.
- **Lack of input validation:** The script does not validate if the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is empty before concatenating.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain elevated privileges by placing a malicious shared library in a directory where a user executes the vulnerable `bareftp` script, as the malicious library would be loaded and executed when the script is launched.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code through the injected malicious shared library.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack requires a local attacker to have write access to a directory where a user will execute the vulnerable `bareftp` script.
- **Trojan Horse Shared Library:** The attacker must create a malicious shared library and place it in the same directory as where the user runs `bareftp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a local user account.
- **Write Access:** The attacker needs to have write access to a directory where a user might run the vulnerable `bareftp` script.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` vulnerability in `bareftp`.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this vulnerability involves checking if the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable is empty before appending the path. If it is empty, it should be set without appending which avoids the empty path in the colon separated list.
- The vulnerability was present in version `0.3.4-1` of the Debian package `bareftp` and was fixed in version `0.3.4-1.1`.
- The fix was implemented as a Non-Maintainer Upload (NMU) by Gustavo Panizzo.
