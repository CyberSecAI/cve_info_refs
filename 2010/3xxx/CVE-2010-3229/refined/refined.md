Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-3229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Secure Channel (SChannel) security package processes protocol requests during the SSL/TLS handshake. Specifically, SChannel fails to check a logical condition before processing these requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is a lack of proper input validation within the SChannel component when handling incoming SSL/TLS connections. The failure to check a logical condition during the handshake leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition. The targeted system's LSASS service stops responding, causing the system to restart. This interruption continues until the system restarts.
*   **Repeated Exploitation:** An attacker can repeatedly exploit the vulnerability, causing the system to restart again and again, thus creating a sustained DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** A remote, anonymous attacker can send a specially crafted network packet via SSL to an affected system.
*   **SSL/TLS Handshake:** The vulnerability is triggered during the SSL/TLS handshake process. The specially crafted packet is introduced during this handshake.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Anonymous Access:** The attacker does not need to have authenticated access to the targeted system. They can initiate the attack remotely.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected system.
*   **SSL-Enabled Service/Application:** The targeted system must be running a service or application that uses SChannel to process incoming SSL connections, e.g., IIS, RDP, SSTP, SMTP-over-SSL, or LDAP-over-SSL.
*   **Crafted Packets:** The attacker must be able to create and send specially crafted network packets that trigger the vulnerability during the SSL/TLS handshake.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Mitigation:**  Systems not configured to receive incoming SSL connections are not vulnerable. By default, Windows systems are not configured to receive SSL network traffic.
*   **Workaround:** No workarounds were identified by Microsoft.
*   **Affected Systems:** Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 are affected.
*   **Exploitability:** At the time of release, Microsoft had not seen reports of active exploitation. However, they categorized this vulnerability as "Important".
