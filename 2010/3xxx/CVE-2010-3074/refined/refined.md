{
  "CVE-2010-3074": {
    "Description": "encfs was prone to a watermarking attack",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way EncFS handles Initialization Vectors (IVs) in CBC mode encryption. The XOR of IVs for different blocks was not uniformly distributed, making it possible to identify specific patterns.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Weaknesses in the IV setup for CBC mode encryption."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can identify with high probability if a user has stored a specifically prepared file within the encrypted file system. This could reveal sensitive information such as the presence of certain files.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack involves preparing a specific file and then checking the encrypted data for predictable patterns caused by the vulnerability in the IV handling.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to calculate XOR of the initialization vectors (IV) for some blocks. The attacker also needs to be able to examine the encrypted data. It's not explicitly stated, but likely an attacker with read access to the encrypted data, would be able to identify the file."
