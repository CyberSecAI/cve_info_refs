  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2010-3764",
    "description": "The Old Charts system generated graphs with predictable names into the \"graphs/\" directory, which also could be browsed to see its contents. This allowed unauthorized users to see product names and charted information about those products over time.",
    "root_cause": "The Bugzilla 'Old Charts' system generated graphs with predictable filenames and stored them in a publicly accessible directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information",
      "Information Exposure",
       "Predictable Resource Location"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized users could view product names and charted information, potentially exposing confidential data from different Bugzilla projects hosted on the same codebase.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct access to the 'graphs/' directory via web browser",
        "Guessing or brute-forcing predictable file names within the 'graphs/' directory"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have network access to the Bugzilla instance. No special privileges are needed to view the graphs.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because charts generated by reports.cgi were saved into a common directory ('./graphs'), not a project-specific directory. This allowed an attacker to view graphs from other projects by simply browsing to the directory or knowing/guessing the predictable file names.\n\nThe fix implemented involves:\n1. Preventing direct browsing of the graphs/ directory by implementing proper access controls.\n2. Generating random filenames for the graphs to prevent brute-forcing.\n3. Basing filenames on product IDs instead of product names to avoid issues with product renaming.\n4. Using the project ID in the filename hash to ensure unique names for different Bugzilla projects using the same product names.\n5. Fixing status/resolution string concatenation to avoid issues when colons are present in bug statuses or resolutions."
