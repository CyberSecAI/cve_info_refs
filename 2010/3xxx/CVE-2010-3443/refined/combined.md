* **% Done** changed from *0* to *100*

If we receive multiple CTCP requests in one PRIVMSG we now answer with one packed NOTICE containing all CTCP replies. This fixes a possible DoS Attack rendering Quassels IRC connection useless. Upgrading is strongly recommended. Thanks to Jima for reporting and supporting.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Quassel: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **201311-03**

Two vulnerabilities in Quassel may result in Denial of Service or
SQL injection.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/quassel** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.1** |

### Background

Quassel is a Qt4/KDE4 IRC client suppporting a remote daemon for 24/7
connectivity.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been found in Quassel:

* Quassel does not properly handle multiple CTCP requests
  (CVE-2010-3443).
* Quassel, when used with certain versions of Qt and PostgreSQL, does
  not sanitize user input (CVE-2013-4422).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send multiple CTCP requests in single private
message, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service condition. Futhermore,
a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary SQL statements.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Quassel users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/quassel-0.9.1"

```

This issue is also the reason for the 0.7.0 release being officially skipped. People still on 0.6.x and not wanting to update to a new feature release should upgrade to [version 0.6.3](/pub/quassel-0.6.3.tar.bz2) in which this issue is fixed as well.  Now read on for a short list of the major new features [the 0.7 flavour](/pub/quassel-0.7.1.tar.bz2) gives you, besides a ton of bugfixes and translation improvements!   * Improved Desktop Environment integration: We now properly support DBusMenu (which gives you a proper tray menu in both GNOME and KDE), improved Ayatana support, and fixed some issues with StatusNotifier * Editable shortcuts for all platforms, not only KDE * Shortcuts for navigation between chats (Alt+Left/Right/Up/Down) -- though there are still some known bugs there * Emacs-style keybindings for the input line * Marker line can now be set manually (Ctrl+R), and one can jump directly to the marker line (Ctrl+K) * Blowfish encryption (via /setkey and /delkey), also known as mircryption, FiSH or RFC 2045 * Fullscreen mode * New languages: Greek, Galician, Japanese   You can grab [the tarball](/pub/quassel-0.7.1.tar.bz2) and the usual binary packages on our [download page](/downloads).  Now on to rewriting most of the core on the road to scripting support! ~ Sputnick  »  * [Sputnick's blog](/blog/1 "Read Sputnick's latest blog entries.") |

* **Status** changed from *New* to *Resolved*
* **% Done** changed from *0* to *100*

If we receive multiple CTCP requests in one PRIVMSG we now answer with one packed NOTICE containing all CTCP replies. This fixes a possible DoS Attack rendering Quassels IRC connection useless. Upgrading is strongly recommended. Thanks to Jima for reporting and supporting.
