  "description": "The ethtool interface did not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could read kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The ethtool_get_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory",
       "Information Leak"
    ],

      "ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command"

  "additionalDetails": {
    "ubuntu": "Kees Cook discovered that the ethtool interface did not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could read kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.",
   "opensuse": "The ethtool_get_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information via an ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule_cnt value."
