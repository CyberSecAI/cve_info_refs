{
  "CVE-2010-3301": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel on 64 bit systems does not correctly filter registers when performing 32bit system calls. A local attacker can manipulate 32bit system calls to gain root privileges.",
    "Root cause": "Mismatch between 32bit and 64bit register usage in the system call entry path.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect register handling during 32-bit system calls on 64-bit kernels"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation to root.",
    "Attack vectors": "Manipulating 32-bit system calls on a 64-bit system.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access to the system."
  }
