Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-3489

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `goback` parameter within the `login2.php` script of Netautor Professional 5.5.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application takes user-provided data in the `goback` parameter and includes it in the HTML output without proper encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the `goback` parameter. When a user visits the crafted URL, this code executes within the context of their browser session on the affected site.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites, possibly leading to malware installation.
*   **Phishing:** An attacker could present a modified login page to steal user credentials.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker could deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based:** An attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `goback` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker lures a user into clicking the malicious link, or in the case of a stored attack the vulnerability is stored in the web application itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and to get a victim to access the malicious link or store the attack inside the web application itself.
*   No special privileges or access to the system are required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Netautor Professional 5.5.0, and also affects Digital Workroom 5.3.1 as it's based on the vulnerable platform.
*   The advisory includes code snippets highlighting where the vulnerable `goback` parameter is used.
*   The advisory includes a PoC (Proof of Concept) that confirms the vulnerability.
*   The vendor was contacted but did not respond before public disclosure, as of the date of the advisory.
