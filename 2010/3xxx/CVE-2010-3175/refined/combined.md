# USN-998-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

20 October 2010

Thunderbird could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - mail/news client with RSS and integrated spam filter support

## Details

Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov, Josh Soref, Gary

Kwong, Martijn Wargers, Siddharth Agarwal and Michal Zalewski discovered

various flaws in the browser engine. An attacker could exploit this to

crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-3175](/security/CVE-2010-3175), [CVE-2010-3176](/security/CVE-2010-3176))

Alexander Miller, Sergey Glazunov, and others discovered several flaws in

the JavaScript engine. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker could

exploit this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3179](/security/CVE-2010-3179), [CVE-2010-3180](/security/CVE-2010-3180), [CVE-2010-3183](/security/CVE-2010-3183))

Eduardo Vela Nava discovered that Thunderbird could be made to violate the

same-origin policy by using modal calls with JavaScript. If JavaScript were

enabled, an attacker could exploit this to steal information from another

site. ([CVE-2010-3178](/security/CVE-2010-3178))

Dmitri GribenkoDmitri Gribenko discovered that Thunderbird did not properly

setup the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable. A local attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3182](/security/CVE-2010-3182))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [3.1.5+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/3.1.5%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [3.0.9+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/3.0.9%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make all

the necessary changes.

firefox security update (RHSA-2010-0782)

Original Release Date: November 16, 2010

Last Revised: June 21, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-321

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 7.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox. Network Security Services (NSS) is
a set of libraries designed to support the development of security-enabled
client and server applications.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2010-3175](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3175.html),
[CVE-2010-3176](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3176.html),
[CVE-2010-3179](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3179.html),
[CVE-2010-3183](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3183.html) and
[CVE-2010-3180](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3180.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in Firefox converted text
into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
a victim running Firefox, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the
context of the Gopher domain. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3177](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3177.html) to this issue.

A same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Firefox. An attacker could
create a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal
private data from a different website the victim has loaded with Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3178](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3178.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the script that launches Firefox. The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
Firefox, if that user ran Firefox from within an attacker-controlled
directory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3182.html) to this issue.

It was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode
implementation for key exchanges in Firefox accepted DHE keys that were 256
bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as such
keys are easily broken using modern hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3173](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3173.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way NSS matched SSL certificates when the
certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
address. NSS incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that fell
within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3170](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3170.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
When certain factors determine that the overall risk for a particular product to be set to Low,
Avaya will place these factors in the following table:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-3170 CVE-2010-3173 CVE-2010-3175 CVE-2010-3176 CVE-2010-3177 CVE-2010-3178 CVE-2010-3179 CVE-2010-3180 CVE-2010-3182 CVE-2010-3183 | These vulnerabilities are rated a Low risk as firefox is not a critical application on IALX, MN and MSS and is not installed on AES, CM, Conferencing, IQ, Presence, SM, SMGR, SP, VP or the CS1000. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |

I think this is an sg:dos null deref. The crash-stacks on windows point at an uninteresting line 1077, but I think the optimizer is playing games with the loops. In mac debug and opt builds build I crash just after calling GetLength() on a null mTextRun. I don't understand why I don't crash calling mTextRun->IsClusterStart(limit) first though.
In the debug build it ran quite a long time before crashing. Is it possible we're reusing a dead object that just happens to have nulls in an opt build?

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=590291&attachment=471012)

the CharacterIterator tries to create the mTextRun so that needs to come first. In this case even that does not set a mTextRun since we go into an error state with mInError = true. Chicken and egg at first sight since you need to advance to detect the error and you need a text run to figure out where to advance to but you can just advance to the beginning of the string and then figure out whether you need to advance any more later.

Is that it for me in the brave new world of security fixes being checked in by the security group? The patch should apply to both trunk and 1.9.2 though you may need to fuzz things a little for the branch.

Is cross\_fuzz public? I thought it wasn't and I don't know with whom you've shared it. Didn't want to start a deluge of "why won't you share it with \_me\_?" requests headed your way.
Should we add a note like the ones in MFSA 2010-49 and MFSA 2010-59 every time we fix a crossfuzz-found bug? Forever? Until the fuzzer is public?

It's not public, it's shared with all the major browser vendors (as all are affected). I certainly don't mind a deluge of requests (if there's one thing I'm good at, it's turning people down).
It's no big deal, really; it'd be cool to get a customary acknowledgment on fixed bugs, as it's pretty much the currency in the open source infosec world - but it's your call, depending on how much you believe cross\_fuzz actually contributed to spotting the flaw, etc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-64

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:1.9.2.11/ 1.9.1.14)

Announced
October 19, 2010
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.14
* Firefox 3.6.11
* SeaMonkey 2.0.9
* Thunderbird 3.0.9
* Thunderbird 3.1.5

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References

Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov and Josh
Soref reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
Firefox 3.5.

It would be nice if this were fixed, so I could look for textframe assertions again. I have to ignore a bunch of them because of this known bug.Flags: blocking1.9.2?

The null deref in testcase 2 is now covered by [bug 515771](/show_bug.cgi?id=515771 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Data from Faulting Address controls Branch Selection star ting at gklayout!nsTextFrameUtils::TransformText+0x00000000000000cc"), this bug can be about the assertions.
Unless this bug is saying the assertions are incorrect, "integer overflow" sounds like a security bug that needs hiding.Group: core-security

The bug here is that MathML's quote-setting is rather naive:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// For <ms>, it is assumed that the mathml.css file contains two rules:
// ms:before { content: open-quote; }
// ms:after { content: close-quote; }
// With these two rules, the frame construction code will
// create inline frames that contain text frames which themselves
// contain the text content of the quotes.
// So the main idea in this code is to see if there are lquote and
// rquote attributes. If these are there, we ovewrite the default
// quotes in the text frames.
However, due to RTL and line-breaking the anonymous content for :before and :after can actually comprise multiple frames each, which is what's happening here.

This fixes it. It turns out that because of changes to the frame tree since this was first implemented, rquote doesn't work at all on trunk. So I'm adding a test that lquote and rquote actually work.

BTW lquote and rquote should really be implemented by mapping into a style rule somehow, but I don't want to invest in that right now.

This caused reftest failures on 1.9.1 on all platforms. See:

SeaMonkey2.0 shows the exact same reftest failures, so it's surely not a one-off.

Can we bump this to the next release? I don't have time to work out why the test failed on branch. It's probably something simple though.

So, I think I shouldn't have landed this at all, since it has caused the same orange as [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=476547#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrameUtils::TransformText] with MathML, lquote, CSS quotes property").
I backed it out: <http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/801b22550e2e>
I think roc meant to switch the blocking flag to ? in [comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=476547#c16 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsTextFrameUtils::TransformText] with MathML, lquote, CSS quotes property").blocking1.9.1: .11+ → ?

1.9.1 patch
I'm going to minus this patch for 1.9.1.11 because we'll need some sort of test fix. If you create a merged patch we can approve that, if it's just an additive test patch we can approve both. We'll wait for the explicit .12 requests to know which way to go.

OK, the problem was simply that reftests on 1.9.1 don't support the MozReftestInvalidate event, so the test doesn't run properly.
Fixed that by doing a setTimeout after onload instead. It won't necessarily test dynamic updates reliably, but that doesn't matter.
This is ready to land.

There's missing NULL check for quoteContent which was in the original code:
- if (quoteContent && quoteContent->IsNodeOfType(nsINode::eTEXT)) {
[...]
+ if (!quoteContent->IsNodeOfType(nsINode::eTEXT))
Is it an intended change?

Core :: Graphics: ImageLib
ImageLib decodes GIF, JPEG and PNG images, and provides the decoded data to the Compositor for display. If Firefox or Seamonkey can display an image when loaded separately from the page, ImageLib is working, and the actual imaging bug exists elsewhere within Firefox or Seamonkey.

Examples of appropriate bugs: PNG gAMA chunk ignored; Crashes on GIF w/corrupted frame(merr-01.gif); or PNGs and JPEGs aren't displayed on FreeBSD.

I can reproduce this on the official builds: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b3) Gecko/20100805 Firefox/4.0b3 as well as on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b5pre) Gecko/20100823 Minefield/4.0b5pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729). However, I can't reproduce this on a debug build, either VC8 or VC10.
A call in nsIconChannel::MakeInputStream [1] to Win32's GetDIBits [2] seems to clobber the stack on returning. This happens whenever this point in code is reached. In most cases those locations aren't touched any more. However, in at least one case at least one location is -- when stockIcon [3] contains a shared string, during its destruction that value on the stack (now 0x00ffffff) is used.
An easy way to trigger a crash on Windows 7 using it is to load the URL moz-icon://stock/uac-shield. This immediately causes a crash, e.g. [4], which I submitted.

There doesn't seem to be anything obviously wrong with the API calls. This might be something hidden in the API or a codegen/PGO bug.

Not sure, but at least the crash doesn't happen with 3.6.8.
However it seems we've been using the API incorrectly all this while -- the BITMAPINFO structure [1] actually expects an array of RGBQUADs rather an a single RGBQUAD. The number of RGBQUADs is determined by biBitCount and biClrUsed [2]. A mask has 1 bit per pixel, which means according to [2] that bmiColors has to contain two entries, not the one you would get by allocating on the stack. This results in the four bytes right after maskInfo being overwritten.

we did see a bump in this signature shortly after the release of beta1 around July 7 going from 15-25 crashes per day before 7/7 to 30-55 crashes per day after 7/7. then we started to see a decline again around July 27.
peak volume day was july 15. here is the breakdown of releases for this signature on that day.

Given that this would involve me investigating things on windows (not my native platform - I have a VM, but not really a development environment), I don't really have the bandwidth for it right now. Maybe in a few weeks? Or maybe joe could look at it?

Here's one possible way to fix it. The variable length of BITMAPINFO means that we'll need to allocate it on the heap.
I'm still not sure whether the colour table should never be part of the icon. (If I do include it with a 32-bit icon, the image doesn't come out right, so I removed it.)

We should probably use fallible alloc here, because this is a user-controlled, mostly arbitrarily-large size. I know that'll complicate things and add error handling, though. The style here is also to use new[]/delete[], so it might not be a bad thing to use fallible new[].
Looks good otherwise, but this also needs sr.

Possible fix, v1.01
Looks good to me, though most of the patch seems to be some cleanup (using a BITMAPINFOHEADER instead of a BITMAPINFO), with the core change happening in the last hunk. I don't have anything against the cleanup, but would be nice to split it up into two separate changesets for better inspectability.

The size of the pointer is statically unknown, and I'd rather do a malloc than a new char[].

Oh, I only did that because a statically allocated BITMAPINFO is 4 bytes larger than just the header, and at that stage just the header's required.

Hmm, I noticed one potential issue my patch could introduce. We could convince ourselves to allocate a potentially unbounded amount of memory if the header is malformed and has a strange value for aHeader->biClrUsed. Is failing the right thing to do here?

This works.
As for 1.9.1, it seems to be unaffected by the bug, but entirely by accident. In <<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.1/source/modules/libpr0n/decoders/icon/win/nsIconChannel.cpp?mark=497-505#497>>, the pointer that's passed in for the bitmap info is an offset of the buffer itself, so I think it first writes the colour table out, then overwrites it with the actual bitmap.

patch for 1.9.2
Approved for 1.9.2.11, a=dveditz
Does this patch work for 1.9.1.x too, or do we need a different version there?

- 1.9.1 is unaffected by the actual corruption issue by accident, as I mentioned in [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=590116#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stack corruption in Windows' nsIconChannel::MakeInputStream due to GetDIBits being incorrectly used").
- The 1.9.1 code is completely different, so if we do decide to explicitly fix it there we'll have to write a completely different patch.

I haven't been able to do anything worse than a denial of service, and I think DEP + ASLR would protect against this, so this bug might not be eligible. On the other hand, the executable is 32-bit only, so one might in theory be able to brute-force one's way past ASLR easily.

Of course, ASLR isn't present on Windows XP.

... and Win2k doesn't have DEP, and we still support it. Never mind. :)

Yuck. The problem is that the tracer expects arguments[n] to be undefined if |n| is out of range. In this case, it is \_not\_ undefined, it is NaN, because the interpreter did this:
arguments[4] = undefined \* 0Group: core-security

You're right - it occurs on TM tip with -j. In the past, it used to assert at:
Assertion failed: ((unsigned)r)<8 (../nanojit/Nativei386.cpp:427)
or
Assertion failed: s0->isQuad() && s1->isQuad() (../nanojit/LIR.cpp:2182)
before morphing to the current form.

dvander and I talked this over, and we think all that it takes to fix this is to abort tracing a getelem with arguments (args[expr]) if the index is a constant that is out of range. The tracer already aborts if the index is a non-constant that is out of range, so this just makes things consistent.
ETA = patch up for review later today.

Why did this just land on 1.9.2 without approval? This isn't a new policy, and I've said this before. All branch patches must have explicit approval before landing. blocking+ is not enough.

It's set to blocking 1.9.2.11. I don't even know why am answering this nonsense.
