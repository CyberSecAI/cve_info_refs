  "CVE-2010-3614": {
    "description": "It was discovered that, in certain cases, named did not properly perform DNSSEC validation of an NS RRset for zones in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm rollover. This flaw could cause the validator to incorrectly determine that the zone is insecure and not protected by DNSSEC.",
    "root_cause": "named did not properly perform DNSSEC validation of an NS RRset for zones in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm rollover.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper DNSSEC validation",
	  "Incorrectly determining that a zone is insecure"
    ],
    "impact": "The validator incorrectly determines that the zone is insecure and not protected by DNSSEC.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "DNS Response manipulation during a DNSKEY algorithm rollover."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker who can manipulate DNS responses during a DNSKEY algorithm rollover.",
	"additional_information": "This vulnerability was found in BIND. The vulnerability can cause zone unavailability during rollovers.  Multiple trust anchors do not need to be configured for the zone for this vulnerability to be triggered."
