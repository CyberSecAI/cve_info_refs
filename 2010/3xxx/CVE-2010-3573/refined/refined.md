Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3573:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `HttpURLConnection` class of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Development Kit (JDK). This class does not properly validate request headers set by Java applets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of request headers within `HttpURLConnection` when used by applets. This allows applets to set arbitrary headers.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** A remote attacker could exploit this to trigger actions that are otherwise restricted to legitimate HTTP clients. 
*   **Code execution** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the applet or application.
*   **Information disclosure** A remote attacker could potentially access information about otherwise-protected internal network names by exploiting flaws in the JNDI.
*   **Denial of Service**  A remote attacker could cause a denial of service condition on the receiving JVM by improperly checking AP-REQ requests.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, allowing an attacker to send malicious requests over the network.
*   **Java applets:** The attack vector involves the use of untrusted Java applets to exploit the vulnerability. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** No physical access is needed.
*   **Ability to deploy malicious Java applets:** The attacker needs to be able to deploy and have users run a malicious applet.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update for October 2010, as well as in updates for various Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu and SUSE.
*   The vulnerability is associated with multiple other CVEs relating to various aspects of the Java platform, all patched in the same update (most of the documents discuss multiple CVEs as part of the same security update).
*   The vulnerability is a moderate security risk, as per Red Hat's assessment, but is also reported as a critical risk in the Oracle advisory
*   The vulnerability affects multiple products, including those from Oracle and VMWare.
*   VMWare's advisory notes that the version of the Oracle (Sun) JRE is updated to 1.5.0_26 or 1.6.0_21 to address this and other vulnerabilities.

In summary, CVE-2010-3573 is related to insufficient input validation in the `HttpURLConnection` class of Java, enabling a remote attacker leveraging a malicious java applet to potentially cause significant impact on a vulnerable system.
