## Analysis of CVE-2010-3067

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Integer overflow in the `do_io_submit` function within the `fs/aio.c` file of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `access_ok()` macro used to validate memory access before reading user-supplied data is susceptible to an overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication `(nr * sizeof(*iocbpp))` within `access_ok()` can overflow if `nr` (number of I/O control blocks) is sufficiently large. This bypasses the intended bounds check.
- **Unsafe User Data Handling:** The code then uses `__get_user_nocheck()`, which is not safe if `access_ok` did not perform a correct validation due to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:**  An attacker can cause a denial of service by causing an integer overflow which leads to the system crashing (kernel panic or OOPS).
- **Unspecified Other Impact:** The vulnerability description mentions "possibly have unspecified other impact", likely referring to the potential for arbitrary memory corruption/overwrite if combined with other vulnerabilities

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** A local user with the ability to use the `io_submit` system call is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the target system.
- **Ability to use io_submit syscall:** Requires permission to make the `io_submit` system call, which is generally available.

**Technical Details:**

- The `io_submit` system call directly invokes the `do_io_submit` function.
- The `do_io_submit` function checks for `nr < 0` but does not check for overflow in the `access_ok` calculation.
- The vulnerable code is within this `do_io_submit` function:
  ```c
  long do_io_submit(aio_context_t ctx_id, long nr,
            struct iocb __user *__user *iocbpp, bool compat) {
  ...
      if (unlikely(!access_ok(VERIFY_READ, iocbpp, (nr*sizeof(*iocbpp)))))
          return -EFAULT;
  ...
      for (i=0; i<nr; i++) {
          struct iocb __user *user_iocb;
          struct iocb tmp;

          if (unlikely(__get_user(user_iocb, iocbpp + i))) {
              ret = -EFAULT;
              break;
          }
  ...
  ```

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Tavis Ormandy.
- A patch for this vulnerability was released and is referenced in several of the security advisories and bug reports.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple Linux distributions like openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, and SUSE Linux Enterprise.

**Summary of CVE-2010-3067 from the analyzed content:**

The vulnerability is due to an integer overflow in the `do_io_submit` function of the Linux kernel. A local user can exploit this using crafted use of the `io_submit` system call to cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impacts. This is achieved by providing a large value for `nr` which causes the size calculation in access_ok to overflow bypassing the check and resulting in memory corruption when attempting to read data pointed to by `iocbpp`.
