Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-3484

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user input in the `LightNEasy CMS` login function. Specifically, the `$_POST['handle']` variable is used directly in an SQL query without prior sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. This is a blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker doesn't receive direct output from the query but can infer information based on the server's response time (using `BENCHMARK()` to cause delays).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by crafting specific SQL injection payloads. In this case, the proof-of-concept targets the admin user's password hash.
- **Authentication Bypass/Account Takeover:** Once the password hash is retrieved, an attacker can crack the hash and use the stolen credentials to log in and gain control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the login page (`LightNEasy.php?do=login`).
- **Malicious `handle` Parameter:** The attack payload is injected through the `handle` parameter in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker should understand HTTP POST requests, URL parameters, and SQL syntax to construct a successful attack.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability is located within the login functionality, so no prior user authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Technical Details (from the exploit-db content):**
- The vulnerable code is in `common.php` within the login function
```php
function login() {
	global $message, $set, $langmessage, $prefix;
	if($_SESSION[$set['password']]!="1") {
	if($_GET['do']=="login" && $_POST['handle']!="") {
		$result=dbquery('SELECT * FROM '.$prefix.'users WHERE handle="'.$_POST['handle'].'"');
		if($row = fetch_array($result)) {
			if($row['password'] == sha1($_POST['password'])) {
					...

}}}}}
```
- **Exploit Example:**
  ```
  URL: http://localhost/LNE/LightNEasy.php?do=login
  Postdata:
  handle=" UNION SELECT IF(SUBSTRING(password,1 ,1) = CHAR(98), BENCHMARK(1000000, ENCODE('Slow','Down')), null),2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 FROM lne_users WHERE id="1&password=&do=login&=Login
  ```
  This specific payload uses the `BENCHMARK` function to cause a delay if the first character of the admin's password hash is "b", allowing the attacker to guess the hash character by character.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the LightNEasy CMS login page caused by insufficient input sanitization. This allows an attacker to potentially retrieve password hashes and gain unauthorized access. The exploit-db content provides technical details, including the vulnerable code snippet, and a proof-of-concept exploit showing how to extract the admin user's password hash.
