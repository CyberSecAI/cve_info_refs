  "cveId": "CVE-2010-3080",
  "description": "The provided documents describe a vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to the /dev/sequencer device, where an error during device opening can lead to a double free and a use-after-free condition.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the `snd_seq_oss_open` function within the Linux kernel's sound subsystem. Specifically, when the /dev/sequencer device fails to open, the error handling path includes a call to `delete_port(dp)` which, due to a callback mechanism, frees the memory of the `seq_oss_devinfo` structure. Later in the error path, code attempts to access the same structure again, resulting in a use-after-free. Additionally, another call, kfree(dp),  attempts to free the same memory a second time causing a double free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
       "Double free",
      "Improper error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can exploit this flaw to trigger a kernel crash (denial of service), and potentially escalate privileges.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access to the /dev/sequencer device",
      "Triggering the error path during the opening of the device"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system, and the ability to attempt to open the `/dev/sequencer` device in a manner that triggers the error condition."
  },
    "affectedConfigurations":[
        "Multiple Linux distributions (e.g., Red Hat, Ubuntu, SUSE, openSUSE)",
        "Linux kernel versions prior to the fix"
    ],
  "additionalNotes": "The vulnerability is triggered in the error path, so simply attempting to open the device may not be enough. The specific error condition that triggers the vulnerability must occur, which might be dependent on the configuration of the system. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5 were not vulnerable because they did not include the upstream commit that introduced the issue. Red Hat Enterprise MRG was not affected because access to the /dev/sequencer device is restricted to the root user."
