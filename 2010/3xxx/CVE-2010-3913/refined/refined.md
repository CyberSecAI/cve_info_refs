Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in Active! mail 6, which allows for HTTP header injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Header Injection:** The software fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input that is used to construct HTTP headers. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary headers into the HTTP response.
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The root cause is specifically identified as improper input validation, which is a common cause for injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Falsified Information Display:** An attacker can manipulate the HTTP response headers to display falsified information to the user within their web browser.
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By injecting malicious headers, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary scripts within the user's browser (cross-site scripting).
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** The vulnerability allows for HTTP response splitting attacks, which can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions, including cache poisoning and cross-site scripting.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network, meaning it doesn't require local access to the server.
- **HTTP Requests:**  The attack is likely carried out by crafting malicious HTTP requests that include crafted input designed to inject harmful data into the HTTP response headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication, which means an unauthenticated attacker can exploit it.
- **User Interaction:** While exploitation is done over the network, the impact often requires user interaction to realize (e.g., clicking a link with injected content or viewing a manipulated page). This is qualified as "Medium" severity user interaction in one of the reports as the user is expected to take a standard action such as clicking a link or viewing a file.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in Active! mail 6 Build 6.40.010047750 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is publicly known and has been assigned CVE-2010-3913.
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Taketo Ikeuchi of Hitachi Solutions, Ltd.

The provided information gives a clear understanding of how the HTTP header injection vulnerability works, how it can be exploited, and its potential impact.
