      "Root cause": "A crash occurs due to improper handling of frame destruction when using -moz-column and position:absolute. Specifically, when destroying frames in reverse order from a list of frames to be destroyed, descendants of a frame that are already destroyed can be added to the destroy queue, leading to crashes when they are later processed.  The code relies on skipping out-of-flow child lists, and expects to find all relevant placeholders in subtrees of top frame continuations.  After a fix for a prior bug, this assumption became false and out-of-flow overflow containers were not correctly handled.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect assumption about the frame tree structure when using -moz-column and position:absolute.",
        "Failure to properly process next-in-flows other than for the top frame during destruction."
      ],
       "Impact": "A crash due to dereferencing a freed memory location when processing a frame that is already dead during frame destruction.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a crafted HTML page that includes -moz-column and position:absolute styles.",
      "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted HTML page to the victim's browser to trigger the crash."
