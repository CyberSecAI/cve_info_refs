  "CVE-2010-3442": {
    "description": "The snd_ctl_new() function in sound/core/control.c allocates space for a snd_kcontrol struct by performing arithmetic operations on a user-provided size without checking for integer overflow.  If a user provides a large enough size, an overflow will occur, the allocated chunk will be too small, and a second user-influenced value will be written repeatedly past the bounds of this chunk. This code is reachable by unprivileged users who have permission to open a /dev/snd/controlC* device (on many distros, this is group \"audio\") via the SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD and SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE ioctls.",
