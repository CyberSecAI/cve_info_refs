{
  "CVE-2010-3832": {
    "Description": "A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) fields in GSM mobility management. This may allow a remote attacker to cause arbitrary code execution on the baseband processor. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking.",
    "Root cause": "Heap buffer overflow in the handling of Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI) fields in GSM mobility management.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the baseband processor.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted GSM mobility management packet.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Remote attacker with the ability to send malicious GSM packets."
