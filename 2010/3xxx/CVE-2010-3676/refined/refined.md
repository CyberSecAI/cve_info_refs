Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3676:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a race condition that occurs when concurrently changing InnoDB storage engine configuration parameters (`innodb_file_format` and `innodb_file_per_table`) and issuing Data Definition Language (DDL) statements like `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE`.
- A change in the `dict_build_table_def_step()` function, specifically the extraction of `dict_hdr_get_new_id()` outside of `fil_create_new_single_table_tablespace()`, exposed the vulnerability.
- When `srv_file_per_table` is initially 0, `space` is not fetched, and later when it switches to true it leads to assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition:** Concurrent access and modification of InnoDB configuration settings and DDL operations create a race condition where the server state is inconsistent.
- **Assertion failure:** This inconsistency leads to an assertion failure in `fil_create_new_single_table_tablespace()` due to an invalid `space_id`, causing the server to crash.
- **Use of uninitialized value:** The `space` variable within the function, when `srv_file_per_table` is initially false, can remain uninitialized, leading to issues when the value changes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a server crash (mysqld daemon abort), leading to a temporary denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote, authenticated user:**  A remote, authenticated MySQL user can trigger the vulnerability by establishing multiple parallel connections.
- **Concurrent operations:** Simultaneously sending `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` statements on one connection and altering the `innodb_file_format` and `innodb_file_per_table` settings on another triggers the race condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the MySQL server.
- **Multiple connections:** The attacker needs to be able to create multiple concurrent connections.
- **Privileges:** The attacker needs to have the `SUPER` privilege to change the global `innodb_file_format` and `innodb_file_per_table` settings.

**Technical Details:**
- The assertion failure occurs at `fil0fil.c:2618` or `fil0fil.c:2600` where it is checked if `space_id > 0` and crashes when it is not.
- The vulnerability exists in versions 5.1.49, 5.5.5-m3, and 5.5.6-m3 but is a regression introduced after 5.5.4-m3.
- The vulnerability also exists in 5.1 as it uses the same code, though this was discovered later.
- The patch involves checking for a `ULINT_UNDEFINED` space value to avoid the assertion failure.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided MTR test case demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability reliably.
- The issue did not affect the versions of the mysql package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Fedora 12 was not affected while Fedora 13 was affected.
- The issue was fixed in MySQL versions 5.1.49, 5.1.51, 5.5.6-m3, 5.6.1-m4, and their respective maintenance releases.
