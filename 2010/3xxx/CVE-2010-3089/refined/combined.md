Hash: SHA1

I plan to release a Mailman 2.1.14 candidate release towards the end of
next week (Sept 9 or 10). This release will have enhanced XSS defenses
addressing two recently discovered vulnerabilities. Since release of the
code will potentially expose the vulnerabilities, I plan to publish a
patch against the 2.1.13 base with the fix before actually releasing the
2.1.14 candidate.

I will post the patch to the same 4 lists that this post is being sent
to in the early afternoon, GMT, on September 9.

The vulnerabilities are obscure and can only be exploited by a list
owner, but if you are concerned about them you can plan to install the
patch.

The patch is small (34 line diff), only affects two modules and doesn't
require a Mailman restart to be effective, although I would recommend a
restart as soon as convenient after applying the patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : mailman
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3089 CVE-2011-0707

Two cross site scripting vulnerabilities were been discovered in
Mailman, a web-based mailing list manager. These allowed an attacker
to retreive session cookies via inserting crafted JavaScript into
confirmation messages (CVE-2011-0707) and in the list admin interface
(CVE-2010-3089; oldstable only).

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1.11-11+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.13-5.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 1:2.1.14-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.

# USN-1069-1: Mailman vulnerabilities

22 February 2011

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mailman](/security/cves?package=mailman) -

## Details

It was discovered that Mailman did not properly sanitize certain fields,

resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server

output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit

this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same

domain.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The patch is attached. Since it only affects the web CGIs, it can be
applied and will be effective without restarting Mailman, although since
it includes a patch to Utils.py which is imported by the qrunners, a
restart of Mailman is advisable as soon as convenient after applying the
patch.

A security flaw was found in the way Mailman mailing list manager sanitized content of mailing list information HTML template, prior rendering it to the user. A remote mailing list owner could use this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (execute arbitrary HTML or scripting code) when the modified "listinfo" html page is viewed by the user.  2. A security flaw was found in the way Mailman mailing list manager sanitized mailing list description by presenting general mailing list information. A remote mailing list owner could use this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (execute arbitrary HTML or scripting code).

In this case, all else being equal, lowest ID wins.

We will never be perfect due to the lack of sufficient details (or, way
too many details), but where possible I prefer to follow the consistency
rules when we can, especially when they're pretty clear-cut like this.

It happens :-)

In this case, the abstraction issue was discovered quickly, so I'm OK with
fixing the abstraction after the fact.

Let's stick with CVE-2010-3089, and I'll flag CVE-2010-3090 for rejection.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Release notes

Security

- Two potential XSS vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed.

New Features

- A new feature for controlling the addition/replacement of the Sender:

      header in outgoing mail has been implemented. This allows a list owner

      to set include\_sender\_header on the list's General Options page in the

      admin GUI. The default for this setting is Yes which preserves the prior

      behavior of removing any pre-existing Sender: and setting it to the

      list's -bounces address. Setting this to No stops Mailman from adding or

      modifying the Sender: at all.

Additionally, there is a new Defaults.py/mm\_cfg.py setting

      ALLOW\_SENDER\_OVERRIDES which defaults to Yes but which can be set to No

      to remove the include\_sender\_header setting from General Options, and

      thus preserve the prior behavior completely.

- Bounce processing has been enhanced so that if a bounce is returned to a

      list from a non-member who is a member of a regular\_include\_list, the

      bounce will be processed as a bounce for the included list.

I have no idea why I did that now that I look at the bugs. I'm sorry.

I'll let you pick which ID to use (do you have a policy for this? lowest

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,

There are two mailman vulns. fixed by the following patch:
<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-announce/2010-September/000151.html>

Particular Red Hat Bugzilla entries are the following:

	<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=631881>
	<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=631859>
