Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3829:

**Summary:**

CVE-2010-3829 relates to a vulnerability in the Mail component of iOS where DNS prefetching occurs even when remote image loading is disabled. This allows an attacker to potentially track whether an email has been viewed.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from WebKit's behavior when encountering an HTML Link Element requesting DNS prefetching. WebKit performs the prefetch regardless of whether remote image loading is disabled by the user.
*   **Weakness:**  The primary weakness is that the DNS prefetching mechanism bypasses the user's preference for disabling remote image loading. This leads to information leakage.
*   **Impact:** The primary impact is the potential for tracking email views without the user's consent, leading to privacy concerns. Attackers can use this to confirm whether a sent HTML email has been opened by the recipient. It does not lead to code execution or system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTML-formatted email containing a Link Element that triggers a DNS prefetch for a controlled domain.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker needs the capability to send an HTML-formatted email and have a domain under their control to track requests. No specific privileged network access is required by the attacker.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The description states, "When WebKit encounters an HTML Link Element that requests DNS prefetching, it will perform the prefetch even if remote image loading is disabled. This may result in undesired requests to remote servers. The sender of an HTML-formatted email message could use this to determine whether the message was viewed."
*   The fix involves "disabling DNS prefetching when remote image loading is disabled."

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Apple support document specifically identifies Mike Cardwell of Cardwell IT Ltd. as reporting this issue.
* The opensuse.org content also lists CVE-2010-3829 as a vulnerability fixed in libwebkit as part of SUSE Security Summary Report SUSE-SR:2011:002
