{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application loads a DLL file (dwmapi.dll) from the same directory as an affected file type (snag, snagcc, or snagprof), instead of relying on the system's DLL search path. This can be exploited by placing a malicious DLL file with the same name in the same directory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "DLL Hijacking vulnerability, insecure DLL loading.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. In this case, the provided exploit code executes the Windows calculator application as a proof of concept.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local. An attacker needs to place a specially crafted dwmapi.dll file into the same directory as a targeted file of type snag, snagcc, or snagprof.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to write files to the same directory where a user will execute or open a vulnerable file type of the Snagit application."
