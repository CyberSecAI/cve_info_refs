Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-3922:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in Movable Type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This allows an attacker to insert malicious SQL code into database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While not the main focus, the provided release notes for Movable Type 5.04 and 4.35 also mention a fix for XSS vulnerabilities, indicating that XSS issues also existed in prior versions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** A remote attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the Movable Type database.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify data within the database, potentially leading to data corruption, defacement, or unauthorized actions.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Via XSS):** As noted in the release notes, XSS vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the browser of a logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is over the network, meaning that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending malicious requests to the Movable Type application.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject SQL commands into vulnerable input fields or URL parameters to gain control over database queries, potentially leading to data exposure and manipulation.
*   **XSS:** Through XSS, attackers can inject scripts into web pages viewed by users, resulting in malicious actions on the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access (SQLi):**  The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
*  **Remote, Authenticated User (XSS):** The attacker needs to inject malicious javascript that is executed in the browser of an authenticated user.
*   **Knowledge of Movable Type:** The attacker needs knowledge of how Movable Type works to understand how to inject malicious code and successfully execute the attack.

**Affected Versions:**
* Movable Type Open Source 4.x
* Movable Type Open Source 5.x
* Movable Type 4.x (with Professional Pack, Community Pack)
* Movable Type 5.x (with Professional Pack, Community Pack)
* Movable Type Enterprise 4.x
* Specifically: Movable Type Open Source 5.031 and earlier, Movable Type 5.031 (includes Professional and Community Packs) and earlier, Movable Type Advanced 5.031 and earlier.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was addressed in Movable Type 5.04 and 4.35.
* The severity was rated as "Medium" by the JVN.
