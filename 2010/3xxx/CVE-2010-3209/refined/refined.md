- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `includeFile` and `driverpath` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary file paths, leading to remote file inclusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or complete compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files with malicious paths in the `includeFile` or `driverpath` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific position or privilege is required.
