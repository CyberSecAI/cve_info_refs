{
  "CVE-2010-3894": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in IBM OmniFind.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by copying a password value to a fixed-size buffer of 2048 bytes without proper bounds checking in the `Java_com_ibm_es_oss_CryptionNative_ESEncrypt()` function within `libffq.cryptionjni.so`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service or, with further exploitation, remote code execution, potentially leading to a root shell due to the application running as root.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote",
       "The login form of the administrative interface is the attack vector."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the administrative interface and enter a long password string to trigger the overflow. The attacker can also leverage the overflow to overwrite the return address and execute arbitrary code.",
    "Additional details": "There are two attack points to exploit this buffer overflow: one based on controlling EAX and EDI registers for arbitrary address writing, and another based on overwriting the return address (EIP). The second attack is restricted to printable ASCII values only. The input via the first attack point is not filtered, allowing arbitrary values. Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a remote (root) shell."
