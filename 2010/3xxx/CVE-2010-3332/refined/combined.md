# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# [Microsoft Security Advisory for ASP.NET](/forums/diary/Microsoft%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2Bfor%2BASPNET/9568/)

**Published**: 2010-09-18. **Last Updated**: 2010-09-18 23:52:41 UTC

**by** [Rick Wanner](/handler_list.html#rick-wanner) (Version: 2)

[1 comment(s)](/diary/Microsoft%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2Bfor%2BASPNET/9568/#comments)

Microsoft has released a [security advisory for ASP.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2416728.mspx) ([CVE-2010-3332](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3332)).  It looks like there are no known attacks for this vulnerability at this time, and no update has been released.

To quote [the release](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2416728.mspx)...

"Microsoft is investigating a new public report of a vulnerability in ASP.NET. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could view data, such as the View State, which was encrypted by the target server, or read data from files on the target server, such as web.config. This would allow the attacker to tamper with the contents of the data. By sending back the altered contents to an affected server, the attacker could observe the error codes returned by the server. We are not aware of attacks that try to use the reported vulnerabilities or of customer impact at this time."

More details are available at [Scott Guthrie's Blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/18/important-asp-net-security-vulnerability.aspx). As reader Jacob pointed out, Scott also details a configuration change that can be used for a workaround until the update is released.

# Fear, uncertainty and the padding oracle exploit in ASP.NET

19 September 2010

You’ve gotta feel a bit sorry for Scott Guthrie. Microsoft’s developer division VP normally spends his time writing about all the great new work his team is doing and basking in the kudos of loyal followers. But not this weekend. Unfortunately [his latest post](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/18/important-asp-net-security-vulnerability.aspx?ref=troyhunt.com) has been all about repeating the same dire message; ASP.NET has a major security flaw posing a critical vulnerability to millions of websites. Actually that’s putting it nicely; much of the feedback on the web is a little blunter talking about the vulnerability [totally destroying ASP.NET security](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/new-crypto-attack-affects-millions-aspnet-apps-091310?ref=troyhunt.com). Ouch.

Actually, it’s not so much the fact he had to write the post that makes me feel sorry for him, it’s that he has to continually respond to the same questions from (understandably) fearful, worried customers. It’s not surprising, the vulnerability is a little abstract to understand and the potential ramifications are rather scary. Furthermore, the mitigations he has recommended – namely around errors handling – probably seem a little obscure.

This is an issue which is quite possibly going to consume a bit of my time in the coming weeks so I thought I’d start out right now by explaining what the vulnerability is, what remediation is required and most importantly, actually show how they mitigate the problem. It’s this last point that I don’t think Scott quite captured and I suspect that’s why there is so much uncertainty now.

**Sep 25th Update:** I’ve also written about [Why sleep is good for your app’s padding oracle](https://www.troyhunt.com/2010/09/why-sleep-is-good-for-your-apps-padding.html)
**Sep 29th update:** The patch and how to test for it in [Do you trust your hosting provider and have they really installed the padding oracle patch?](https://www.troyhunt.com/2010/09/do-you-trust-your-hosting-provider-and.html)

## The exploit in action

Let’s start out with a bang. Just in case you haven’t already heard about the exploit or seen what it can do, watch this before reading any further. This was demonstrated at the [Ekoparty conference in Argentina](http://ekoparty.org/juliano-rizzo-2010.php?ref=troyhunt.com) a few days ago:

What just happened? In short, there were three simple steps:

1. The [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext?ref=troyhunt.com) appended to a [web resource](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910442/en-us?ref=troyhunt.com) request was retrieved from the HTML source of the page. This is effectively an encrypted version of the resource identifier. It’s the algorithm behind this encryption the exploit sets out to break.
2. The [Padding Oracle Exploit Tool](http://netifera.com/research/?ref=troyhunt.com) (or POET) is given the URL of the site and the ciphertext from step 1. It then sets out to break the algorithm used in the encryption process. This is the heart of what the exploit is all about.
3. The exploited algorithm is then used to create a new, encrypted cookie with super user rights to the DotNetNuke instance in the attack. This cookie is then simply added to the browser granting the attacker all the rights they could desire over the target site.

This particular example goes on to load a malicious payload into the server allowing command line access from the UI but the damage was really done in step 3. In very simple terms, the exploit allows normally secure artefacts generated by the server to be decrypted and forged.

## What’s all this got to do with Oracle?

No, not [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/?ref=troyhunt.com), [oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine?ref=troyhunt.com). More specifically, it’s about the oracle used against [padding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_%28cryptography%29?ref=troyhunt.com) which in cryptography is all about discovering how encrypted versions of plain text strings are padded out to fit neatly in eight bytes. There’s a *fantastic* overview of how this works in [Automated Padding Oracle Attacks with PadBuster](http://www.gdssecurity.com/l/b/2010/09/14/automated-padding-oracle-attacks-with-padbuster/?ref=troyhunt.com) if you want to understand it in depth, I’m just going to distil this to the basics. This info is almost entirely from the post in the previous sentence (as is the first image I’ve borrowed), so all credit to those guys. No guarantees on me getting all of this 100% right but hopefully the gist of it will come through ok.

Imagine every encrypted string has to consume a multiple of eight bytes of data. In order to do this, different amounts of padding are required for different string lengths:

![po_fig1](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/600599po_fig15B275D.png "po_fig1")

One thing you’ll notice is that each padding byte represents the total number of bytes in the padding. For example, FIG has five padding bytes of 0x05. If the encrypted version of FIG contained five bytes of padding that *weren’t* all 0x05, the server would throw an error when it went to decrypt it. In short, the response of the server can disclose if the encrypted value is correctly padded or not. From the link above, this is called a padding oracle because:

> The term oracle refers to a mechanism that can be used to determine whether a test has passed or failed.

Here’s where it gets interesting; if an encrypted string can be passed to the server and its response can tell you whether the padding is valid or not, the request can be manipulated to continually change the bytes in the request and reissue them to the server until a successful response is returned. The bytes this technique manipulates are contained in the [initialisation vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector?ref=troyhunt.com) (IV) which is the eight bytes preceding the encrypted string. Each byte is then used in the decryption algorithm so it’s pivotal to successfully decrypting the string.

If the IV can be manipulated until it resolves the corresponding encrypted byte to the appropriate padding value and the server confirms this by *not* returning an error, the process can be repeated for each byte of the IV until all eight are known. The IV can then be used to *decrypt* the remaining ciphertext. A similar process can be used to *encrypt* a new string.

This exploit isn’t actually new; it was [reported eight years back by the Swiss](http://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2002/23320530/cbc02_e02d.pdf?ref=troyhunt.com). What *is* new is the way it’s been applied against ASP.NET and the fact this particular attack vector has now been published.

## What can you do with this?

An awful lot, unfortunately. The obvious answer is you can decrypt any encrypted strings accessible to the client which means query strings, hidden form fields and cookies. The other problem is that because you can use the above mechanism to encrypt data, you can roll your own cookies. The DotNetNuke exploit in the video works because a perfectly valid cookie indicating the client is a super user could be forged and passed to the server with it being none the wiser. This isn’t a DotNetNuke vulnerability, it could conceivably occur with any ASP.NET site which implements authentication.

But there’s another exploit which Scott [touches on](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/18/important-asp-net-security-vulnerability.aspx?ref=troyhunt.com#7614902) in his post without going into too much detail; the web.config can be downloaded.

> The attack that was shown in the public relies on a feature in ASP.NET that allows files (typically javascript and css) to be downloaded, and which is secured with a key that is sent as part of the request. Unfortunately if you are able to forge a key you can use this feature to download the web.config file of an application (but not files outside of the application).

Although I can’t find any specific references to it, I believe what Scott’s referring to is the ability to use web resources with a forged resource ID which rather than pointing to the usual JavaScript or CSS, instead points to another resource in the app. From the [Working with Web Resources](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910442/en-us?ref=troyhunt.com) page:

> The URL for WebResource.axd looks like the following:
>
> WebResource.axd?d=SbXSD3uTnhYsK4gMD8fL84\_mHPC5jJ7lfdnr1\_WtsftZiUOZ6IXYG8QCXW86UizF0&t=632768953157700078
>
> The format of this URL is WebResource.axd?d=encrypted identifier&t=time stamp value. The "d" stands for the requested Web Resource. The "t" is the timestamp for the requested assembly, which can help in determining if there have been any changes to the resource.

You can see how this is an appended query string value and as the video earlier showed, these requests simply return the resource in its entirety.

## What’s vulnerable?

Basically any ASP.NET based products including obviously ASP.NET websites and DotNetNuke but also SharePoint and ASP.NET MVC. Of course this also extends to products like [Umbraco](http://umbraco.org/?ref=troyhunt.com) that are offerings on top of the framework.

## Mitigation

Scott makes two recommendations from which a lot of confusion then flows:

1. Enable custom errors with response rewriting and a single error page for all error types.
2. Add a random sleep delay to the error page.

On the surface of it, these seem like rather odd ways of addressing a cryptography vulnerability, but there’s method in the madness. Both these recommendations are designed to obfuscate the fact a server error has occurred. If the attacker is not being told when their manipulated IV is causing an error versus when it’s passing through successfully, the ability to exploit the vulnerability is severely hobbled.

## Managing server errors

Let’s look at how using a single custom errors page helps the situation. I’ve created a standard web app with all the usual, out of the box settings and configured an IIS website against it on port 85. By default, the following JavaScript is embedded in the page (we don’t have to use a web resource file, the same logic applies to any other resource executing on the server):

```
<script src="/WebResource.axd?d=8KdqlbnKlEkJNojRMjxtSxbXkp67u-rzhy_VoqsYA901&amp;t=634200755509128189" type="text/javascript"></script>

```

Now, if I manipulate the resource ID (the “d” query string value) and reissue the request and monitor the response with Fiddler, here’s what I see:

![image](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/606605image5B55D.png "image")

By returning a 500 response code, IIS has just confirmed the server has thrown an error. Now let’s make the first change Scott recommended, namely creating a dedicated error page with response writing as the redirect mode and adding it as the default redirect in the custom errors node:

![image](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/604603image5B85D.png "image")

Now we’re getting a 200 response which for all intents and purposes means it was a successful request, at least as far as the headers go. You’ll also see the requested URL is the web resource page and not the error page. This is actually one important point that wasn’t fully explained in Scott’s post; it’s important the redirect mode is set to “ResponseRewrite”. If not, the default “ResponseRedirect” value will be applied and here’s what will happen:

![image](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/602601image5B115D.png "image")

Now we’re getting an [HTTP 302 redirect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302?ref=troyhunt.com) which then asks the browser to make a separate request for “Error.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/WebResource.axd”. This pretty much gives the game away and confirms that an error has been thrown as a result of the request. By rewriting the request the error page is returned in the initial response which caused the server error rather than in a subsequent response.

Some people have asked if just turning custom errors on by specifying <customErrors mode="On" /> is sufficient. Unfortunately, it’s not and here’s why:

![image](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/598597image5B145D.png "image")

Obviously this once again exposes the HTTP 500 response code so although it has the advantage of not exposing the *specific* internal error, it still indicates the request has failed.

The other things Scott asks you to configure in the custom errors (or rather *not* configure), is different error pages for different error codes. A lot of people have asked what this means for their custom [404 page not found](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404?ref=troyhunt.com) error pages, often used to provide a *functional* value to the user (ie. an external link points to a now defunct page). Here’s [his message](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/18/important-asp-net-security-vulnerability.aspx?ref=troyhunt.com#7614980), repeated many, many times:

> One of the ways this attack works is that looks for differentiation between 404s and 500 errors. It can use this differentiation to try out potential keys (typically over tens of thousands of requests). Always returning the same HTTP code and sending them to the same place is one way to help block it.

I haven’t seen the attack Scott talks about in practice but what’s obvious is that it’s looking for particular resources within the application. Not returning 404 page not found obfuscates the fact the resource doesn’t actually exist from automated attacks. Yes, it has a usability impact and possibly other issues beyond that (search engine crawlers, perhaps?), but he’s consistently emphatic about avoiding this particular response code so there’s obviously something in it.

**Sep 20th update:**the 404 risk is that if the padding oracle exploit is attempted against the resource ID in the WebResource.axd file and the manipulated IV is correct in the context of the ciphertext but the resource doesn’t exist (hence the 404), the same response is returned as if the IV was invalid. This makes the gradual incrementing of each IV byte and using the response as a success measure pointless as the response is always the same whether the byte is valid or not. The only way a 500 server error *wouldn’t* be returned using Scott’s recommendations is if the resource ID is correct and a valid resource is found.

## Having a little sleep

The other recommendation Scott makes is to add a small, random sleep to the error page. Essentially what he’s suggesting is obfuscation of the error page load time in order to avoid establishing a pattern which could be used to identify when an error response is being returned. This is often referred to as a “remote timing” attack.

I know what you’re thinking; does adding a few milliseconds here or there really improve the security of my app? Quite a lot has been written on this subject, [Exploiting remote timing attacks](http://rdist.root.org/2010/07/19/exploiting-remote-timing-attacks/?ref=troyhunt.com) is but one example of many resources which talks about the practice. If you really want endorsement of why Scott’s suggestion has some merit, here’s an [interesting tweet](https://twitter.com/?ref=troyhunt.com#!/thaidn/status/24832350146) from one of the duo who produced the video:

![image](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/588587image5B175D.png "image")

And if there’s no big timing difference? I’m sure there’s still a way but its one more layer of defence. And it’s free.

## Summary

I would have liked to have gone into this vulnerability a lot deeper. I’ve not successfully run the exploit and have instead spent the day reading and absorbing information. I’ve seen enough today to be convinced this exploit poses a serious risk and that alone is worth writing about, particularly in terms of shedding some light on the rationale behind The Gu’s recommendations.

This is one of those “first thing Monday morning” type of vulnerabilities. As the word has spread over the last couple of days and the impact has begun to sink in, there’s going to be a lot of devs arriving at the office tomorrow morning with some work to do. If you’re responsible for any ASP.NET website and you’re *not* making some pretty speedy changes tomorrow morning, your site may just be one of the first sites compromised by this exploit.

Scott makes multiple mentions of a patch coming from Microsoft but is very non-committal on exactly when we’ll see it. We also don’t know what form the patch will take; will it be patch to the framework requiring a server install and all the governance (and lead time) that goes along with it? Or will it mean re-deployment of apps? One thing’s for sure, it *will* require some legwork and getting started on the mitigation early by following his guidance is the only smart thing to do at this stage.

We live in interesting times.

# Important: ASP.NET Security Vulnerability

Saturday, September 18, 2010
[.NET](/scottgu/Tags/.NET)
[ASP.NET](/scottgu/Tags/ASP.NET)
[Community News](/scottgu/Tags/Community%20News)
[Security](/scottgu/Tags/Security)

A few hours ago we released a [Microsoft Security Advisory](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2416728.mspx) about a security vulnerability in ASP.NET.  This vulnerability exists in all versions of ASP.NET.

This vulnerability was publically disclosed late Friday at a security conference.  We recommend that all customers immediately apply a workaround (described below) to prevent attackers from using this vulnerability against your ASP.NET applications.

> **Important Update:** You can now download the official security patch update [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/09/30/asp-net-security-fix-now-on-windows-update.aspx).  Please install it ASAP on your servers – it is the only way to protect against the vulnerability.  You should no longer rely on the below workaround and instead install the official security patch update immediately to protect yourself.

### What does the vulnerability enable?

An attacker using this vulnerability can request and download files within an ASP.NET Application like the web.config file (which often contains sensitive data).

At attacker exploiting this vulnerability can also decrypt data sent to the client in an encrypted state (like ViewState data within a page).

### How the Vulnerability Works

To understand how this vulnerability works, you need to know about cryptographic oracles. An oracle in the context of cryptography is a system which provides hints as you ask it questions. In this case, there is a vulnerability in ASP.NET which acts as a padding oracle. This allows an attacker to send cipher text to the web server and learn if it was decrypted properly by examining which error code was returned by the web server.  By making many such requests (and watching what errors are returned) the attacker can learn enough to successfully decrypt the rest of the cipher text.

### How to Workaround The Vulnerability

A workaround you can use to prevent this vulnerability is to enable the <customErrors> feature of ASP.NET, and explicitly configure your applications to always return the same error page - regardless of the error encountered on the server. By mapping all error pages to a single error page, you prevent a hacker from distinguishing between the different types of errors that occur on a server.

**Important**: It is not enough to simply turn on CustomErrors or have it set to RemoteOnly. You also need to make sure that all errors are configured to return the same error page.  This requires you to explicitly set the “defaultRedirect” attribute on the <customErrors> section and ensure that no per-status codes are set.

### Enabling the Workaround on ASP.NET V1.0 to V3.5

If you are using ASP.NET 1.0, ASP.NET 1.1, ASP.NET 2.0, or ASP.NET 3.5 then you should follow the below steps to enable <customErrors> and map all errors to a single error page:

1) Edit your ASP.NET Application’s root Web.Config file.  If the file doesn’t exist, then create one in the root directory of the application.

2) Create or modify the <customErrors> section of the web.config file to have the below settings:

> ```
> <configuration>
>
>    <system.web>
>
>       <customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="~/error.html" />
>
>    </system.web>
>
> </configuration>
> ```

3) You can then add an error.html file to your application that contains an appropriate error page of your choosing (containing whatever content you like).  This file will be displayed anytime an error occurs within the web application.

**Notes:** The important things to note above is that customErrors is set to “on”, and that all errors are handled by the defaultRedirect error page.  There are not any per-status code error pages defined – which means that there are no <error> sub-elements within the <customErrors> section.  This avoids an attacker being able to differentiate why an error occurred on the server, and prevents information disclosure.

### Enabling the Workaround on ASP.NET V3.5 SP1 and ASP.NET 4.0

If you are using ASP.NET 3.5 SP1 or ASP.NET 4.0 then you should follow the below steps to enable <customErrors> and map all errors to a single error page:

1) Edit your ASP.NET Application’s root Web.Config file.  If the file doesn’t exist, then create one in the root directory of the application.

2) Create or modify the <customErrors> section of the web.config file to have the below settings.  Note the use of redirectMode=”ResponseRewrite” with .NET 3.5 SP1 and .NET 4.0:

> ```
> <configuration>
>
>    <system.web>
>
>      <customErrors mode="On" redirectMode="ResponseRewrite" defaultRedirect="~/error.aspx" />
>
>    </system.web>
>
> </configuration>
> ```

3) You can then add an Error.aspx to your application that contains an appropriate error page of your choosing (containing whatever content you like).  This file will be displayed anytime an error occurs within the web application.

4) We recommend adding the below code to the Page\_Load() server event handler within the Error.aspx file to add a random, small sleep delay. This will help to further obfuscate errors.

VB Version

Below is a VB version of an Error.aspx file that you can use, and which has a random, small sleep delay in it.  You do not need to compile this into an application – you can optionally just save this Error.aspx file into the application directory on your web-server:

> ```
> <%@ Page Language="VB" AutoEventWireup="true" %>
> <%@ Import Namespace="System.Security.Cryptography" %>
> <%@ Import Namespace="System.Threading" %>
>
> <script runat="server">
>     Sub Page_Load()
>         Dim delay As Byte() = New Byte(0) {}
>         Dim prng As RandomNumberGenerator = New RNGCryptoServiceProvider()
>
>         prng.GetBytes(delay)
>         Thread.Sleep(CType(delay(0), Integer))
>
>         Dim disposable As IDisposable = TryCast(prng, IDisposable)
>         If Not disposable Is Nothing Then
>             disposable.Dispose()
>         End If
>     End Sub
> </script>
>
> <html>
> <head runat="server">
>     <title>Error</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <div>
>         Sorry - an error occured
>     </div>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```

C# Version

Below is a C# version of an Error.aspx file that you can use, and which has a random, small sleep delay in it.  You do not need to compile this into an application – you can optionally just save it into the application directory on your web-server:

> ```
> <%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" %>
> <%@ Import Namespace="System.Security.Cryptography" %>
> <%@ Import Namespace="System.Threading" %>
>
> <script runat="server">
>    void Page_Load() {
>       byte[] delay = new byte[1];
>       RandomNumberGenerator prng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
>
>       prng.GetBytes(delay);
>       Thread.Sleep((int)delay[0]);
>
>       IDisposable disposable = prng as IDisposable;
>       if (disposable != null) { disposable.Dispose(); }
>     }
> </script>
>
> <html>
> <head runat="server">
>     <title>Error</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <div>
>         An error occurred while processing your request.
>     </div>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```

### How to Verify if the <customErrors> section is correct

Once you have applied the above configuration, you can test to make sure the <customErrors> section is correctly configured by requesting a URL like this from your site: <http://mysite.com/pagethatdoesnotexist.aspx>

If you see the custom error page appear (because the file you requested doesn’t exist) then your configuration should be setup correctly.  If you see a standard ASP.NET error then it is likely that you missed one of the steps above.  To see more information about what might be the cause of the problem, you can try setting <customErrors mode=”remoteOnly”/> – which will enable you to see the error message if you are connecting to the site from a local browser.

### Install and Enable IIS URLScan with a Custom Rule

If you do not already have the [IIS URLScan module](http://www.iis.net/download/UrlScan) installed on your IIS web server, please download and install it:

* [x86 Version](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9655677)
* [x64 Version](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9655678)

It takes less than a minute to install on your server.

**Add an Addition URL Scan Rule**

Once URLScan is installed, please open and modify the UrlScan.ini file in this location:

* %windir%\system32\inetsrv\urlscan\UrlScan.ini

Near the bottom of the UrlScan.ini file you’ll find a [DenyQueryStringSequences] section.  Add an additional “aspxerrorpath=” entry immediately below it and then save the file:

> ```
> [DenyQueryStringSequences]
> aspxerrorpath=
> ```

The above entry disallows URLs that have an “*aspxerrorpath=”* querystring attribute from making their way to ASP.NET applications, and will instead cause the web-server to return an HTTP error.  Adding this rule prevents attackers from distinguishing between the different types of errors occurring on a server – which helps block attacks using this vulnerability.

After saving this change, run “iisreset” from a command prompt (elevated as admin) for the above changes to take effect.  To verify the change has been made, try accessing a URL on your site/application that has a querystring with an aspxerrorpath and verify that an HTTP error is sent back from IIS.

### How to Find Vulnerable ASP.NET Applications on Your Web Server

We have [published a .vbs script](http://www.asp.net/media/782788/detectcustomerrorsdisabledv30.zip) that you can save and run on your web-server to determine if there are ASP.NET applications installed on it that either have <customErrors> turned off, or which differentiate error messages depending on status codes.

You can download the .vbs script [here](http://www.asp.net/media/782788/detectcustomerrorsdisabledv30.zip).  Simply copy/paste the script into a text file called “DetectCustomErrors.vbs” and save it to disk.  Then launch a command window that is elevated as admin and run “cscript DetectCustomErrors.vbs” to run it against your local web-server.  It will enumerate all of the applications within your web server and verify that the correct <customErrors> configuration has been specified.

[![command[1]](http://www.scottgu.com/blogposts/command.png "command[1]")](http://www.scottgu.com/blogposts/command.png)

It will flag any application where it finds that an application’s web.config file doesn’t have the <customErrors> section (in which case you need to add it), or doesn’t have it set correctly to workaround this attack (in which case you need to update it).  It will print “ok” for each application web.config file it finds that is fine.  This should hopefully make it easier to locate issues.

Note: We have developed this detection script over the last few hours, and will be refining it further in the future.  I will post an update in this section each time we make a change to it.

If you start messing with HTTP status codes in IIS as a way to try and "patch" this vulnerability, you WILL cause yourself an outage on your .NET applications, including SharePoint. Please be warned.

In reality this "workaround" is little more than trying to use a mousetrap in a large room - the mouse can always go straight past the trap instead, but hey, atleast Microsoft can claim that they responded. The problem is that not only does this "workaround" not patch it up completely, the confusion that it's creating could cause trigger happy and hyper-sensitive IT admins to attempt drastic measures to seal off an apparently huge risk.

And by "this" I refer to "using the exact same error page, and exact same status codes" consider these two scenarios: 1. an e-commerce site. A url of a missing product should render a 404, probably with a custom message suggesting the user to keep browsing for other things 2. a site serving an API, where the clients depends on exact error messages Is there any better workaround for the exploit?

For .NET 3.5 and below it will do a client-side redirect to whatever URL you send it. .NET 3.5 SP1 added support so that you can also just send back HTML (and not change the URL) which a lot of people prefer since if end-users hit refresh again it will not simply reload the error page.

There are lots of different platform matrixes and localization languages to build/test/verify which is why producing a patch with high confidence enough to deploy automatically across millions of machines takes a bit of time to get right. In the meantime we published the above workaround to prevent attacks using the attack approach discussed publicly yesterday.

  > >>>>>>>>>I'm still not clear how this affects ASP.NET MVC in particular. With MVC, we have the option (via routing) to send any request not matching a route to a 404 page. Additionally, we have the option to catch any execution exception via the [HandleError] attribute and show a 500 page. In both cases, the ASP.NET custom error pages are not used. So, an MVC app will still show different output for a 404 or 500, irrespective of the ASP.NET web.config customErrors configuration. Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.

If that is in fact the root of the problem, would it close the loop to just remove it for our sites? That would be preferred over sending back incorrect status codes, which can screw up search engine rankings and confuse end users.

You wrote to many details, and this is also not very good, it was better to find how to fix it ASAP and release appropriate update without any comments (I think that not many companies will use your fix in the near future, maybe I'm wrong, sorry in this case)...

We tend to focus on emitting our own HTML and JS - we use Repeaters and ListViews and handwritten JS and the like instead. If that is in fact the root of the problem, would it close the loop to just remove it for our sites? That would be preferred over sending back incorrect status codes, which can screw up search engine rankings and confuse end users.

However, I work very hard to make sure all my ASP.Net sites are as secure as possible and I feel rather let down of this big one that is outside of my control. After reading nearly every comment on this site and watching the attack video, I am really confused on how it actually works - I have read your "it can tell the difference between 400 and 500" comment numerous times, but I still do not really understand. I appreciate the need for secrecy before a patch is released, but, will it be possible to release further details when it is all dealt with as to more of the background of this attack? To be honest, without something like this, I do not see my faith of ASP.Net returning any time soon.

I use the Application\_Error method of the Global.ASAX page to redirect all errors to a generic error page tailored to the individual application. This method also sends me an e-mail message with all the error details so that I can know about the error and work on preventing it in the future.

  >
  >
  > - Is it possible to use external config files (via and/or ) located in a directory with access credentials that are more secure than that of the anonymous IIS user (without anonymous users being prompted for login when attempting to access a page on the site)? The thought being that if it's possible, it may provide an increased level of security that would help reduce exposure to the vulnerability.

  >
  >
  > - If the above is not possible, would it not make more sense for one to take a half day to write a simple custom class/object that accesses a custom configuration scheme/file located in a directory outside of any IIS folders accessible by anonymous users?

* > @Evan: You asked "Why not just flip the encryption method from AES to 3DES"... because the oracle padding attack exploits a weakness in the PKCS7 (or PKCS5) padding scheme; it is not a weakness in any particular cipher. The proper fix for this is to ensure message authenticity by adding a "message authentication code" (MAC) over the IV and ciphertext and to check that the MAC is valid prior to trying to decrypt.

* > For the folks who have asked about the web.config file being downloaded, this is possible ONLY if the first padding oracle attack has been successful (i.e., the attacker finds out what the decryption key is). The subsequent download capability is not limited to web.config, but to all files in your web directory, including assemblies in the bin directory. The downloads would not easily be discernible in the IIS logs because it hides under an ASP.NET feature introduced in 3.5.

The only difference would be that the errorpage.aspx would take a string query parameter that is set based on the value of the error code.

I have followed your guidance and have been at it for a few hours now without any luck. The site I'm working on now uses Forms authentication and if I login then try to get to a page that is on the root of the site that does not exist I get sent to the generic error page just fine. The trouble comes when I test for an invalid url to a resource that is off the root of the site like a document. It's here that I see the standard IIS7 404 message.

I don't have any official releases out there yet because I could use some help testing it and/or coding it. I haven't seen the exploit tools so I haven't been able to verify it's effectiveness yet. Right now, it's got 2 main features relating to the padding oracle expoit:

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on February 22, 2011?**

Microsoft revised this security bulletin to announce a detection change to offer the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (KB2416472) update packages to systems running Windows 7 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 1, Windows 7 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2008 R2 for Itanium-based Systems Service Pack 1. This detection change only applies to customers who install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 after installing Windows 7 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 1, Windows 7 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1, or Windows Server 2008 R2 for Itanium-based Systems Service Pack 1. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.

**Why was this bulletin revised on December 14, 2010?**

Microsoft revised this security bulletin to announce that new update packages are available for Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (KB2416472). These new packages correct an issue in the setup that could interfere with the successful installation of other updates. For customers who may have an installation of another product or update that may have been affected by this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2473228](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2473228) for additional information. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.

**I have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed; this version is not listed among the affected software in this bulletin. Do I need to install an update?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 and the .NET Framework 3.5 feature layers. The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installer chains in the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup, so installing the former also installs the latter. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 installed. Do I need to install any additional updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 and the .NET Framework 3.5 feature layers. The .NET Framework 3.5 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 1 setup. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.5 installed also need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 in addition to the updates for .NET Framework 3.5.

To help determine if there are any additional versions of the .NET Framework installed on your system, see the FAQ entry, "How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed," later in this section.

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed. Do I need to install any additional updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 and the .NET Framework 3.5 feature layers. The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 setup. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed also need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

To help determine if there are any additional versions of the .NET Framework installed on your system, see the FAQ entry, "How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed," later in this section.

## ASP.NET Padding Oracle Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3332

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in ASP.NET due to improper error handling during encryption padding verification. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data, such as the view state, which was encrypted by the server. This vulnerability can also be used for data tampering, which, if successfully exploited, could be used to decrypt and tamper with the data encrypted by the server. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system. In Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and above, this vulnerability can also be used by an attacker to retrieve the contents of any file within the ASP.NET application, including web.config.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-3332](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3332).

#### Mitigating Factors for ASP.NET Padding Oracle Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3332

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Microsoft .NET Framework versions prior to Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 are not affected by the file content disclosure portion of this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for ASP.NET Padding Oracle Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3332

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Enable a UrlScan or Request Filtering rule, enable ASP.NET custom errors, and map all error codes to the same error page**

  Enabling the customErrors feature of ASP.NET and explicitly configuring applications to always return the same error page, regardless of the error encountered on the server, can make it more difficult for an attacker using the current exploit to distinguish between the different types of errors that occur on a server.

  On systems using the .NET Framework version 3.5 Service Pack 1 and above, the workaround provides further protection by also helping to protect against the timing attack portion of the current exploit. The workaround uses the redirectMode="ResponseRewrite" option in the customErrors feature, and introduces a random delay in the error page. These approaches work together to make it more difficult for an attacker to deduce the type of error that occurred on the server by measuring the time it took to receive the error.

  Additionally, this workaround requires blocking requests that specify the application error path on the querystring. This can be done using URLScan, a free tool for Internet Information Services (IIS) that can selectively block requests based on rules defined by the administrator. If your system is running Internet Information Services (IIS) on Windows Vista Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2, you can alternatively use the Request Filtering feature.

  **Block requests that modify ASP.Net application error path on the request querystring**

  **Using UrlScan:**

  1. Download and install [UrlScan 3.1](https://www.iis.net/download/urlscan). For further instructions on configuring and using UrlScan, see [UrlScan 3 Reference](https://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/938/urlscan-3-reference/).
  2. Modify UrlScan.ini (found in **%windir%\system32\inetsrv\urlscan**). Insert the following line under the **[DenyQueryStringSequences]** section of the Urlscan.ini file:

  `aspxerrorpath=`

  After you do so, the **[DenyQueryStringSequences]** section should look similar to this (additional lines in the section are okay and do not affect the workaround):

  ```
  [DenyQueryStringSequences]
  aspxerrorpath=

  ```
  3. Run **iisreset** from a command prompt while logged in as an administrator.

  **Using IIS request filtering:**

  These instructions are an alternative for the UrlScan instructions above for systems running IIS on Windows Vista Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2.

  1. Install the Request Filtering feature in IIS through either Add/Remove Programs or Role Manger by selecting the feature under **Internet Information Services, World Wide Web Services, Security**.
  2. Launch **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.**
  3. Select the server node in the left pane.
  4. Double-click **Request Filtering**.
  5. Select the **Query Strings** tab and click **Deny Query String â¦** in the **Actions** pane.
  6. Enter **aspxerrorpath=** in the dialog box and select **OK.**

  Alternatively, you can also use the following appcmd command to set this request querystring:

  `appcmd set config /section:requestfiltering /+denyQueryStringSequences.[sequence='aspxerrorpath=']`

  For more information on using appcmd to configure IIS, see [Getting Started with AppCmd.exe](https://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/114/getting-started-with-appcmdexe).

  **Configure ASP.Net applications to use uniform custom errors**

  In the root folder of each ASP.NET web application, determine if you already have a web.config file in this folder. You must have rights to create a file in the target directory to implement this workaround.

  If the ASP.NET application does not have a web.config file:

  **On .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier**

  1. Create a text file named **web.config** in the root folder of the ASP.NET application, and insert the following contents:
  ```
  <configuration>

  ```

```
```
2. Create a text file named **error.html** containing a generic error message and save it in the root folder of the ASP.NET application.

3. Alternatively, you can rename error.html in the **web.config** file to point to an existing error page, but that page must display generic content, not context-specific content.

**On .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and later**

1. Create a text file named **web.config** in the root folder of the ASP.NET application, and insert the following contents:

```
<configuration>

```
```
```
2. If you are comfortable using C\#, we recommend using the following **ErrorPage.aspx** file:

```
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" %>
<%@ Import Namespace="System.Security.Cryptography" %>
<%@ Import Namespace="System.Threading" %>
```
```
<script runat="server">
void Page_Load() {
byte[] delay = new byte[1];
RandomNumberGenerator prng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();

prng.GetBytes(delay);
Thread.Sleep((int)delay[0]);

IDisposable disposable = prng as IDisposable;
if (disposable != null) { disposable.Dispose(); }
}
</script>
```

Dim delay As Byte() = New Byte(0) {}
Dim prng As RandomNumberGenerator = New RNGCryptoServiceProvider()

prng.GetBytes(delay)
Thread.Sleep(CType(delay(0), Integer))

```
<html xmlns="https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

```
```
```
If the ASP.NET application already has a **web.config** file:

**On .NET Framework 3.5 RTM and earlier**

1. Insert the bracketed text in the sample below into your existing **web.config** file:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>

```
```
[<location allowoverride="false">

```

<system.web>
</system.web>
]

```
<system.web>
...
</system.web>

```

<system.codedom>
...
</system.codedom>
```

```
2. Create a text file named **error.html** containing a generic error message and save it in the root folder of the ASP.NET application.

3. Alternatively, you can rename error.html in the **web.config** file to point to an existing error page, but that page must display generic content, not context-specific content.

**On .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and later**

1. Insert the bracketed text in the sample below into your existing **web.config** file:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>

```
```
[<location allowoverride="false">

**Impact of Workaround:** If an error occurs during a Web transaction, the Web clients will see the same generic error message on the server, regardless of what error actually occurs. Additionally, any requests for Web pages which contain the string **aspxerrropath=** in the querystring portion of the URL will be blocked, and an HTTP error message returned to the client.

#### FAQ for ASP.NET Padding Oracle Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3332

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to read data, such as the view state, which was encrypted by the server. This vulnerability can also be used for data tampering, which, if successfully exploited, could be used to decrypt and tamper with the data encrypted by the server. In Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and above, this vulnerability can also be used by an attacker to retrieve the contents of any file within the ASP.NET application, including web.config. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The ASP.NET use of encryption padding provides information in error responses that can be used by an attacker to read and tamper with the encrypted data.

**What is ASP.NET?**

ASP.NET is a collection of technologies within the Microsoft .NET Framework that enable developers to build Web applications and XML Web Services.

Unlike traditional Web pages, which use a combination of static HTML and scripting, ASP.NET uses compiled, event-driven pages. Because ASP.NET is a Web-based application environment, requiring an underlying Web server to provide basic HTTP functionality, ASP.NET runs on top of Internet Information Services (IIS). For more information, see [The Official Microsoft ASP.NET Site](https://www.asp.net/).

**What is ASP.NET View State?**

Microsoft ASP.NET View State is the technique used by an ASP.NET Web page to persist changes to the state of a Web Form across postbacks. The View State of a page is, by default, placed in a hidden form field named **\_\_VIEWSTATE**. For more information on ASP.NET View State, see MSDN article, [Understanding ASP.NET View State](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms972976.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to read data, such as the view state, which was encrypted by the server. The attacker may then be able to read the contents of any file within the web site directory or subdirectories, such as web.config. The web.config file often stores sensitive information. The consequences of the disclosure of that information depend on the nature of the information itself.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could also read data from files on the target server which exist in the website directory or subdirectories.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would send cipher text via a Web request to an affected server to determine whether the text was decrypted properly by examining the error code returned by the website. An attacker who made enough of these requests could learn enough information to read or tamper with the encrypted data.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Web servers with ASP.NET installed are at risk from this vulnerability.

**Am I vulnerable if I have a custom logging module that redirects to an error page instead of using the workaround listed below?**

If the responses that are sent out from your custom logging module do not let the client distinguish between error responses either through its content or time that it takes to serve out, then such a module is an adequate replacement for the customErrors workaround. These responses include both the entire HTTP response and the HTTP error code. If any of the above is not true at all times, then this is not sufficient.

**Can I create a custom 404 page and a default redirect for all other errors to help protect against this issue?**

No. An attacker could still draw a distinction between a 404 error and other errors. Homogenizing errors is a crucial component to help protect against this attack.

**Should I be concerned about this vulnerability if I don't store any sensitive information in my View State?**

Yes. If you are storing sensitive information in any file in the web application, this vulnerability could be used to disclose the contents of that file to an attacker.

**What are best practices to secure my data within the web.config file?**

It is best practice to encrypt sensitive configuration data within web.config files. For detailed information on encrypting configuration sections, see MSDN article, [Encrypting and Decrypting Configuration Sections](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/zhhddkxy%28vs.80%29.aspx).

**Does this issue affect both ASP.NET Web Form and ASP.NET MVC Web applications?**

Yes. The publicly disclosed exploit can be used against all types of ASP.NET applications, including both Web Forms and MVC. For additional information on ASP.NET MVC, see MSDN article, [ASP.NET MVC Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd381412.aspx).

**Are other applications built on the ASP.NET platform, such as SharePoint and Exchange, affected by this issue?**

All applications that rely on the ASP.NET platform are affected by this issue. Administrators of these applications should follow the recommendations outlined in this advisory.

**Will switching to Triple DES encryption instead of AES encryption help protect my ASP.NET application?**

No. The cryptographic vulnerability being presented involves revealing cryptographic padding errors to a client for algorithms that use PKCS #7 padding. Since Triple DES shares this padding mode with AES, switching to Triple DES will not protect against this vulnerability.

**What is Triple DES (3DES)?**

Triple DES (3DES) is an implementation of Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption that employs three iterations of cryptographic operations on each segment of data. Each iteration uses a 56-bit key for encryption, which yields 168-bit encryption for the data. Although 3DES is slower than DES because of the additional cryptographic calculations, its protection is far stronger than DES.

**What is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)?**

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a form of encryption that was adopted by the United States government in 2001. AES provides more secure encryption than its predecessor, Data Encryption Standard (DES).

**What is PKCS #7 padding?**

The Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #7 is a general syntax for data to which cryptography may be applied, such as digital signatures and encryption. It also provides a syntax for disseminating certificates or certificate revocation lists and other message attributes, such as time stamps, to the message. The PKCS #7 padding string consists of a sequence of bytes, each of which is equal to the total number of padding bytes added.

**Does this issue affect Oracle database products?**

No. The issue is not related to any database products. The word "oracle" in this case refers to a cryptographic term.

**What does the update do?**

The update addressed the vulnerability by signing all data that is encrypted by ASP.NET.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2010-3332](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3332).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.

**Note for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 (KB2418241)** When you install this security update, the installer checks whether the product or component being updated has previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the LDR (or QFE) version of the files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the GDR version of the files to your system. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960043](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960043).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Note for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 (KB2418241)** When you install this security update, the installer checks whether the product or component being updated has previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the LDR (or QFE) version of the files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the GDR version of the files to your system. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960043](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960043).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
