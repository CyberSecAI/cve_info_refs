# TYPO3-SA-2010-020: Multiple vulnerabilities in TYPO3 Core

Categories:
[TYPO3 CMS](/help/security-advisories/typo3-cms "TYPO3 CMS")

Created by Helmut Hummel

It has been discovered that TYPO3 Core is vulnerable to Remote File Disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Privilege Escalation and Denial of Service.

**Component Type:** TYPO3 Core

**Affected Versions:** 4.2.14 and below, 4.3.6 and below, 4.4.3 and below

**Vulnerability Types:** Remote File Disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Privilege Escalation, Denial of Service

**Overall Severity:** Critical

**Release Date:** October 06, 2010

## Vulnerable subcomponent #1: Access tracking mechanism

**Vulnerability Type:** Remote File Disclosure

**Severity:** Critical

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en) ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/))

**Problem Description:** A Remote File Disclosure vulnerability in the jumpUrl mechanism, used to track access on web pages and provided files, allows a remote attacker to read arbitrary files on a host. Because of a non-typesafe comparison between the submitted and the calculated hash, it is possible to spoof a hash value to bypass the access control.

There's no authentication required to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability allows to read any file, the web server user account has access to.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.2.15, 4.3.7 or 4.4.4 that fix the problem described.

It is possible to mitigate this vulnerability for unsupported TYPO3 branches by choosing one of the options below. We however highly recommend to upgrade your TYPO3 installation at least to the lowest supported branch.

1. Use this [shell script](/fileadmin/t3o_teams/security-team/bug15898/fix_15898.sh) (md5 sum: 2af9fb67885b256e27e54d3f50620597, documentation in file) to run accross your webservers in order to replace the affected lines, or
2. Edit the affected file class.tslib\_fe.php following the instructions below.

In TYPO3 versions equal or greater than 4.0, the affected file is located in typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/class.tslib\_fe.php.

In TYPO3 versions lower than 4.0, the affected file is located in tslib/class.tslib\_fe.php and possibly symlinked to the aforementioned location, also in typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/class.tslib\_fe.php

In the file, search for the line:
 ------------------------
 if ($juHash == $calcJuHash) {
 ------------------------

and replace it with:
 ------------------------
 if ($juHash === $calcJuHash) {
 ------------------------
 (Replace the two equal siqns with three)

**Credits:** Credits go to Gregor Kopf for finding and reporting the issue and Security Team Members Helmut Hummel and Marcus Krause for providing patches.

## Vulnerable subcomponent #2: Backend

**Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en) ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/))

**Problem Description:** Failing to sanitize user input, the TYPO3 backend is susceptible to XSS attacks in several places. A valid backend login is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.2.15, 4.3.7 or 4.4.4 that fix the problem described.

**Credits:** Credits go to Daniel Sloof, Core Team Member Susanne Moog, Security Team member Helmut Hummel who discovered and reported the issues.

**Vulnerability Type:** Remote File Disclosure

**Severity:** Low

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en) ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/))

**Problem Description:** Failing to properly validate user input, the Extension Manager is susceptible to Remote File Disclosure. By forging a special request parameter it is possible to view (and edit under special conditions) the contents of every file the webserver has access to. A valid admin user login is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.2.15, 4.3.7 or 4.4.4 that fix the problem described.

**Credits:** Credits go to Jeremy Lebourdais who discovered and reported the issue and Security Team Member Marcus Krause for creating patches.

**Vulnerability Type:** Privilege Escalation

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en) ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/))

**Problem Description:** Failing to properly validate user input, the sys\_action task "be\_user\_creation" is susceptible to Privilege Escalation. By forging a POST request an editor with the rights to create users in the taskcenter, can create users which are a member of arbitrary usergroups and by that probably leverage her privileges.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.2.15, 4.3.7 that fix the problem described. TYPO3 versions 4.4.0 and above are not affected.

**Credits:** Credits go to former Security Team member Henning Pingel who discovered and reported the issue.

## Vulnerable subcomponent #3: Validation/ Filtering API

**Vulnerability Type:** Denial of Service

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en) ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/))

**Problem Description:** Because of a [PHP crash](http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52929) in the filter\_var() function when passing large strings to it, TYPO3 is susceptible to a Denial of Service attack in every place the API function t3lib\_div::validEmail() is used.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.2.15, 4.3.7 or 4.4.4 that fix the problem described.

**Credits:** Credits go to Bjoern Pedersen who discovered and reported the issue and Security Team Member Marcus Krause for creating patches.

**Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting

**Severity:** Low

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en) ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/))

**Problem Description:** The normalisation feature of the RemoveXSS function was incomplete, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Solution:** Update to the TYPO3 versions 4.2.15, 4.3.7 or 4.4.4 that fix the problem described.

**Credits:** Credits go to Franz G. Jahn who discovered and reported the issue and provided an initial patch to mitigate the vulnerability.

**General Advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Cookbook](http://typo3.org/fileadmin/security-team/typo3_security_cookbook_v-0.5.pdf). Please subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [NibbleSecurity](http://blog.nibblesec.org/)

"I've forgotten your password, could you please remind me?"

### [TYPO3-SA-2010-020, TYPO3-SA-2010-022 explained](http://blog.nibblesec.org/2010/12/typo3-sa-2010-020-typo3-sa-2010-022.html)

On 16th December, TYP03 released a new security update ([TYPO3-SA-2010-022](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2010-022/)) for their content management system. Apparently, this web-based framework is widely used in [many important websites](http://blogue.infoglobe.ca/2008/10/22/51-typo3-sites-which-you-may-not-have-known-were-typo3-based/).
Within this update, TYPO3 team fixed a vulnerability that I've discovered a few weeks ago. In detail, this discovery pertains to a previous vulnerability fixed in [TYPO3-SA-2010-020](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2010-020/) and discovered by Gregor Kopf.

TYP03 decided to follow a policy of least disclosure. Although it's an Open Source project, no technical details are available in the wild besides these ([1](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2010-020/),[2](http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=15898)). As I strongly believe that this practice does not improve the overall security (as mentioned in a [previous post](http://blog.nibblesec.org/2010/12/unspecified-vulnerabilities.html)), I've decided to briefly explain this interesting flaw.

From the advisory, we can actually deduce two important concepts:
> A Remote File Disclosure vulnerability in the jumpUrl mechanism [..] Because of a non-typesafe comparison between the submitted and the calculated hash, it is possible [..]

In a nutshell, the JumpUrl mechanism allows to track access on web pages and provided files (e.g. /index.php?id=2&type=0&jumpurl=/etc/passwd&juSecure=1&locationData=2%3a&juHash=2b1928bfab)

The patch (see this [shell script](http://typo3.org/fileadmin/security-team/bug15898/fix_15898.sh)) simply replaces the two equal signs with three (loose vs strict comparisons).

That's the affected code:
[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5TMxqPSTp9k/TRtMAaF_hZI/AAAAAAAACiw/9Xes12EUHIE/s400/typo3code.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5TMxqPSTp9k/TRtMAaF_hZI/AAAAAAAACiw/9Xes12EUHIE/s1600/typo3code.jpg)

Having this knowledge, it is probably clear to the reader that the overall goal is to bypass the comparison between $juHash and $calcJuHash. While the former is user supplied (string or array), the latter is derived from a substr(md5\_value,10) (string).

In PHP, comparisons involving numerical strings result in unexpected behaviors (at least for me before studying this [chapter](http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php)).
> If you compare a number with a string or the comparison involves numerical strings, then each string is converted to a number and the comparison performed numerically

> If the string does not contain any of the characters '.', 'e', or 'E' and the numeric value fits into integer type limits (as defined by PHP\_INT\_MAX), the string will be evaluated as an integer. In all other cases it will be evaluated as a float.

For instance, the following comparisons are always TRUE:
> if(0=="php")-> TRUE
> if(12=="12php")-> TRUE
> if(110=="110")-> TRUE
> if(100=="10E1")-> TRUE
> if(array()==NULL) -> TRUE
> [..]

And again, also the following comparisons are TRUE:
> If("0"=="0E19280311"){}
> If("0"=="0E00106552"){}
> If("0"=="0E81046233"){}

Consequently, we can pad and wait till the substring of an md5 hash resembles this form. If you do the math, you will discover that the combined probability of having such calculated hash is considerably less than pure bruteforcing.
> ~37037037 max trials (worth case) VS 3656158440062976 all possibilities

In practice, the number of iterations is even less as "0000E13131" and similar strings are also accepted.

To further improve this attack, I've discovered another bypass (TYPO3-SA-2010-022) which allows the disclosure of TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS['SYS']['encryptionKey']. In this way, it is possible to retrieve the key once and download multiple files without repeating the entire process. Using multiple requests, this attack takes a few minutes (8-20 minutes in a local network). A real coder can surely enhance it.

As you can see from the [exploit](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15856/) (posted on The Exploit Database), the fileDenyPattern mechanism bypass is pretty trivial. A demonstration video is also available [here](http://www.ikkisoft.com/stuff/TYPO3-SA-2010-020_video.htm) (slow connection, sorry).

Keep your TYPO3 installation updated! A patch is already available from the [vendor's site](http://typo3.org/download/).

Hello,

Very nice summary. The weak typing of php is very comfortable from a developers point of view.

But this example illustrates undoubtfully, that without strong input validation small mistakes may lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

Regards,

Marc

Package        : typo3-src
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3714 CVE-2010-3715 CVE-2010-3716 CVE-2010-3717

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in TYPO3.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2010-3714
	Multiple remote file disclosure vulnerabilities in the jumpUrl
	mechanism and the Extension Manager allowed attackers to read
	files with the privileges of the account under which the web
	server was running.

CVE-2010-3715
	The TYPO3 backend contained several cross-site scripting
	vulnerabilities, and the RemoveXSS function did not filter
	all Javascript code.

CVE-2010-3716
	Malicious editors with user creation permission could escalate
	their privileges by creating new users in arbitrary groups, due
	to lack of input validation in the taskcenter.

CVE-2010-3717
	TYPO3 exposed a crasher bug in the PHP filter_var function,
	enabling attackers to cause the web server process to crash
	and thus consume additional system resources.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.5-1+lenny6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable
distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version
4.3.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your TYPO3 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
