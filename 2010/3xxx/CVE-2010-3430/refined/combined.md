Oh, hang on.  Re-read some older messages again trying to grok this and
it looks like these checks were introduced in 1.1.2, so they would _not_
affect earlier versions if I'm understanding correctly.

So only 3316 and the second issue without a CVE name affect pre-1.1.2.

So what about previous versions that _don't_ have privilege switching in
pam_env and pam_mail?  Would that require yet another CVE or would the
addition of privilege switching be considered an enhancement, not a
security fix?

The patch that fixes CVE-2010-3430 and CVE-2010-3431 was just made public:
<http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=pam_modutil_priv>

Besides that, another two issues have been fixed in pam_xauth after
Linux-PAM 1.1.2 release:

In pam_sm_close_session(), the attempt to unlink cookie file was made
without dropping privileges at all if target uid could not be determined:
<http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=Linux-PAM-1_1_2-3-g05dafc0>

In check_acl(), there were no check that the acl file provided by target
user is a regular file:
<http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=Linux-PAM-1_1_2-2-gffe7058>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Linux-PAM: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201206-31**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Linux-PAM, allowing
local attackers to possibly gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, corrupt data, or obtain sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/pam** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.5** |

### Background

Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is an architecture allowing
the separation of the development of privilege granting software from the
development of secure and appropriate authentication schemes.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Linux-PAM. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could use specially crafted files to cause a buffer
overflow, possibly resulting in privilege escalation or Denial of
Service. Furthermore, a local attacker could execute specially crafted
programs or symlink attacks, possibly resulting in data loss or
disclosure of sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Linux-PAM users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/pam-1.1.5"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since November 25, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.

Older versions were "fully vulnerable".  1.1.2 is "partially vulnerable".

Yes, in a sense.

I think it should be considered a security fix.  Moreover, of these four
issues (if we keep the separation above), the currently-CVE-less is the
most serious one.

Let's use CVE-2010-3316 for the above flaw.

This one is a bit on the tricky side. I'm going to call it "improper
setfsuid use" so we can use just one CVE instead of two (as the flaws are
related):

Use CVE-2010-3430

Steve, feel free to overrule me if MITRE doesn't like this.

Thanks.

Subject: Re: Minor security flaw with pam_xauth

Dmitry has produced a patch against Linux-PAM 1.1.2 with the fixes
mentioned in the quoted message below.

<http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/pam/>

This is Linux-PAM-1.1.2-up-20101011.diff (same as the changes made
upstream) and Linux-PAM-1.1.2-owl-Makefile.diff.

We already have this in Owl, documented as follows:

2010/10/18	Package: pam
SECURITY FIX	Severity: none to medium, local, active
Updated to 1.1.2+ snapshot 20101011.  This code revision introduces the
proper privilege switching into pam_env, pam_mail, and pam_xauth.  None
of these modules are in use on default installs of Owl, and they never
were, hence there was no impact for default installs.

I am posting this in case others want to have the issues fixed before
the 1.1.3 release comes out.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=641361#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-08 14:16:04 UTC  ``` The pam_mail and pam_env modules in Linux-PAM before 1.1.2 did not drop privileges before accessing users' files ([CVE-2010-3435](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3435), see [bug #641335](show_bug.cgi?id=641335 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3435 pam: pam_env and pam_mail accessing users' file with root privileges")).  Privilege dropping was added in 1.1.2, but with couple of issues pointed out by Solar Designer:  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3311/focus=3534](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3311/focus%3D3534)  The code fails to switch fsgid/egid and groups ([CVE-2010-3430](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3430)) and does not check setfsuid() return value ([CVE-2010-3431](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3431)).  Fix using newly-introduced pam_modutil_drop_priv / pam_modutil_regain_priv was committed in upstream CVS and should be included in 1.1.3: <http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=843807a3a90f52e7538be756616510730a24739a>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=641361#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-08 14:19:01 UTC  ``` Linux-PAM 1.1.2 is currently only available in Fedora Rawhide.  Older PAM versions do to contain affected privilege dropping code and hence can not be affected by these issues.  The are affected by the original issue - [CVE-2010-3435](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3435).  Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of pam as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, or 6.   ``` |  |

This is fixed in Linux-PAM 1.1.2:

<http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=06f882f30092a39a1db867c9744b2ca8d60e4ad6>

The same commit also introduces previously-missing privilege switching
into pam_env and pam_mail.  Unfortunately, this pam_env and pam_mail fix
is incomplete: it only switches the fsuid (should also switch fsgid (or
egid) and groups), and it fails to check the return value from setfsuid()
(doing so would require duplicate calls to setfsuid(), like we do in
libtcb, or switching of euid instead - yet it is desirable).

The pam_env and pam_mail issue was discovered by Sebastian Krahmer of SuSE.

No, they are not fully fixed at all.  We're working on a patch (so you
don't need to).  The commit has the mentioned partial fixes only.

This is the same question asked different ways.  We have a patch that
we're reviewing internally.  To be made available soon.

The original pam_env and pam_mail issues, yes.  The partial fixes, no,
because there were no fixes at all before 1.1.2.

They're relatively minor because these modules are normally not used.
However, if the modules are used in a PAM stack on a given install, then
the original issues reported against pam_env and pam_mail by Sebastian
become major ones.

Additionally, as mentioned by Sebastian, pam_env's intended behavior is
a security risk (user-provided env vars may affect some services in ways
not expected by the sysadmin).  I am not sure how to deal with that.
Maybe improve the documentation.

...and the missing setgroups().

OK.  BTW, I think this is not exploitable on current kernels, at least
not via RLIMIT_NPROC (it does not apply to fsuid), yet it is desirable
to check the return value from such syscalls.

What about the completely missing privilege switching in pre-1.1.2 (the
bug found by Sebastian)?  I don't recall if it already had a CVE id
assigned or not.

pam_xauth missing return value checks from setuid() and similar calls,
fixed in Linux-PAM 1.1.2 - CVE-2010-3316

pam_env and pam_mail accessing the target user's files as root (and thus
susceptible to attacks by the user) in Linux-PAM below 1.1.2, partially
fixed in 1.1.2 - no CVE ID mentioned yet

pam_env and pam_mail in Linux-PAM 1.1.2 not switching fsgid (or egid)
and groups when accessing the target user's files (and thus potentially
susceptible to attacks by the user) - CVE-2010-3430

pam_env and pam_mail in Linux-PAM 1.1.2 not checking whether the
setfsuid() calls succeed (no known impact with current Linux kernels,
but poor practice in general) - CVE-2010-3431

Now, in case someone fixes CVE-2010-3430 but fails to add return value
checks for the added calls, we'll need yet another CVE ID for the
partial fix... but I hope this won't happen.

Things get tricky once you get to such low levels of detail, and this is
the area where there's a little bit of wiggle room.  At one level, you
could call it "improper switching of privileges."  Or you could split at
the level of the individual bugs.

One way that helps to clarify such things is: "if I fix X, will Y be
rendered neutral?"  In this case, if you don't switch fsgid/egid and
groups, you still have an unchecked return value that could cause problems
if setfsuid() fails.  The converse also appears true - even if you check
the result to setfsuid, you still run with the wrong group IDs.  (Note
that this "independent bug fix" is actually the opposite of when you merge
things of the same bug type, and this kind of approach will get more and
more complicated as the more-obvious bugs get eliminated from the affected
code).

In this case, I would argue for two CVEs.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

These that are partially fixed are fixed in that git commit you noted
previously?

<http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=06f882f30092a39a1db867c9744b2ca8d60e4ad6>

Or are they fixed in different commits?  It looks like they should all
be fixed in that commit, but I want to double-check.

Are there patches available to fully fix these issues?  And are there
patches for 3430 and 3431 yet?  I'm assuming also that those issues have
always existed although you say 'in 1.1.2', but they would affect
earlier versions yet, right?

Thanks for any clarification.  I'm trying to wrap my head around this
and the impact of these issues.  They all strike me as relatively minor
issues, but it is possible that I am missing or misunderstanding
something here.

MITRE votes for two, so here goes:

Let's use CVE-2010-3430 for the missing setfsgid.

Use CVE-2010-3431 for the missing return checks on setfsuid.

Thanks Steve.
