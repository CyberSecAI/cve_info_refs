{
  "CVE-2010-3328": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. Specifically, the flaw is within the `CAttrArray::PrivateFind` function in `mshtml.dll`. Setting a specific property of a stylesheet object can force the code to free an object, which is then accessed later.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory corruption",
       "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser, potentially gaining the same user rights. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage.",
       "Opening a malicious file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted web page or file. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability by visiting the malicious page or opening the malicious file."
  }
