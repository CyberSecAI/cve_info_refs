## Details

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and

SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject

arbitrary content at the beginning of the user's session. USN-923-1

disabled SSL/TLS renegotiation by default; this update implements

the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC 5746,

and thus supports secure renegotiation between updated clients and

servers. ([CVE-2009-3555](/security/CVE-2009-3555))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate

request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker to

trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients. ([CVE-2010-3541](/security/CVE-2010-3541))

It was discovered that JNDI could leak information that would allow an

attacker to to access information about otherwise-protected internal

network names. ([CVE-2010-3548](/security/CVE-2010-3548))

It was discovered that HttpURLConnection improperly handled the

"chunked" transfer encoding method, which could allow attackers to

conduct HTTP response splitting attacks. ([CVE-2010-3549](/security/CVE-2010-3549))

It was discovered that the NetworkInterface class improperly

checked the network "connect" permissions for local network

addresses. This could allow an attacker to read local network

addresses. ([CVE-2010-3551](/security/CVE-2010-3551))

It was discovered that UIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection

usage, allowing an attacker to create objects. ([CVE-2010-3553](/security/CVE-2010-3553))

It was discovered that multiple flaws in the CORBA reflection

implementation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by

misusing permissions granted to certain system objects. ([CVE-2010-3554](/security/CVE-2010-3554))

It was discovered that unspecified flaws in the Swing library could

allow untrusted applications to modify the behavior and state of

certain JDK classes. ([CVE-2010-3557](/security/CVE-2010-3557))

It was discovered that the privileged accept method of the ServerSocket

class in the CORBA implementation allowed it to receive connections

from any host, instead of just the host of the current connection.

An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined by

network permissions. ([CVE-2010-3561](/security/CVE-2010-3561))

It was discovered that there exists a double free in java's

indexColorModel that could allow an attacker to cause an applet

or application to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privilege of the user running the java applet or

application. ([CVE-2010-3562](/security/CVE-2010-3562))

It was discovered that the Kerberos implementation improperly checked

AP-REQ requests, which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of

service against the receiving JVM. ([CVE-2010-3564](/security/CVE-2010-3564))

It was discovered that improper checks of unspecified image metadata in

JPEGImageWriter.writeImage of the imageio API could allow an attacker

to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running a

java applet or application. ([CVE-2010-3565](/security/CVE-2010-3565))

It was discovered that an unspecified vulnerability in the ICC

profile handling code could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user running a java applet or

application. ([CVE-2010-3566](/security/CVE-2010-3566))

It was discovered that a miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering

implementation would allow out-of-bounds memory access. This could

allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user running a java application. ([CVE-2010-3567](/security/CVE-2010-3567))

It was discovered that an unspecified race condition in the way

objects were deserialized could allow an attacker to cause an applet

or application to misuse the privileges of the user running the java

applet or application. ([CVE-2010-3568](/security/CVE-2010-3568))

It was discovered that the defaultReadObject of the Serialization

API could be tricked into setting a volatile field multiple times.

This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user running a java applet or application.

([CVE-2010-3569](/security/CVE-2010-3569))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate

request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker to

trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients. ([CVE-2010-3573](/security/CVE-2010-3573))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class improperly checked

whether the calling code was granted the "allowHttpTrace" permission,

allowing an attacker to create HTTP TRACE requests. ([CVE-2010-3574](/security/CVE-2010-3574))

The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010

## Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE and Java for Business also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 29 new security fixes across Java SE and Java for Business products.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below.  Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

| Java SE | Patch Availability |
| --- | --- |
| JDK and JRE 6 Update 21 and earlier for Windows, Solaris, and Linux | [Java SE](/security-alerts/javacpuoct2010.html) |
| JDK 5.0 Update 25 and earlier for Solaris | [Java SE](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=299347658170291&id=1231283.1) |
| SDK 1.4.2\_27 and earlier for Solaris | [Java SE](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=299347658170291&id=1231283.1) |

### Patch Availability Table and Risk Matrix

Java SE and Java for Business fixes in this Update are cumulative; the latest Critical Patch Update includes all fixes from the previous Critical Patch Updates.

#### Patch Availability Table

| Product Group | Risk Matrix | Patch Availability and Installation Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oracle Java SE and Java for Business | [Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Risk Matrix](#AppendixJAVA) | Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Critical Patch Update October 2010 [My Oracle Support Note 1215628.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=299148156731669&id=1215628.1)  Consumer users of Oracle Java SE can download the latest release from http://java.com. Users on the Windows platform can also use [automatic updates](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/5000020700.xml) to get the latest release |

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. Hence Oracle recommends that customers upgrade their Oracle products to a supported version.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle: an Anonymous Reporter of TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Berend-Jan Wever of Google; Chris Ries of Carnegie Mellon University; iDefense Security alias of iDefense; Intevydis via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Marc Schoenefeld of Red Hat; Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor; Matthias Kaiser (mka) via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Roberto Suggi Liverani of Security-Assessment.com; Shane Garrett of IBM X-Force; Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security; Stephen Fewer of Harmony Security via Tippingpoint; Steve Dispensa of PhoneFactor; Tavis Ormandy of Google; and Thomas Stehle.

#### Security-In-Depth Contributors

Oracle provides recognition to people that have contributed to our Security-In-Depth program (see [FAQ](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html)). People are recognized for Security-In-Depth contributions if they provide information, observations or suggestions pertaining to security vulnerability issues that result in significant modification of Oracle code or documentation in future releases, but are not of such a critical nature that they are distributed in Critical Patch Updates.

For this Critical Patch Update, Oracle recognizes Stefano Di Paola of Minded Security for contributions to Oracle's Security-In-Depth program.

#### Oracle Java SE and Java for Business Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 29 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE and Java for Business.  28 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.

CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). Where the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial+" instead of "Complete", and the corresponding CVSS Base scores are 7.5, 6.8, and 5.1 instead of 10, 9.3, and 7.6 respectively.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?_afrLoop=299400827694721&id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include a JDK.

**Affected Versions:**
HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23 and B.11.31 running HP JDK and JRE
6.0.09 or earlier

HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23 and B.11.31 running HP JDK and JRE 5.0.21 or earlier

HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23 and B.11.31 running HP Java SDK and RTE 1.4.2.26 or
earlier

More information about this vulnerability can be found in the security advisory issued by HP:

* <http://alerts.hp.com/r?2.1.3KT.2ZR.zERGu.FLa3n%5f..T.VVow.3%2a3q.bW89MQ%5f%5fDBQMFQR0>

## 2. Avaya System Products with HP-UX Running Java:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Proactive Contact | 3.0.x | Low | Upgrade to PC 4.2.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
Specially crafted ppt files could cause a heap based buffer overflow in
OpenOffice\_org Impress. Attackers could exploit that to crash
OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936).
This update also fixes numerous non-security bugs. Please refer to the

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update
implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC
5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3555.html) to this issue.

access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2011

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2011

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. It also includes non-security fixes that are required (because of interdependencies) by those security patches. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative, except as noted below, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 66 new security fixes across all product families listed below.

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Products and Versions column.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1263374.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=294981013317647&id=1263374.1).

### Unsupported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/).

We recommend that customers upgrade to a supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches. Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=294981271434718&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1263374.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=294981013317647&id=1263374.1) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

```
```

3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.
```
```
    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch
    =============  ========  =======  =================
    vCenter        4.1       Windows  Update 1
    vCenter        4.0       Windows  Update 3
    VirtualCenter  2.5       Windows  affected, no patch planned
```
```
    Update Manager 4.1       Windows  Update 1
    Update Manager 4.0       Windows  Update 3
    Update Manager 1.0       Windows  affected, no patch planned
```
```

    ESXi           any       ESXi     not affected
```
```
    ESX            any       ESX      not affected
```
```
  * Hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Fusion.
```
```
 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.
```
```
    VMware would like to thank Claudio Criscione of Secure Networking
    for reporting this issue to us.
```

java-1.6.0-openjdk security and bug fix update (RHSA-2010-0768)

Original Release Date: October 29, 2010

Last Revised: August 20, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-308

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit.

defaultReadObject of the Serialization API could be tricked into setting a
volatile field multiple times, which could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the applet
or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3569](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3569.html) to this issue.

Race condition in the way objects were deserialized could allow an
untrusted applet or application to misuse the privileges of the user
running the applet or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3568](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3568.html) to this issue.

Miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering implementation caused
out-of-bounds memory access, which could allow remote attackers to execute
code with the privileges of the user running the java process.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3567](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3567.html) to this issue.

JPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the imageio API improperly checked certain
image metadata, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the user running the applet or application.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3565](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3565.html) to this issue.

Double free in IndexColorModel could cause an untrusted applet or
application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the applet or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3562](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3562.html) to this issue.

The privileged accept method of the ServerSocket class in the Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) implementation in OpenJDK allowed it to
receive connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current
connection. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined
by network permissions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3561](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3561.html) to this issue.

Flaws in the Swing library could allow an untrusted application to modify
the behavior and state of certain JDK classes. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3557](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3557.html) to this issue.

Flaws in the CORBA implementation could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code by misusing permissions granted to certain system objects.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3554](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3554.html) to this issue.

UIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection usage, allowing untrusted
callers to create objects via ProxyLazyValue values. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3553](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3553.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection improperly handled the "chunked" transfer encoding
method, which could allow remote attackers to conduct HTTP response
splitting attacks. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3549](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3549.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection improperly checked whether the calling code was granted
the "allowHttpTrace" permission, allowing untrusted code to create HTTP
TRACE requests. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3574](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3574.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection did not validate request headers set by applets, which
could allow remote attackers to trigger actions otherwise restricted to
HTTP clients. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-3541](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3541.html) and [CVE-2010-3573](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3573.html) to these issues.

The Kerberos implementation improperly checked the sanity of AP-REQ
requests, which could cause a denial of service condition in the receiving
Java Virtual Machine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3564](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3564.html) to this issue.

The RHSA-2010:0339 update mitigated a man-in-the-middle attack in the way
the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update
implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC
5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3555.html) to this issue.

The NetworkInterface class improperly checked the network "connect"
permissions for local network addresses, which could allow remote attackers
to read local network addresses. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3551](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3551.html) to this issue.

Information leak flaw in the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
could allow a remote attacker to access information about
otherwise-protected internal network names. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3548](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3548.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0768.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.6.0-openjdk installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0 | Medium | See recommended actions and Mitigating Factors table below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. It is recommended that customers migrate to one of Avaya's conferencing solutions including Aura® Conferencing 7.0 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Platform | 1.1, 6.0 thru 6.0.3.5.3 | Low | Upgrade to SP6.0 Patch 6.0.3.6.3 or later. Rated a Low Risk since the jdk in Domain-0 is not a daemon and is used in a very limited fashion for a single application that is not accessible through the network interface. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
