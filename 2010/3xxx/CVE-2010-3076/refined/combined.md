# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2103-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Giuseppe Iuculano
September 05, 2010                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : smbind
Vulnerability  : sql injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : none assigned yet

It was discovered that smbind, a PHP-based tool for managing DNS zones
for BIND, does not properly validating input.
An unauthenticated remote attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands
or gain access to the admin account.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.7-3+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.7-5, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your smbind (0.4.7-3+lenny1) package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Debian (stable)
- ---------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.
