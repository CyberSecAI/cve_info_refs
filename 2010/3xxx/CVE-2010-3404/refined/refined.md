- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL Injection vulnerability in the `catlgsearch.aspx` page of eshtery CMS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `Criteria` field on the `catlgsearch.aspx` page is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords from the `Admins` table, by injecting malicious SQL queries.
    - An attacker can then bypass the authentication mechanism by using extracted credentials or by exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability in the login page.
    - Successful exploitation leads to complete compromise of the CMS.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is a web request to the vulnerable `catlgsearch.aspx` page.
    - The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within the `Criteria` parameter.
    - Another attack vector is the login page, where the attacker uses SQL injection on the username field to bypass authentication (`username: admin' or '1'='1`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to make web requests to the vulnerable application.
    - No prior authentication is required to exploit the `catlgsearch.aspx` SQLi vulnerability.
    - Basic understanding of SQL injection and how to craft malicious SQL queries.
