Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-3602:

**Vulnerability 1 (CSRF File Move)**
*   **Root Cause:** A lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the `FileService.ashx` service.
*   **Weaknesses:** The `FileService.ashx` service allows moving files based on parameters provided in the URL without proper verification of the request's origin.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can move the `user.config` file, causing the site to fail during the next application pool recycle. This file contains critical connection string information.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** By renaming the `user.config` file, an attacker can then download it, gaining access to sensitive data such as the database connection string and potentially other configuration details.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Social engineering attack: An attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious website.
    *   The malicious site then uses JavaScript to make a request to the vulnerable `FileService.ashx` service on the target site.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to craft a malicious webpage that can execute JavaScript.
    *   Ability to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious site.
    *   Knowledge of the target site URL.

**Vulnerability 2 (Persistent XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the user registration process.
*   **Weaknesses:** User-supplied data for the username/id is not properly sanitized when being included in the page title in the ProfileView.aspx.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the user name/id field during registration. When other users view the profile of the compromised user, the malicious script will be executed in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker registers a new user account with a crafted username containing malicious JavaScript.
    *   Other users who visit the profile page of the attacker are then exposed to the injected script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to register on the affected site.
    *   Ability to inject the malicious payload during the registration process.

**Mitigating Factors for Vulnerability 1:**
*  The attack requires a targeted social engineering attack against a specific admin user and a specific site.
* The web process must have write permissions to the root directory for the move command to work.
*  Javascript needs to be enabled in the admin's browser.

**Mitigating Factors for Vulnerability 2:**
* The user name/id is html encoded when shown on the member list.
*  Sites can configure a regular expression for user name/id validation that would prevent this.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content mentions a third potential issue related to an ASP.NET vulnerability (related to the machine key) but this was not confirmed, nor was it directly related to CVE-2010-3602. The advisory does provide workarounds.
*   The document mentions that the vulnerabilities exist in mojoPortal 2.3.4.3 and 2.3.5.1, and were fixed in 2.3.5.2.
*   The vendor recommends upgrading to the latest version to address the security issues.
