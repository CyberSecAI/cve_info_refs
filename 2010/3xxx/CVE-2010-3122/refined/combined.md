## DevonIT weak authentication and buffer overflow in /usr/bin/tm-console-bin

#### Vulnerability Note VU#278785

Original Release Date: 2010-08-24 | Last Revised: 2010-08-24

---

### Overview

The DevonIT management tool for thin clients uses a shared secret that is transmitted over the network in the clear. The /usr/bin/tm-console-bin application contains a buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The management tool transmits an unencrypted shared secret over the network to authenticate with clients. This traffic can then be used by an attacker to mimic a thin-manager server and control thin clients. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker able to sniff traffic created by the management tool will be able to compromise the configuration of thin clients. An attacker may be able to exploit a buffer overflow in /usr/bin/tm-console-bin to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**  Implement appropriate firewall rules so clients will only talk to a legitimate management server. |
