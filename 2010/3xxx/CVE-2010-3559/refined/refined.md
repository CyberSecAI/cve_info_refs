  "CVE-2010-3559": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the support for processing SoundBank files. While parsing BANK records, the HeadspaceSoundbank.nGetName function improperly sign-extends the one byte value into 4 bytes. It is later used as the size to a memcpy when operating on the BANK record's data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Improper Memory Copy"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java Runtime.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to lure the victim to a malicious page or have the user open a malicious file. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
