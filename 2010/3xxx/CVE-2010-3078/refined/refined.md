{
  "CVE-2010-3078": {
    "Root cause": "The `XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR` ioctl in the Linux kernel's XFS filesystem allows unprivileged users to read uninitialized stack memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure vulnerability due to lack of initialization of `fsx_pad` member of the `fsxattr` structure before copying it back to user space."
    ],
    "Impact": "Unprivileged local users can read 12 bytes of uninitialized stack memory, potentially leaking sensitive information. This could lead to a loss of privacy.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR` ioctl.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system with the ability to make ioctl calls. No specific privileges are required."
  }
