  "CVE-2010-3436": {
    "description": "fopen_wrappers.c in PHP 5.3.x through 5.3.3 might allow remote attackers to bypass open_basedir restrictions via vectors related to the length of a filename.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how PHP handles filenames within the fopen_wrappers.c component, specifically regarding the length of filenames, potentially leading to bypassing open_basedir restrictions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Insufficient length checks"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially bypass the `open_basedir` restriction, gaining unauthorized access to files outside the designated directories.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation by sending specially crafted filenames."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests with malicious file path"

    "related_information": [
      "The vulnerability is related to how filename length is handled in fopen_wrappers.c",
      "This vulnerability affects PHP versions 5.3.x up to 5.3.3.",
