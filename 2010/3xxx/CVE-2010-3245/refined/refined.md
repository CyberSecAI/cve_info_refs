{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Blackboard Transact application has two vulnerabilities: 1) The BbtsConnection_Edit.exe utility decrypts most fields in the connection.xml file, but not the <Password> field. However, if the content of the <Password> field is copied into another field, the utility will display the decrypted password. 2) Database credentials are stored in clear text in backup scripts and batch files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of sensitive data during decryption process",
      "Storage of sensitive information in clear text",
       "Insufficient access controls to sensitive files."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the BbtsConnection_Edit.exe and connection.xml file or read access to the backup scripts can obtain the database username and password.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the BbtsConnection_Edit.exe utility and connection.xml file.",
      "Read access to backup scripts and batch files."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have access to the server and specific files to exploit the vulnerabilities."
