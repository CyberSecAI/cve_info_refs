  "cve": "CVE-2010-3216",
  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Word handles bookmarks when parsing a specially crafted Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Microsoft Word handles bookmarks when parsing a specially crafted Word file, which can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of bookmarks during parsing of Word files",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, including arbitrary code execution, installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted Word file to a user and convincing them to open it, either as an email attachment or by hosting it on a website.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious Word document. They require social engineering to convince the victim to open it."
