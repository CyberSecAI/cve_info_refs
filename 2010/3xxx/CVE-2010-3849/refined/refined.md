Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-3849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `econet_sendmsg` function in the Linux kernel's Econet protocol implementation does not properly handle a NULL remote address (`saddr`) passed as an argument when sending a message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access the `cookie` member of the `saddr` structure without checking if `saddr` is NULL. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference.
   ```c
   /* BUG: saddr may be NULL */
   eb->cookie = saddr->cookie;
   ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a kernel oops (crash), resulting in a denial of service. The system becomes unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A local user can trigger this vulnerability.
- **`sendmsg` System Call:** The vulnerability is triggered by making a `sendmsg` system call to the kernel, providing a NULL value for the remote address field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the system.
- **Ability to call `sendmsg`:** The attacker must have the ability to make system calls, specifically the `sendmsg` call.
- **Econet Address Configured:** An Econet address must be configured on the system for this vulnerability to be triggered.  It should be noted that CVE-2010-3850 also affects configuration of the address and together they create a very exploitable situation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in both the hardware and UDP emulation cases of `econet_sendmsg`.
- The issue is described as "easily exploitable for an oops," although more serious exploits are not directly identified.
- This is part of a set of Econet-related vulnerabilities, alongside CVE-2010-3848 (stack overflow) and CVE-2010-3850 (missing privilege check).
- A patch was created and has a commit ID : `http://git.kernel.org/linus/fa0e846494792e722d817b9d3d625a4ef4896c96`
