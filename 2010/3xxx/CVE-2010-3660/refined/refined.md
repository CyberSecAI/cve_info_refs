```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user input in various parts of the TYPO3 CMS backend and frontend, leading to multiple security issues.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Open Redirection",
    "SQL Injection",
    "Broken Authentication and Session Management",
    "Insecure Randomness",
    "Information Disclosure",
    "Arbitrary Code Execution",
    "Spam Abuse",
    "Header Injection"
  ],
  "Impact": "Attackers can execute arbitrary code, perform SQL injections, redirect users to malicious sites, steal sessions, send spam, manipulate headers and leak sensitive information. These vulnerabilities could lead to complete compromise of the TYPO3 CMS application and underlying systems.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Network access via web requests to the TYPO3 backend and frontend.",
    "Exploitation of vulnerable backend record editing forms, extensions and install tool.",
    "Manipulation of form parameters, request parameters, and file upload features."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the following capabilities depending on the specific vulnerability:\n  - A valid backend login for exploiting XSS, open redirection, and SQL injection in the backend.\n  - An editor role with record editing rights to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n  - A valid admin user login for exploiting the Extension Manager XSS vulnerability and potential file access/edit.\n  - Knowledge of the TYPO3 CMS application architecture and how it handles user inputs.\n - Ability to craft specific malicious payloads, forge requests, upload files, and send malformed mail headers.\n  - For Insecure Randomness in the "forgot password" feature, the attacker needs enough attempts to brute force a hash within a given timeframe.\n - For the install tool session fixation attack the attacker needs to trick the victim to visit a malicious link and then take over the session"
