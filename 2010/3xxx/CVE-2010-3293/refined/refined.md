{
  "CVE-2010-3293": {
    "Description": "mailscanner can allow local users to prevent virus signatures from being updated",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `update_virus_scanners` script uses `/tmp/MailScanner.autoupdate.lock` as a lockfile and exits if it's a file (not a symlink) and has been recently modified. This behavior can be abused by local users.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper lock file handling",
      "Insecure file creation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local users can prevent virus signatures from being updated, potentially leading to systems being vulnerable to malware that would otherwise be detected.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to the system where MailScanner is installed"
  }
