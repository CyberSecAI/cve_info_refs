Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `tangerine` and `tangerine-properties` scripts modify the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable by prepending `${exec_prefix}/lib/tangerine:` to it.
- If `${exec_prefix}/lib/tangerine` is empty or resolves to an empty string,  it results in a zero-length entry in the colon-separated `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` list.
- `ld.so` interprets an empty entry in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as the current working directory (`.`).

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- Insecure library loading due to the inclusion of the current working directory in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- This allows an attacker to place a malicious shared library (a Trojan horse) in the directory from which the vulnerable script is executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the `tangerine` or `tangerine-properties` scripts.
- Potential for privilege escalation if the scripts are executed with elevated permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can create a malicious shared library (e.g., `libc.so.6`) in a directory where a vulnerable `tangerine` script is executed.
- When the script runs, it loads the malicious library from the current working directory due to the insecure `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to write files to a directory where the vulnerable scripts are executed.
- No special privileges needed prior to exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2010-3381.
- The issue was fixed in `tangerine` version `0.3.2.2-6`.
- The Debian bug report references a patch for the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is described as a "grave" security issue.
