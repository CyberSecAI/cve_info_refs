Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the Photos application using HTTP Basic authentication when no other authentication mechanism is presented by the server during a "Send to MobileMe" action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of proper authentication handling:** The Photos app doesn't enforce secure authentication methods and falls back to HTTP Basic authentication, which is vulnerable to interception.
*   **Vulnerable protocol:** The use of HTTP Basic authentication transmits credentials in a easily decoded format, making it susceptible to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of MobileMe account password:** An attacker can intercept the base64 encoded password sent during authentication and compromise the user's MobileMe account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** The attacker needs to be positioned within a privileged network position (e.g., on the same WiFi network) to intercept the network traffic between the iOS device and the MobileMe server.
*   **Manipulation of server response:** The attacker needs to manipulate the server response to force the Photos application to use basic authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged network position:** The attacker must be on the same network as the victim.
*   **Network traffic interception capability:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic.
*   **Ability to manipulate the server's response:** The attacker must be able to alter the server's responses to the Photos app to trigger the insecure authentication method.
