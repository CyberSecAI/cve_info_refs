Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `gnome-subtitles` script incorrectly constructs the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable by including an empty directory. This occurs because the script uses `$libdir/gnome-subtitles:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` where `$libdir` can be an empty string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure library loading:** When `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` contains an empty entry, `ld.so` interprets it as the current working directory (`.`). This allows an attacker to place a malicious shared library in the current working directory, which will be loaded by `gnome-subtitles` instead of the intended library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `gnome-subtitles`, by placing a trojan horse shared library in a directory where the vulnerable script is executed from.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have write access to the directory where the vulnerable script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local user:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- **Write access:** The attacker must be able to write files in the directory from which the vulnerable `gnome-subtitles` script is executed.
- **Knowledge of vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerability to exploit it.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Raphael Geissert.
- The fix involves ensuring that the directory added to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not empty.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `gnome-subtitles` version `1.0-2`.
- Upstream fix was provided by dai, based on the work of Pedro Castro.
- The vulnerability was assigned a severity of "grave" in Debian.
- Red Hat bug 638384 is related to this CVE.
