{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uTorrent (versions 2.0.3 and prior) is vulnerable to DLL hijacking due to insecure DLL loading practices.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "DLL Hijacking",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running uTorrent.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL (renamed to a specific name) in the same directory as the uTorrent executable, and then cause uTorrent to load it. The application will load the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to write files to the uTorrent install directory."
