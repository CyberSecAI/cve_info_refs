{
  "cve": "CVE-2010-3015",
  "description": "Integer overflow in the ext4_ext_get_blocks function in fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash) via a write operation on the last block of a large file, followed by a sync operation.",
  "affected_products": [
    "VMware ESXi and ESX",
    "openSUSE 11.1",
    "SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 11 SP1",
     "SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP1",
    "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1",

  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the ext4_ext_get_blocks function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (BUG and system crash), and potential privilege escalation in some configurations (e.g., RDS socket). Information leaks may also occur in some related vulnerabilities due to missing initialization of structures on the kernel stack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required to trigger vulnerability by performing a write operation on the last block of a large file and syncing.",
      "Malicious routing changes in L2TP may also trigger this vulnerability.",
       "Specific I/O requests with 0 length, or certain extended attribute operations, could cause a kernel panic.",
      "By crafting a specific series of actions involving file system operations including a rename operation on a GFS2 partition."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "Local user with write access to an ext4-mounted file system. Some configurations (e.g., RDS sockets) require access to specific network interfaces or system devices (like /dev/kvm)."
  },
    "additional_notes": "Some documents mention a related issue in gfs2 and a fix related to gfs2_dirent_find_space function in fs/gfs2/dir.c. This vulnerability could be triggered by renaming a file."
