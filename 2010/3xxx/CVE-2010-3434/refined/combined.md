1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- NetworkManager
dbus-glib allowed local users to write properties that were exported
read-only via dbus (CVE-2010-1172).
Affected Products: SLE11
- bind
A DoS vulnerability in bind's DNSSEC code has been
fixed which occured while recursively validating a server.
CVE-2010-0213 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- clamav
clamav version 0.96.3 fixes problems when scanning pdf files
(CVE-2010-3434) and also contains numerous other bug fixes.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- dovecot12
dovecot granted admin rights to all owner mailboxes (CVE-2010-3706).
When using multiple ACL entries for mailboxes the most specific one
was not always applied (CVE-2010-3707).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- festival
festival\_server uses an unsafe LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. Local users could exploit
that to execute code as another user if that user runs festival\_server.
CVE-2010-3996 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- gpg2
GnuPG2 was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by context-dependent
attackers because of reusing a freed pointer when verifying a signature
or importing a certificate with many "Subject Alternate Names".
(CVE-2010-2547)
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.0
- libfreebl3
The Mozilla NSS Library was updated to version 3.12.8 and the Mozilla
NSPR Library was updated to 4.8.6 to fix various bugs and one security
issue.
CVE-2010-3170: Disallow wildcard matching in X509 certificate Common
Names.
This update also has preparations for Firefox 4 support, and a updated
Root Certificate Authority list.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- php5-pear-mail
Passing specially crafted $from and $recepient arguments to
php5-pear-mail's sendmail.php allowed attackers to inject shell
code (CVE-2009-4023, CVE-2009-4111).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- postgresql
PostgreSQL functions implemented in Perl or TCL shared a global state
even across different user user ids. A user could therefore influence
functions of other users in an unexpected or even malicious way
(CVE-2010-3433).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

Must be this commit:
<http://git.clamav.net/gitweb?p=clamav-devel.git;a=commitdiff;h=dc5143b4669ae39c79c9af50d569c28c798f33da>

If bytesleft2 is negative the next memchr would likely cause a
crash. Previous commits in that file also improve bounds checks.

Message-Id: <201009222051.55865.hanno@hboeck.de>
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 2010 20:51:55 +0200
From: Hanno Böck <hanno@...eck.de>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: clamav < 0.96.3 pdf bounds checking

As always, clamav doesn't mention security issues in it's release notes, but
the changelog gives some insight.

The bundled bzip2 code is affected by CVE-2010-0405 which is no surprise.

This however sounds more interesting:
Mon Sep 20 14:50:34 EEST 2010 (edwin)
-------------------------------------
 * libclamav/pdf.c: Add missing boundscheck to pdf code (bb #2226)

The referenced bug report is not public, but it sounds like this deserves a
CVE.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

### [CVEProject/cve-schema](/CVEProject/cve-schema)[Support PURL as identifier](/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/173)

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.
