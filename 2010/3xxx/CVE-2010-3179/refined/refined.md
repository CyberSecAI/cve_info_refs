{
  "CVE-2010-3179": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow occurs due to a failure in Uniscribe when handling long text runs within the `document.write()` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow leading to memory corruption. Specifically,  `CopyItemSplitOversize` function calls Uniscribe's `ScriptBreak()` with a very large text buffer, which causes the function to fail and leads to an inconsistent `textRun` state. This inconsistency leads to invalid memory access, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the call stack and execute arbitrary code.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of the user's system, as demonstrated by overwriting the EIP register.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious web page that uses JavaScript and `document.write()` to insert an extremely long string. When a vulnerable browser renders this page, the buffer overflow occurs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to host a malicious web page or inject malicious code into a website visited by a user. The attacker does not require any privileged access."
