User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8
When giving document.write() a MASSIVE message, a buffer overflow occurs and writes data to the Call Stack, eventually causing the EIP to be manipulated by Javascript.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a debugger (I used Debuggy)
2. Visit the web page
3. In the debugger, check the call stack a couple of times
Actual Results:
I found that 41414141 was written to the call stack, meaning that after normal browser operations, the EIP becomes 41414141 and that obviously leads to code execution, if you change the EIP to point to your shellcode.
Expected Results:
The browser should have frozen or crashed.
This was ONLY tested against windows 7 on an x86 single core processor, results may vary.

It would be great if someone at least vaguely familiar with textruns would look
at this.
My current guess is that TextRunWordCache::LookupWord somehow puts a "word"
with invalid textrun to deferredwords, but I could be wrong.
Btw, on linux glib seems to abort in this case

Attached patch

[patch, v1 - avoid uniscribe failure on long text runs](attachment.cgi?id=469403&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=469403&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=583077&attachment=469403)

This is the 1.9.2 equivalent of patch 1 in [bug 553963](/show_bug.cgi?id=553963 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash in [@ TextRunWordCache::CacheHashEntry::KeyEquals(TextRunWordCache::CacheHashKey const*) const ]") on trunk. The basic issue is that CopyItemSplitOversize does not handle large items correctly; it calls Uniscribe's ScriptBreak() function with a huge text buffer (42 million chars, in the testcase here), which fails. In a debug build, several assertions get triggered, but in a release build we end up with a textRun in an inconsistent state, leading to invalid array accesses, etc.
On trunk, we're able to avoid the use of ScriptBreak here because the font & text restructuring we've done means that we have cluster information already available at this point, but on 1.9.2 that's not the case. So to fix this in a minimally-disruptive way, I have modified CopyItemSplitOversize to use a "sliding window" onto the entire buffer, analyzing a portion at a time so as to avoid the uniscribe limitation.
With this patch, I can no longer reproduce the crash with this testcase, although the browser does become unresponsive for an extended time while creating the huge string, building the textRun, reflowing, etc. However, with sufficient patience (10 minutes or so on my fast desktop) it successfully displays the entire test page of 42 million chinese characters.
On a memory-constrained system, it's still possible that this kind of test would die with an out-of-memory exception, but that should be a "safe" crash.

patch, v1 - avoid uniscribe failure on long text runs
Looks OK. The logic in itemizer loop is a tad hairy, I \*think\* it looks okay but proving that is not a simple exercise.

Are new releases running on the patched trunk? I found evidence of memory corruption on Windows 7 running 3.6.8...

No, "trunk" is Firefox 4 nightlies. For the moment, anyway -- we will create a release branch in the near future and "trunk" will then be ongoing development for whatever comes after "Firefox 4"

patch, v1 - avoid uniscribe failure on long text runs
Requesting approval to land on 1.9.2 and 1.9.1.
This patch prevents us calling Uniscribe with excessively large buffers, such that it fails and we are left with inconsistent text-runs, leading to invalid memory access and potential memory/stack corruption.
The patch resolves the failure and gives correct, safe behavior with the testcase (effectively a stress-test) here. Automated testing to verify this is difficult as the error condition involves huge strings and textruns, and even when handled correctly we're going to experience an apparent "hang" for several minutes, and could experience an out-of-memory exception + crash. (This is the correct result in the event of an allocation failure inside the Uniscribe calls, for example.)

Is this testable/fuzzable?
Throwing large strings at the browser to see what happens seems to be a common attack, ISTR someone filing a bug on this kind of thing nearly monthly. Usually it's just a harmless OOM/DOS. So it seems a bit surprising this was different and not noticed before, but I'd assume people will continue to probe for problems like this.

Hey Alex - I meant to say this earlier when you submitted your bug reports - but it's great to have you helping out. Quit apologizing for your age - you're doing just fine.
Has someone introduced you to our IRC network? You might find it interesting/helpful to hang out there, watch the project go by - it's where we coordinate most things.
I'm abusing bugzilla a little by using it as a chat forum here - if you have any questions or need help with anything, please feel free to email me:

Is this getting a consistent stack trace?

Hate to break bad news. I think Mozilla is on the right track by giving kids 3K (Mozilla should be doing that each month imho) But this "bug" is a duplicate from unicode stack overflow: [Bug 504342](/show_bug.cgi?id=504342 "NEW - Investigate milw0rm 9158 \"unicode stack overflow\""). Found by Andrew Haynes & Simon Berry-Byrne in 2009. I say duplicate, but actually it's copied pasted since it's exactly the same.

What? I actually wrote the testcase myself... Also, doesn't this count as a separate vulnerability because it exploits a different part of Firefox?
Also, according to <http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2009/07/19/milw0rm-9158-stack-overflow-crash-not-exploitable-cve-2009-2479/> [bug 504342](/show_bug.cgi?id=504342 "NEW - Investigate milw0rm 9158 \"unicode stack overflow\"") isn't exploitable.

firefox security update (RHSA-2010-0782)

Original Release Date: November 16, 2010

Last Revised: June 21, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-321

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 7.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox. Network Security Services (NSS) is
a set of libraries designed to support the development of security-enabled
client and server applications.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2010-3175](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3175.html),
[CVE-2010-3176](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3176.html),
[CVE-2010-3179](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3179.html),
[CVE-2010-3183](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3183.html) and
[CVE-2010-3180](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3180.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in Firefox converted text
into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
a victim running Firefox, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the
context of the Gopher domain. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3177](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3177.html) to this issue.

A same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Firefox. An attacker could
create a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal
private data from a different website the victim has loaded with Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3178](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3178.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the script that launches Firefox. The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
Firefox, if that user ran Firefox from within an attacker-controlled
directory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3182.html) to this issue.

It was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode
implementation for key exchanges in Firefox accepted DHE keys that were 256
bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as such
keys are easily broken using modern hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3173](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3173.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way NSS matched SSL certificates when the
certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
address. NSS incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that fell
within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3170](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3170.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox, xulrunner, or nss installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services | 5.2.x | Low | Upgrade to AES 6.1 or later. |
| Avaya Aura® Communication Manager | 6.0.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 6.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
When certain factors determine that the overall risk for a particular product to be set to Low,
Avaya will place these factors in the following table:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-3170 CVE-2010-3173 CVE-2010-3175 CVE-2010-3176 CVE-2010-3177 CVE-2010-3178 CVE-2010-3179 CVE-2010-3180 CVE-2010-3182 CVE-2010-3183 | These vulnerabilities are rated a Low risk as firefox is not a critical application on IALX, MN and MSS and is not installed on AES, CM, Conferencing, IQ, Presence, SM, SMGR, SP, VP or the CS1000. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |

## Details

Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov, Josh Soref, Gary

Kwong, Martijn Wargers, Siddharth Agarwal and Michal Zalewski discovered

various flaws in the browser engine. An attacker could exploit this to

crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-3175](/security/CVE-2010-3175), [CVE-2010-3176](/security/CVE-2010-3176))

Alexander Miller, Sergey Glazunov, and others discovered several flaws in

the JavaScript engine. An attacker could exploit this to crash the browser

or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3179](/security/CVE-2010-3179), [CVE-2010-3180](/security/CVE-2010-3180), [CVE-2010-3183](/security/CVE-2010-3183))

Robert Swiecki discovered that Firefox did not properly validate Gopher

URLs. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted file via Gopher, an

attacker could possibly run arbitrary JavaScript. ([CVE-2010-3177](/security/CVE-2010-3177))

Eduardo Vela Nava discovered that Firefox could be made to violate the

same-origin policy by using modal calls with JavaScript. An attacker could

exploit this to steal information from another site. ([CVE-2010-3178](/security/CVE-2010-3178))

Dmitri GribenkoDmitri Gribenko discovered that Firefox did not properly

setup the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable. A local attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3182](/security/CVE-2010-3182))

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-65

## Buffer overflow and memory corruption using document.write

Announced
October 19, 2010
Reporter
Alexander Miller
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.14
* Firefox 3.6.11
* SeaMonkey 2.0.9
* Thunderbird 3.0.9
* Thunderbird 3.1.5

### Description

Security researcher **Alexander Miller** reported that
passing an excessively long string to `document.write`
could cause text rendering routines to end up in an inconsistent state
with sections of stack memory being overwritten with the string data.
An attacker could use this flaw to crash a victim's browser and
potentially run arbitrary code on their computer.

# USN-998-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

20 October 2010

Thunderbird could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - mail/news client with RSS and integrated spam filter support

## Details

Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov, Josh Soref, Gary

Kwong, Martijn Wargers, Siddharth Agarwal and Michal Zalewski discovered

various flaws in the browser engine. An attacker could exploit this to

crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-3175](/security/CVE-2010-3175), [CVE-2010-3176](/security/CVE-2010-3176))

Alexander Miller, Sergey Glazunov, and others discovered several flaws in

the JavaScript engine. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker could

exploit this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3179](/security/CVE-2010-3179), [CVE-2010-3180](/security/CVE-2010-3180), [CVE-2010-3183](/security/CVE-2010-3183))

Eduardo Vela Nava discovered that Thunderbird could be made to violate the

same-origin policy by using modal calls with JavaScript. If JavaScript were

enabled, an attacker could exploit this to steal information from another

site. ([CVE-2010-3178](/security/CVE-2010-3178))

Dmitri GribenkoDmitri Gribenko discovered that Thunderbird did not properly

setup the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable. A local attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3182](/security/CVE-2010-3182))

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Package        : xulrunner
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3765 CVE-2010-3174 CVE-2010-3176 CVE-2010-3177 CVE-2010-3178 CVE-2010-3179 CVE-2010-3180 CVE-2010-3183

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, the
component that provides the core functionality of Iceweasel, Debian's
variant of Mozilla's browser technology.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2010-3765
	Xulrunner allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
	via vectors related to nsCSSFrameConstructor::ContentAppended,
	the appendChild method, incorrect index tracking, and the
	creation of multiple frames, which triggers memory corruption.

CVE-2010-3174
CVE-2010-3176
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in
	Xulrunner allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	(memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2010-3177
	Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the
	Gopher parser in Xulrunner allow remote attackers to inject
	arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted name of a (1) file
	or (2) directory on a Gopher server.

CVE-2010-3178
	Xulrunner does not properly handle certain modal calls made by
	javascript: URLs in circumstances related to opening a new
	window and performing cross-domain navigation, which allows
	remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a
	crafted HTML document.

CVE-2010-3179
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the text-rendering
	functionality in Xulrunner allows remote attackers to execute
	arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption
	and application crash) via a long argument to the
	document.write method.

CVE-2010-3180
	Use-after-free vulnerability in the nsBarProp function in
	Xulrunner allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
	accessing the locationbar property of a closed window.

CVE-2010-3183
	The LookupGetterOrSetter function in Xulrunner does not
	properly support window.__lookupGetter__ function calls that
	lack arguments, which allows remote attackers to execute
	arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer
	dereference and application crash) via a crafted HTML
	document.

In addition, this security update includes corrections for regressions
caused by the fixes for CVE-2010-0654 and CVE-2010-2769 in DSA-2075-1
and DSA-2106-1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.19-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable
distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.15-1 of the iceweasel package.

We recommend that you upgrade your Xulrunner packages.
