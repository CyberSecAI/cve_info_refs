- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Visual Synapse HTTP server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically URL requests containing "dot dot" sequences (/../).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can bypass directory restrictions and access files and directories outside of the intended web server root, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as system files.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request containing "dot dot" sequences within the requested path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker, no authentication required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
