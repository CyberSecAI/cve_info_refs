      "summary": "This bug report provides details about CVE-2010-3079. It describes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the ftrace functionality of the Linux kernel. The vulnerability is triggered when debugfs is mounted, and it can lead to a kernel crash, causing a denial of service. The vulnerability was found using a tool by Tavis Ormandy and reported by Robert Swiecki of Google Security Team. The issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5, or Red Hat Enterprise MRG. A patch has been merged upstream and was fixed in kernel versions 2.6.27.54, 2.6.32.22 and 2.6.35.5. It was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2010:0842. The bug report also indicates a dependency on other bugs (631624, 631625, and 631626).",
