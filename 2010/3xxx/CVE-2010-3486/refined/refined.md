  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to directory traversal due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal",
    "OS Command Injection",
     "Local File Inclusion",
    "Remote File Inclusion"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user can read and write directories and files, perform OS command injection and execution, potentially gaining control of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through crafted GET requests with directory traversal sequences within the URL path.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have at least user-level privileges to launch the attack. This can be exploited through the User Home/Public Web Directory using the host provider's SSL certificate, or directly from the host server using local or remote file inclusion."
