    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office parses specially crafted TIFF image files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens an Office document containing a specially crafted TIFF image.

Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",

       "E-mail attachment",
      "Visiting a malicious website containing a crafted document."
