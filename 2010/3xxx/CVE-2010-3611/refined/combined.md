1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- mysql
- local users could delete data files for tables of other users
(CVE-2010-1626).
- authenticated users could gather information for tables they
should not have access to (CVE-2010-1849)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-3683,
CVE-2010-3681, CVE-2010-1848)
- authenticated users could bypass intended access restrictions
(CVE-2008-7247, CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1,
openSUSE 11.2
- dhcp
ISC DHCP can be crashed with a single dhcpv6 packet.
CVE-2010-3611 has been assigned to this issue.
Additionally a dhcrelay crash when receiving packets on interfaces
without assigned IPv4 address has been fixed as well as an infinite
loop in dhcpd.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- monotone
Remote attackers could crash a monotone server via an empty argument to
the 'mtn' command (CVE-2010-4098).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moodle
This update of moodle fixes:
- CVE-2010-4207: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
charts/assets/charts.swf.
- CVE-2010-4208: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
uploader/assets/uploader.swf.
- CVE-2010-4209: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
swfstore/swfstore.swf.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- openssl/libopenssl-devel
Specially crafted responses from SSL servers could cause a double-free bug
in openssl's client implementation. Therefore a malicious SSL servers could
crash client-side code that uses the openssl library for its SSL connection.
(CVE-2010-2939: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM))
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.
