Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-3947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the way Microsoft Office parses specially crafted TIFF image files. Specifically, there's a heap overflow when processing these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap overflow in the TIFF image converter component of Microsoft Office. This occurs because the software doesn't properly handle the data while parsing the TIFF image, leading to a write beyond the allocated memory on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, potentially installing programs, viewing, changing or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gains the same rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains full administrative access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Office Documents:** The vulnerability is exploited by opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office document containing a malicious TIFF image.
*   **Email Attachments:** Attackers can send malicious Office documents as email attachments.
*   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers could host malicious Office documents on a website or compromise legitimate sites to host the exploit, tricking users into visiting them.
*   **Compromised/User-Provided Content:**  Compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content could contain specially crafted TIFF content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **No Authentication:** The attack does not require any prior authentication.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers typically need to convince a user to open the malicious document (via email, website visit etc.).

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office XP, Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Works 9.
*   The advisory from US-CERT also includes information about other vulnerabilities addressed in the same Microsoft Security Bulletin.
*   Microsoft's bulletin provides workarounds involving modifying ACLs to deny access to the vulnerable TIFF filter, which would prevent Office applications from importing TIFF images.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly known or exploited before the release of the security bulletin.

This information provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability based on the provided documents, including its causes, impacts, and methods of exploitation.
