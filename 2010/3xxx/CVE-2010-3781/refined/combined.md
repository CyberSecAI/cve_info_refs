# E.23. Release 9.0.1

> **Release Date:** 2010-10-04

This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.0.0. For
information about new features in the 9.0 major release, see
[Section E.24](release-9-0.html).

## E.23.1. Migration to Version 9.0.1

A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.0.X.

## E.23.2. Changes

* Use a separate interpreter for each calling SQL userid
  in PL/Perl and PL/Tcl (Tom Lane)

  This change prevents security problems that can be
  caused by subverting Perl or Tcl code that will be executed
  later in the same session under another SQL user identity
  (for example, within a SECURITY
  DEFINER function). Most scripting languages offer
  numerous ways that that might be done, such as redefining
  standard functions or operators called by the target
  function. Without this change, any SQL user with Perl or
  Tcl language usage rights can do essentially anything with
  the SQL privileges of the target function's owner.

  The cost of this change is that intentional
  communication among Perl and Tcl functions becomes more
  difficult. To provide an escape hatch, PL/PerlU and PL/TclU
  functions continue to use only one interpreter per session.
  This is not considered a security issue since all such
  functions execute at the trust level of a database
  superuser already.

  It is likely that third-party procedural languages that
  claim to offer trusted execution have similar security
  issues. We advise contacting the authors of any PL you are
  depending on for security-critical purposes.

  Our thanks to Tim Bunce for pointing out this issue
  (CVE-2010-3433).
* Improve `pg_get_expr()`
  security fix so that the function can still be used on the
  output of a sub-select (Tom Lane)
* Fix incorrect placement of placeholder evaluation (Tom
  Lane)

  This bug could result in query outputs being non-null
  when they should be null, in cases where the inner side of
  an outer join is a sub-select with non-strict expressions
  in its output list.
* Fix join removal's handling of placeholder expressions
  (Tom Lane)
* Fix possible duplicate scans of UNION ALL member relations (Tom Lane)
* Prevent infinite loop in ProcessIncomingNotify() after
  unlistening (Jeff Davis)
* Prevent show\_session\_authorization() from crashing
  within autovacuum processes (Tom Lane)
* Re-allow input of Julian dates prior to 0001-01-01 AD
  (Tom Lane)

  Input such as 'J100000'::date
  worked before 8.4, but was unintentionally broken by added
  error-checking.
* Make psql recognize DISCARD ALL
  as a command that should not be encased in a transaction
  block in autocommit-off mode (Itagaki Takahiro)
* Update build infrastructure and documentation to reflect
  the source code repository's move from CVS to Git (Magnus
  Hagander and others)
