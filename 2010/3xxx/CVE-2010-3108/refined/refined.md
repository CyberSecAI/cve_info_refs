  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Novell iPrint Client browser plugin. User interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious web page. The specific flaw exists within handling plugin parameters. The application does not properly verify the name of parameters passed via <embed> tags. If a malicious attacker provides a long enough value a destination buffer can be overflowed. Successful exploitation leads to execution of arbitrary code under the context of the user owning the browser process.",
  "root_cause": "The application does not properly verify the name of parameters passed via <embed> tags, leading to a buffer overflow.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper input validation",
    "Buffer overflow"
  ],
  "impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the user owning the browser process.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Malicious web page with crafted <embed> tags"
