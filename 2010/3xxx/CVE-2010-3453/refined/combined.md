CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3450 CVE-2010-3451 CVE-2010-3452 CVE-2010-3453
                 CVE-2010-3454 CVE-2010-3689 CVE-2010-4253 CVE-2010-4643

Several security related problems have been discovered in the
OpenOffice.org package that allows malformed documents to trick the
system into crashes or even the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3450

    During an internal security audit within Red Hat, a directory
    traversal vulnerability has been discovered in the way
    OpenOffice.org 3.1.1 through 3.2.1 processes XML filter files.  If
    a local user is tricked into opening a specially-crafted OOo XML
    filters package file, this problem could allow remote attackers to
    create or overwrite arbitrary files belonging to local user or,
    potentially, execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3451

    During his work as a consultant at Virtual Security Research
    (VSR), Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in
    OpenOffice.org's RTF parsing functionality.  Opening a maliciously
    crafted RTF document can caus an out-of-bounds memory read into
    previously allocated heap memory, which may lead to the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3452

    Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in the RTF file parser
    which can be leveraged by attackers to achieve arbitrary code
    execution by convincing a victim to open a maliciously crafted RTF
    file.

CVE-2010-3453

    As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg
    discovered a vulnerability in the WW8ListManager::WW8ListManager()
    function of OpenOffice.org that allows a maliciously crafted file
    to cause the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3454

    As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg
    discovered a vulnerability in the WW8DopTypography::ReadFromMem()
    function in OpenOffice.org that may be exploited by a maliciously
    crafted file which allowins an attacker to control program flow
    and potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-3689

    Dmitri Gribenko discovered that the soffice script does not treat
    an empty LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable like an unset one, may lead to
    the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-4253

    A heap based buffer overflow has been discovered with unknown impact.

CVE-2010-4643

    A vulnerability has been discovered in the way OpenOffice.org
    handles TGA graphics which can be tricked by a specially crafted
    TGA file that could cause the program to crash due to a heap-based
    buffer overflow with unknown impact.

For the stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.1+dfsg-1+lenny11.

For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) these problems have
been fixed in version 3.2.1-11+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.1-11+squeeze1.

For the experimental distribution these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.0~rc3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org packages.

### Background

OpenOffice is the open source version of StarOffice, a full office
productivity suite. LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice and
Libreoffice. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
using OpenOffice, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition, execution
of arbitrary Python code, authentication bypass, or reading and writing
of arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-3.5.5.3"

```

All LibreOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-4.2.5.2"

```

All LibreOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-4.2.5.2"

```

We recommend that users unmerge OpenOffice:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-office/openoffice"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Charlie Miller discovered several heap overflows in PPT processing. If

a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted

PPT document, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. Ubuntu 10.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2010-2935](/security/CVE-2010-2935), [CVE-2010-2936](/security/CVE-2010-2936))

Marc Schoenefeld discovered that directory traversal was not correctly

handled in XSLT, OXT, JAR, or ZIP files. If a user or automated system

were tricked into opening a specially crafted document, a remote attacker

overwrite arbitrary files, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution

with user privileges. ([CVE-2010-3450](/security/CVE-2010-3450))

Dan Rosenberg discovered multiple heap overflows in RTF and DOC

processing. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted RTF or DOC document, a remote attacker could execute

arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2010-3451](/security/CVE-2010-3451), [CVE-2010-3452](/security/CVE-2010-3452),

[CVE-2010-3453](/security/CVE-2010-3453), [CVE-2010-3454](/security/CVE-2010-3454))

Dmitri Gribenko discovered that OpenOffice.org did not correctly

handle LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH in various tools. If a local attacker

tricked a user or automated system into using OpenOffice.org from an

attacker-controlled directory, they could execute arbitrary code with

user privileges. ([CVE-2010-3689](/security/CVE-2010-3689))

Marc Schoenefeld discovered that OpenOffice.org did not correctly process

PNG images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted document, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary

code with user privileges. ([CVE-2010-4253](/security/CVE-2010-4253))

It was discovered that OpenOffice.org did not correctly process TGA

images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted document, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary

code with user privileges. ([CVE-2010-4643](/security/CVE-2010-4643))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=640950#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2010-10-07 10:25:10 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way OpenOffice.org imported Microsoft Word Binary File Format (.DOC) files with certain user defined list styles (WW8). If a user opened a specially-crafted DOC file in OpenOffice.org suite tool (oowriter), it could lead to denial of service (oowriter executable crash), or possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user  running OpenOffice.org Writer.    References: [1] <http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/drosenbe/research.html>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank OpenOffice.org for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Dan Rosenberg of Virtual Security Research as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=640950#c9)  Huzaifa S.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2011verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1291877.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1291877.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for your releases.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1291877.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1291877.1) for further details regarding the On Request patches.
