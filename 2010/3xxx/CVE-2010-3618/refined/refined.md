  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The PGP Desktop user interface incorrectly displays messages with unsigned data as signed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsigned data injection",
      "Incorrect display of signed messages"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can add a message part (attachment) to a valid, signed PGP message, and the entire message, including the attacker's part, is reported as having a valid signature. This allows the attacker to inject malicious content without the recipient being aware of it, as the UI does not distinguish between signed and unsigned parts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulated PGP messages"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create and append unsigned data to an existing signed PGP message. The attacker requires no special position relative to the target, other than the ability to transmit or deliver the manipulated PGP message."
