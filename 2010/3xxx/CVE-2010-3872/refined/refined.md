{
  "CVE-2010-3872": {
    "Root cause": "The `fcgid_header_bucket_read` function in `fcgid_bucket.c` does not use bytewise pointer arithmetic in certain circumstances.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malformed FastCGI response can cause a stack-based buffer overflow, leading to application crash. Potentially allows for arbitrary code execution as the user running the web server.",
    "Attack vectors": "Untrusted FastCGI applications can send a malformed response to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or influence the FastCGI application and its response to the server."
