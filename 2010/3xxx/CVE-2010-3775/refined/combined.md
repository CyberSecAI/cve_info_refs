|  | |

The Java security policy may be bypassed when LiveConnect script is loaded via a "data:" URL using a META Refresh.
The basic construct would appear as:
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0,data:text/html,<html><body><script>alert(self.java);</script></body></html>">
This script will run with under a security policy of "moz-nullprincipal:{xxxx-xxxx-xxxx}". It appears that the plugin logic may not be correctly accounting for this.
The severity of this issue seems highly dependent on browser, JRE version, plugin and platform.
Tested with Apple Java (MRJ/JEP plugin):
Firefox 3.6 - Mac OS X: read files, connect sockets, execute programs
Firefox 3.5 - Mac OS X: read files, connect sockets, execute programs
Tested using Oracle/Sun JavaSE:
Firefox 3.6 - Windows - JRE 1.6: crash JVM
Firefox 3.5 - Windows - JRE 1.6: crash JVM
Firefox 3.5 - Windows - JRE 1.5: read files
Firefox 3.6 - Linux - JRE 1.6: crash JVM
Firefox 3.5 - Linux - JRE 1.6: read files
Firefox 3.5 - Linux - JRE 1.5: read files
Tested with OpenJDK:
Firefox 3.6 - Linux - IcedTea6: no bypasses observed
Note: also tested with latest nightly (20100819) 3.6 and 3.5 builds with same results.

I'm kind of OK with crashing the JVM on Windows and Linux, or at least I'm more
concerned about Mac. Stephen: can we catch this in the JEP before handing it
off to Apple's JVM?

I've confirmed this on both OS X 10.5.8 and OS X 10.6.4 :-(
Now to find out whose fault it is, and what I might be able to do
about it.
One consolation (for me) is that the new JEP that I'm currently
working on deals correctly with all these testcases -- it catches all
the security violations and aborts the offending JavaScript command.
Nothing crashes -- the browser or the JVM. But the new JEP isn't
going to be ready soon enough (for a general release) to deal with
this problem.

In other words, the script's subject principal (an nsIPrincipal
object) has its 'origin' set to "moz-nullprincipal:{xxxx-xxxx-xxxx}".
> Now to find out whose fault it is, and what I might be able to do
> about it.
This appears to be a Mozilla bug. The doc on nsIPrincipal's origin
attribute (in nsIPrincipal.idl) says:
The origin of this principal's codebase URI.
An origin is defined as: scheme + host + port.
This contract is violated by setting the origin to
"moz-nullprincipal:{xxxx-xxxx-xxxx}".
But the JEP's behavior when encountering an ill-formed origin is also
rather buggy: It assumes that an nsIPrincipal object with an
ill-formed origin (or no origin at all) is the system principal.
It'd be easy enough for me to change the JEP so that it refuses to do
JavaScript-to-Java Liveconnect whenever it encounters an ill-formed
origin (one that isn't a plain-vanilla URL -- one that causes the Java
URL(String) constructor to choke). This would mean that non-applet
JavaScript-to-Java Liveconnect never runs with special privileges.
But that's probably how things should be (and how they already are in
the "new JEP" -- which will eventually become JEP 0.9.8, or possibly
1.0).
I should be able to create and test a new version (JEP 0.9.7.4) in the
next few days -- one whose only change is what I described in the
previous paragraph. But it's probably best to postpone its formal
release (its availability at <http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/>) until
new versions of FF are released (3.6.10 and 3.5.13) that bundle JEP
0.9.7.4.
What do people think about this?

It'd also mean that JavaScript-to-Java Liveconnect wouldn't work \*at
all\* when the current script's subject principal had a
wierd/ill-formed origin. My feeling is that this would be no great
loss. But others may think/know differently.

By the way, "liveconnect" here means the old browser-side Liveconnect
support in Mozilla, which together with the old OJI support allowed
Sun's old OJI plugin to do Java. It doesn't refer to Liveconnect in
general, which is still supported (on the trunk and branches) using
npruntime (and Sun/Oracle's new Java Plugin2 plugin).
That said, I believe this is correct. I've only seen the exploits
work with the JEP on OS X (which currently uses both OJI and
browser-side Liveconnect). I only see the error message "No Java? No
LiveConnect?" running this bug's testcases on Windows XP and Linux
with Sun/Oracle's Java 6, using any current version of FF (FF 3.5.X,
FF 3.6.X, FF 4pre -- all of which use Java Plugin2 on Windows and
Linux, via npruntime, when it's available)
Gregory, can you explain why I don't see any crashes on Windows or
Linux?

part of the confusion here is that inside Mozilla "LiveConnect" refers to a particular technology, that has now been replaced. Outside Mozilla "LiveConnect" means "running Java without an <applet>" -- a feature now supported in multiple browsers.

Actually, the most common usage of "LiveConnect" refers to
communication between Java and JavaScript. There are two kinds --
JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect and Java-to-JavaScript LiveConnect.
And there are two kinds of JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect -- one that
scripts a Java applet (calls its methods or accesses its fields), and
another that directly creates Java objects and scripts them (calls
their methods or accesses their fields). Only the latter is "running
Java without an <applet>".

Don't know.
Here is what I observed:
1) open site that loads Java applet
2) in another tab, run test case code
3) original Java applet no longer functions
For example,
1) open <http://nist.time.gov/timezone.cgi?UTC/s/0/java>
- should start Java applet with time
2) in another tab, run test case
3) return to original tab, Java applet no longer functions
The same can be observed if the Java console is launched prior to running test cases.
On Windows with Java tracing & logging turned on, the last message trace is something like:
JVM heartbeat .. Exception, send ts: 363387102831, now ts: 363397104819, dT 10001988

OK, now I see what you mean. Thanks!!
I was naively looking for the browser to crash. But it's only the
"client" process of Java Plugin2 that crashes. (Testing on Windows,
this happed in FF 3.6.8 and today's Minefield nightly.)
But I have no idea \*why\* Java Plugin2 crashes.
I looked through fairly recent source code for Java Plugin2, and
couldn't find any place where it tries to get an nsIPrincipal object
from the browser.
There \*is\* code in Java Plugin2 to use XPCOM to get proxy information,
to get and set cookies, and to get auth information for a page that
uses basic HTTP auth. But it's only used if the browser doesn't
support NPAPI calls that provide the same information. And FF has
supported all these NPAPI calls since FF 3.5.
So this bug's testcase \*does\* effect FF4pre on Windows and Linux. But
it's not at all clear we're seeing the same bug on Windows and Linux
as we are on OS X.

Attached file
[Testcases loaded "normally" (not via META Refresh "data:" URL)](attachment.cgi?id=469495)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=469495&action=edit)

Here's Gregory's set of testcases, altered to load each testcase
"normally". It has no problems in either FF+JEP (on OS X) or
FF+Java-Plugin2 (on Windows, Linux and OS X) -- all access violations
are caught (and aborted), and there are no crashes.
> This script will run with under a security policy of

This is certainly true with FF+JEP. But I can't believe it explains
the Java client process crashes with Java Plugin2 -- I can find no way
that the "security policy" gets passed to Java Plugin2.
I'm also pretty sure the Java Plugin2 client process crashes are
entirely the fault of Java Plugin2 -- the new JEP (what will become
JEP 0.9.8 or 1.0), which also uses NPAPI and npruntime, has no
problems with the original testcase in any current version of FF.
So this bug appears to really be two different bugs:
1) A security hole in FF+JEP (on OS X) that is partly a bug in the
browser and partly a bug in the JEP.
2) A crash bug in Java Plugin2, which only happens in browsers that
support LiveConnect without applets.

Not having received any responses to my question, I went ahead and
created a JEP 0.9.7.4 -- though (as promised) I haven't yet released
it.
It works around this bug, and also makes two other very small changes
to fix annoying problems. I've tested all my changes -- but, as I
said, they didn't require much testing, because they're so small.

I ended up with a slightly different fix. JEP 0.9.7.4 refuses to do
JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect whenever it encounters a subject
principal \*other than the system principal\* with an ill-formed origin.
Since there's an nsIScriptSecurityManager::GetSystemPrincipal()
method, it's easy to check if the current script's principal is the
system principal, and if so let the JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect
call proceed with enhanced privileges.
I could probably release JEP 0.9.7.4 without letting the cat out of
the bag. My code changes (and comments) don't give any description of
the attack vector -- any more so than do the comments I've made in
this bug. I suspect even a knowledgeable person would have difficulty
constructing an attack, knowing only (for example) what I said in the
previous paragraph -- though Gregory may be able to correct me on
this.
But even so, it's better to be cautious. So I'm not going to release
JEP 0.9.7.4 until I hear from people like Dan Veditz.
This will be inconvenient for testers: The JEP 0.9.7.4 distro is
probably too large to post here, and I don't have anywhere else to
post it that isn't publicly accessible.
I'll be in Mountain View next week, and will leave copies there for
people to test with. But that doesn't take care of all interested
parties. Gregory, would you like me to email you a copy? The distro
(a zip file) is about 4MB.

See particularly [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL") and [comment #17](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL").
It's my conclusion, based on what evidence I can find, that the
crashes in Java Plugin2's client process are unrelated to the security
problem in OJI and the JEP on OS X. But I'm not sure I've covered all
the bases WRT these crashes -- in large part because I don't really
have the tools to debug crashes in other processes than the browser's
main process, particularly on Windows and Linux.
If someone (you or someone else) can do this sort of testing, and
therefore go beyond what I've already done, that would be very useful.

I wasn't able to reproduce any of the security problems you reported
using Sun's Java Plugin2 and recent releases of FF 3.5.X (the client
process always just crashed).
Note that we're not interested in results using OJI and older versions
of Sun's Java Plugin on platforms other than OS X (e.g. Windows and
Linux): As far as I know, all current versions of Firefox (FF 3.5.X
and up) refuse to use the old Sun OJI plugin on platforms other than
OS X.
If I'm wrong about FF 3.5 (in other words if I'm wrong that current
releases of FF 3.5 refuse to use the old Sun OJI plugin on Windows and
Linux), someone please speak up!!

I found a Windows system with J2SE 5.0 Update 17 on which I could
test, and it turns out I \*am\* wrong -- on it, using FF 3.5.13, the
first of Gregory's testcases "works" (it's able to read the contents
of C:\BOOT.INI). (FF 3.6.10 does refuse to use J2SE 5.0.)
So this bug \*isn't\* fixed on the 1.9.1 branch (in FF 3.5.X) except on
the Mac.
I suggest we fix this by backporting the code that stops FF 3.6 and
above from using Sun's old OJI Java plugin (that only uses Java
Plugin2). I'm not familiar with that code, so someone else will need
to take care of this.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDResolution: FIXED → ---

Looks like this will likely slip out of 1.9.1.14 then. dveditz, is it ok fixing this on 1.9.2.11 and not disclosing until it is 100% fixed on 1.9.1?

This is puzzling, and I'm not able to reproduce your security
violation (reading any user-accessible file) on a Ubuntu Linux 9.10
installation with Sun Java 1.6.0\_20 and FF 3.5.12.
Please double-check that FF really is using Java 6 by visiting the
following site:
<http://browserspy.dk/java.php>
Then if it is, please also do the following:
1) Run FF 3.5.X and load at least one Java applet (for example the
ones at <http://browserspy.dk/java.php>).
2) Use "ps ax | grep firefox" to find Firefox's process id.
3) Run gdb and attach to the Firefox process by entering "gdb Firefox
[firefox-pid]".
4) In gdb (at the "(gdb)" prompt) enter "info sharedlibrary".
Look through the list for either "libnpjp2.so" (which is the main
component of Java Plugin2) or "libjavaplugin\_oji.so" (which is the
main component of the old OJI plugin).
Which do you find?

(Following up [comment #31](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041#c31 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL"))
Another question:
If (as I expect) you find that you're using libjavaplugin\_oji.so (the
old OJI plugin) in Java 6, please also check that libnpjp2.so exists
somewhere in your Java 6 installation. One way to do this is to "cd"
to the top level of your Java 6 installation and enter "find . -name
libnpjp2.so". Also check which of these two plugins is available in
your Firefox distro's "plugins" directory.
It's my understanding that, since at least FF 3.5, Firefox always
prefers Java Plugin2 over the old OJI plugin where both are available.
But (once again) I could be wrong about this.
Another, easier way to tell which Java plugin you're using:
Go to "about:plugins" and see which plugin binary is listed under
"File name" -- libjavaplugin\_oji.so or libnpjp2.so.

And still more information:
I just found out that, on the Linux system where I've been testing
(which is Ubuntu 9.04, not 9.10 as I mentioned earlier), there's a
"/etc/alternatives/javaplugin.so" soft link that tells Firefox which
Java plugin to use (and which points to libnpjp2.so on my system).
As an experiment, I tried putting soft links to both plugins in a FF
3.5.X distro's "plugins" directory. Both show up in about:plugins,
and gdb shows that both binaries get loaded. But I'm unable to read
arbitrary user files using that distro -- which indicates I may be
right about FF 3.5.X always preferring Java Plugin2 when both it and
the old OJI plugin are present.

It now looks like we need both to blocklist versions of the Java
plugin older than Java SE 6 Update 14 (as [bug 497423](/show_bug.cgi?id=497423 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - [1.9.2+] blocklist all versions of the Java plugin prior to Java SE 6 Update 14") does on platforms

Unix-like OSes).

We probably can't simply refuse to use older java on the older branch. We need to see if we can avoid instantiating Java with a principal that it's going to misunderstand. In other words, a scheme whitelist.

Actually this \*is\* still fixed on the 1.9.2 branch:
The problem only happens with the old OJI plugin, and the 1.9.2 branch
no longer supports OJI except on the Mac -- where this bug has been
fixed by JEP 0.9.7.4.

But it's true that the crash bug (with Java Plugin2) happens also on
the 1.9.2 branch (FF 3.6.X) and the trunk (FF 4 and above). And it
might be possible to fix both the crash bug (on FF 3.6 and up) and the
security hole (on FF 3.5.X) by avoiding using "malformed principals"
in scripts that use Java.

Yes, in my test reproducing the problem, I was explicitly using libjavaplugin\_oji.so plugin that was symlinked into the distro "plugins" sub-directory. The /etc/alternatives version was deleted.
When libnpjp2.so is also symlinked into "plugins" directory, then it is used in preference to the older version. In this case, the crash behavior is observed.

As best I can tell, it isn't a security hole on either the trunk or
the 1.9.2 branch -- where FF (on other platforms than OS X) can no
longer use the old OJI Java plugin.

So [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL") scares me a lot. "moz-nullprincipal:{xxxx-xxxx-xxxx}" is returned very much by design, if anything the docs here are outdated/poorly written.
Are we still granting such principals system privileges in the JEP? If so that needs to be fixed.
Should a new bug be filed on this? It seems like this bug as it is covers multiple issues, both the principal one and some sort of related crash. Would be great to only have one issue per bug.

Not as of JEP 0.9.7.4, which has now been landed on all the live branches (see [bug 598453](/show_bug.cgi?id=598453 "RESOLVED FIXED - New version of JEP (0.9.7.4), please land on branches")).
Note that, as best I can tell, the security problem (the granting of system privileges to "malformed" principals) only exists when using OJI.

I think we need a quick summary of the remaining security problems that need to be resolved here. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I understand from reading the comments here...
Ignoring any crashes that aren't known to be exploitable for now... OJI-based Java plugins can cause users to become vulnerable. Firefox trunk is safe because it has no OJI support on any platform. Firefox 3.6 is now safe because there is no OJI support for Windows and Linux and JEP for Mac OS X has been patched. Firefox 3.5 remains vulnerable because it can load vulnerable OJI-based Java plugins on all platforms.
So we need a fix for Firefox 3.5.x and the current proposals are 1) block vulnerable plugins 2) Avoid instantiating Java with a principal that is going to misunderstand (a scheme whitelist). Either way we should probably update the 3.5.x JEP.
Is this correct?

Firefox 3.5 isn't vulnerable on OS X, because it also bundles the patched JEP.

Thanks Josh and Steven for the summary (This is why one-problem-per-bug is critical for security bugs).
As for the two options, I think it's fine to block based on scheme. null-principal documents rarely happen on the web, so making java not work on them should not cause any sites to break.

Here's where I think we're at with this bug: The JEP issue is fixed, which I think was the main issue that was dealt with in this bug. The remaining issues are:
1: Whitelist URL schemes that modern Java plugins are able to deal with and only let the Java plugin do live-connect functionality on such URLs.
2: Figure out what to do with actual live-connect code, i.e. Firefox 3.5.
AFAICT [bug 594443](/show_bug.cgi?id=594443 "RESOLVED WONTFIX") covers issue 1, and I think we should file a separate bug on the issue with the old live-connect code in Firefox 3.5.

This is no longer true -- I discovered some interesting things working
on [bug 610525](/show_bug.cgi?id=610525 "RESOLVED FIXED - JavaScript-to-Java (nsISecureEnv) calls sometimes made with no JavaScript on stack").
I've got a 1.9.1-branch patch that fixes this bug (the security hole)
for the OJI plugin (tested on Linux). I should shortly have a trunk
patch that fixes this bug (the plugin crash) for Java Plugin2. Both
use the URL scheme whitelist strategy.
I'll open a new bug for each of these patches, and post their numbers
here.

has been bundled on the branches since 2010-09-24 (see bug 5908453
[comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL") and following).
So to reproduce this bug you need to use builds (nightlies or
otherwise) from before 2010-09-25. To see this bug in an OS X
release, you must test with FF 3.6.10 or earlier, or FF 3.5.13 or
earlier.

Filed a bug within Oracle to make sure Java VM running the applet won't exit on that exception.

(In reply to [comment #61](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041#c61 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL"))
By "that exception", I assume you mean the RuntimeException mentioned
in [bug 611910 comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=611910#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to NPRuntime Java plugins that Java can understand").

Or rather the MalformedURLException that triggers the
RuntimeException.

| [Comment 64](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041#c64)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

I should have be more precise. The RuntimeException should not exit the VM, and we should probably not even throw it. The MalformdURLException is expected based on the input from the test case.

This bug was spun off from [bug 589041](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL"), to fix that bug for OJI
plugins.
OJI uses the current script principal's origin to configure the
privileges of Java code that's called (via the nsISecureEnv interface)
from JavaScript code (aka JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect).
As the testcase from [bug 589041](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL") shows, if the script principal's
origin is a malformed URL (or one that Java can't understand),
JavaScript-to-Java calls will run with abnormally high privileges:
Specifically, it will be allowed to read any file.
This happens in the following method in SecureInvocation.java (part of
the source distro for Sun/Oracle JDKs going back to Java 1.4.2):
private static ProtectionDomain
getDefaultProtectionDomain(String urlString, boolean direct)
This method tries to construct a URL object from the urlString
parameter, using the URL(String) constructor. If the constructor
fails with a MalformedURLException, the 'url' variable gets set to
'null'. Then if 'url' is 'null' or its scheme/protocol is 'file', the
following permission is added to the PermissionCollection object from
which a ProtectionDomain will be created:
FilePermission("<<ALL FILES>>", "read")
The 'urlString' value passed to getDefaultProtectionDomain()
ultimately comes from a call to nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin() in
Mozilla OJI code.
In my next comment I'll post a patch that changes this method to only
return an 'origin' that Java will understand -- that won't cause the
URL(String) constructor to throw a MalformedURLException.

As promised in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=611897#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to the OJI plugin that Java can understand"), my patch changes the
nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin() method to only return an 'origin' that
Java will understand.
If the "original" origin isn't a proper URL, or if its scheme isn't in
the small lists of schemes/protocols that Java understands, it returns
a "fake" URL with the "http" scheme and a random hostname ending in an
invalid TLD (currently ".xyz"). The idea is to return a URL that
won't make the URL(String) constructor choke, but which also won't
cause any usable network privileges to be granted.Assignee: nobody → smichaudStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

I'd like to post a Linux test build made with my patch from [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=611897#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to the OJI plugin that Java can understand"), plus some debug logging. But wierdness in my current Linux build configuration prevents me from doing that. Hopefully I'll find a way around it next week.
(As of a few months ago, the tryservers are only available do to trunk builds.)

Please set the TLD to "invalid" instead, since that's actually guaranteed to never be a working TLD?

Why not just return an error, "no java for you!"?
If returning an error doesn't stop java execution then I worry about the error return further down if origin is null. What happens then?

> Why not just return an error, "no java for you!"?
Then you may break Java in unexpected ways, like what happened when I
did the same kind of thing in JEP 0.9.7.4's workaround for [bug 589041](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL"),
and triggered [bug 606737](/show_bug.cgi?id=606737 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java Applet: JSObject.getWindow(this) returns null") and [bug 607678](/show_bug.cgi?id=607678 "RESOLVED FIXED - JEP 0.9.7.4 breaks (Yahoo! games, pogo.com) applets that attempt to open new windows in pop-up windows").
I thought we'd agreed on a URL scheme whitelist ([bug 589041](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL") comment
#50).
> If returning an error doesn't stop java execution then I worry about

I don't understand what you're saying. With my current patch, a null
origin gets replaced by a fake URL that Java can understand, but can't
use to access the network.

Oops, that's wrong.
nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin() does an error return if it finds a
NULL origin. And now I see this is what you're referring to.
I'll look into what happens when nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin() does
an error return.

Attached patch

[Fix rev1 (fix various problems)](attachment.cgi?id=490915&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=490915&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=611897&attachment=490915)

> I'll look into what happens when nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin()
> does an error return.
Since my patch for [bug 610525](/show_bug.cgi?id=610525 "RESOLVED FIXED - JavaScript-to-Java (nsISecureEnv) calls sometimes made with no JavaScript on stack") landed, I don't think it's any longer
possible that nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin() will fail to find an
origin while doing JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect.
But there's only one place this method is called (from
getAndPackSecurityInfo() in the OJI plugin's remotejni.cpp), and the
caller doesn't check for an error return. So I've bullet-proofed
nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin() as much as possible. And I now call
it from browser-side OJI code, just before every possible
JavaScript-to-Java call, and abort the call if (by some very unlikely
chance) nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin() does an error return.
We really shouldn't say "no Java for you" unless absolutely necessary
-- we're usually deep inside plugin code, and it's hard to predict
what Java will do when we start breaking things. I wish I'd thought
of my fake URL solution when I was doing my workaround for [bug 589041](/show_bug.cgi?id=589041 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via META Refresh \"data:\" URL")
in JEP 0.9.7.4 -- it would have been much less disruptive.
I've also followed Boris' suggestion from [bug 611910 comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=611910#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to NPRuntime Java plugins that Java can understand") and
[bug 611910 comment #6](/show_bug.cgi?id=611910#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to NPRuntime Java plugins that Java can understand") to put some of my patch into nsNetUtil.h where
it can be shared (for example by my patch for [bug 611910](/show_bug.cgi?id=611910 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to NPRuntime Java plugins that Java can understand")).
Note that this patch (like the previous one) is on the 1.9.1 branch.
The OJI plugin's getAndPackSecurityInfo() calls
nsCSecurityContext::GetOrigin() with a 256-byte stack buffer -- which
is why I do the same thing from ProxyJNIEnv's various methods.

I've already found one mistake:
I need to add the following line to nsNetUtil.h. Windows builds fail without it:

If we're actually going for unique hostnames, shouldn't we do something better than rand() seeded with a known value that doesn't update very often?

If you have a better idea, please suggest it. I'm not an expert on
this.

I think it would make more sense to generate a UUID as the hostname. See the code in nsNullPrincipal::Init. You'll want to strip the '{' and '}' chars off the string ToProvidedString creates, but other than that it should work.

Attached patch

[Fix rev2 (follow Boris' suggestion, sort of)](attachment.cgi?id=491046&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=491046&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=611897&attachment=491046)

This patch makes NS\_MakeRandomInvalidURLString() optionally use
nsIUUIDGenerator to generate a UUID for the hostname, and falls back
to using NS\_MakeRandomString().
The fallback is needed if nsIUUIDGenerator fails. But I also
discovered that using nsIUUIDGenerator is a significant performance
hit if it's called at all often (as it is by the OJI plugin and my
current OJI patch). Possibly it's using a randomness provider that
blocks until sufficient randomness is available (I tested on Linux).
So I've made my OJI patch (this bug's patch) tell
NS\_MakeRandomInvalidURLString() to always use NS\_MakeRandomString().
Since the OJI plugin is obsolete and seldom used on Windows or Linux,
I figure this isn't a great loss.
My new patch for [bug 611910](/show_bug.cgi?id=611910 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to NPRuntime Java plugins that Java can understand") tells NS\_MakeRandomInvalidURLString() to
use nsIUUIDGenerator.

OK, so I feel like I'm missing something.
Do we actually need unique/unguessable return values for what Java needs here security-wise? If that's the case, why are not particularly guessable but pretty guessable ones ok? If not, why not just use a constant string?

Attached patch

[Fix rev3 (deal better with performance hit)](attachment.cgi?id=491578&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=491578&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=611897&attachment=491578)

Here's a new patch that does a better job of dealing with the
performance hit I mentioned in [comment #18](/show_bug.cgi?id=611897#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to the OJI plugin that Java can understand").
Turns out this isn't caused by a randomness provider, or by any
Mozilla code. Instead it seems to be a subtle problem with the pipe
that the OJI plugin uses to pass information from JavaScript code
running on the main thread to Java code running on secondary threads.
Somehow, rapidly changing the "origin" causes a dramatic slowdown in
the operation of this pipe.
So if we need to use a fake origin, my new patch dramatically reduces
the frequency with which that fake origin is changed. This doesn't
open a security hole: Some of Java's same-origin checks may now pass
that would fail it the fake origin changed more often. But
same-origin checks are only used to grant (or deny) network access,
and none of the fake origins (which are invalid URLs) can be used to
access the network.
My new patch also changes NS\_MakeRandomString() in nsNetUtil.h.
Turns out the only reason I didn't see the above-mentioned performance
hit when using NS\_MakeRandomString() is that it only changed the seed
(passed to srandom()) every second -- so that frequent calls would
return the same "random" string.
A comment in the previous code claims the granularity of PR\_Now() on
"the Mac" is one second. But this was only true of Mac Carbon code,
which has been gone since FF 2.0 days. So my code now assumes that
PR\_Now() has millisecond granularity -- which (judging by the
"milliseconds since epoch" comment) was the original intention all
along.

This would be visible in our source code, and hence easily guessable.
I think my new patch is a better solution.

We don't need unique return values, and we may not need unguessable
ones -- presuming I'm right about Java only using same-origin checks
to grant or deny network access.
Somehow, though, I feel more comfortable with what my current patch
does.

OK, thanks for explaining.
1) If we fail to get the UUID generator service, I think we should just throw
an exception or equivalent. That should not be happening.
2) I'd prefer not hardcoding "36" when we have a perfectly good NSID\_LENGTH
lying around that we can use (with a few subtracted obviously).
3) Are there plans to use NS\_CheckIsJavaCompatibleURLString anywhere other
than this code?
4) PR\_Now on modern Mac has microsecond granularity as far as I can tell, but
given that I don't think we need NS\_MakeRandomString at all (see item 1), I
think that's not relevant.
5) GetFakeOrigin should return |const nsCString&| and be a const method,
right?

In both this bug's patch and my patch for [bug 611010](/show_bug.cgi?id=611010 "VERIFIED FIXED - type:None is getting into download urls"), we very much
want to avoid saying "no Java for you", if at all possible. And my
changes substantially improve NS\_MakeRandomString(). So I'd really
prefer to keep falling back to it.
> 2) I'd prefer not hardcoding "36" when we have a perfectly good

OK, I'll use 'NSID\_LENGTH - 3'. The reason I used '36' is that
NSID\_LENGTH (at 39) is (currently) one longer than the length of a
UUID (presumably to account for null termination), and I was a bit
worried this might change (while the actual length of a UUID is
extremely unlike to change).
But yes, it's always better to use a macro for this kind of value. So
I'll do that.
> 3) Are there plans to use NS\_CheckIsJavaCompatibleURLString anywhere
> other than this code?
Yes. It's already used by my patch for [bug 611910](/show_bug.cgi?id=611910 "RESOLVED FIXED - Only pass URL schemes to NPRuntime Java plugins that Java can understand"). And I suspect
we'll want to use it in a patch for [bug 594443](/show_bug.cgi?id=594443 "RESOLVED WONTFIX").

Look, if the UUID service is not present, then nsDocument objects can't be instantiated at all. So either the browser won't start, or you're so deep inside XPCOM shutdown that the component is not longer being handed out by the service manager. In either case, no java seems perfectly fine to me.

Attached patch

[Fix rev5 (fix potential security hole in previous patch)](attachment.cgi?id=491669&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=491669&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=611897&attachment=491669)

My previous patch opened a potential security hole:
It would have made a single nsCSecurityContext object persist for the
entire life of a ProxyJNIEnv object. One ProxyJNIEnv object is
(potentially) created for every thread. But JavaScript-to-Java calls
are always made on the main thread -- so they're always made from the
same ProxyJNIEnv object.
As I said above, I don't think it's a problem for the same fake origin
to be used for every call from a ProxyJNIEnv object. But the
nsCSecurityContext object encapsulates additional security
information, which it \*would\* (potentially) be a problem to share
between different instances of the OJI plugin. (I say "potentially"
because we're talking about non-applet security, and I'm not sure it's
possible to legitimately make non-applet JavaScript-to-Java calls with
enhanced privileges.)
My new patch takes care of this by only making a fake origin persist
for the life of a ProxyJNIEnv object.

In fact it comes from the previous version of my patch -- where I
noticed the leak. Since mContext is initialized to NULL, I'm pretty
sure it won't cause any trouble.

This strayed from my debug patch. I'll get rid of it on landing.

Drive-by, but:

should be '\0' instead, no?
And ideally we would just output into an nsCString, not a fixed-size buffer. But whatever; this is not that important.

On second thought, though, it may be better to leave sleeping dogs
lie. So if I land this patch tonight, I'll leave out the call to
NS\_IF\_RELEASE(mContext) from the ProxyJNIEnv destructor.

Fix rev5 (fix potential security hole in previous patch)
Landed on the 1.9.1 branch with jst's and bzbarsky's fixes:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/05202664ed20>
I decided not to wait for dveditz' review. If he has any suggestions, he can make them later.

NU stands for NetUtil.
NS is fine, though, and that's what's in the final patch.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

firefox security update (RHSA-2010-0966)

Original Release Date: January 7, 2011

Last Revised: March 5, 2012

Number: ASA-2011-002

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-3766](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3766.html), [CVE-2010-3767](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3767.html), [CVE-2010-3772](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3772.html), [CVE-2010-3776](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3776.html) and [CVE-2010-3777](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3777.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JavaScript. A website
with an object containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox to
execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3771](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3771.html) to this issue.

This update adds support for the Sanitiser for OpenType (OTS) library to
Firefox. This library helps prevent potential exploits in malformed
OpenType fonts by verifying the font file prior to use. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3768](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3768.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox loaded Java LiveConnect scripts.
Malicious web content could load a Java LiveConnect script in a way that
would result in the plug-in object having elevated privileges, allowing it
to execute Java code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3775](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3775.html) to this issue.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2010-0179 was incomplete when the Firebug
add-on was used. If a user visited a website containing malicious
JavaScript while the Firebug add-on was enabled, it could cause Firefox to
execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3773](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3773.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox presented the location bar to users. A
malicious website could trick a user into thinking they are visiting the
site reported by the location bar, when the page is actually content
controlled by an attacker. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3774](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3774.html) to this issue.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Firefox x-mac-arabic,
x-mac-farsi, and x-mac-hebrew character encodings. Certain characters were
converted to angle brackets when displayed. If server-side script filtering
missed these cases, it could result in Firefox executing JavaScript code
with the permissions of a different website. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3770](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3770.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0966.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Server 1000:  * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | 7.0, 7.5 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | 2.0.x | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya IQ | 4.2, 5.0, 5.1 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |
| Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 thru 5.2 SP3 | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2 SP4 or later. |
| Avaya Message Storage Server | 4.x, 5.0.x, 5.1.x, 5.2 through 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to Message Storage Server 5.2.10 or later. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |
| Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.2 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for the listed affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-3766 CVE-2010-3767 CVE-2010-3768 CVE-2010-3770 CVE-2010-3771 CVE-2010-3772 CVE-2010-3773 CVE-2010-3774 CVE-2010-3775 CVE-2010-3776 CVE-2010-3777 | The risk level is None for CS 1000, IQ, Presence Services, Session Manager, and System Manager because they have xulrunner installed, but not Firefox. Therefore, these CVEs are not exploitable on these products. The risk level is Low for Messaging Storage Server, Message Networking, and IALX because they have the Firefox browser installed, but it is only intended for system management on these products. It's not intended that the browser be used for public Internet browsing, which would constitute non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=610525#c0)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

This is a problem in OJI and browser-side LiveConnect, which is
present on the current live branches (1.9.2 and 1.9.1), but no longer
on the trunk.
First some background:
nsISecureEnv is an interface implemented by OJI plugins to allow calls
to be made from JavaScript to Java (JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect
calls). OJI plugins (both Sun's and the JEP before version 0.9.7.4)
assume that nsISecureEnv calls will always be made with JavaScript on
the stack, because they use the current script principal's origin to
configure the Java code's security environment.
(The JEP uses nsIScriptSecurityManager::GetSubjectPrincipal() to get
the current script's principal, then calls nsIPrincipal::GetOrigin()
to get its origin.)
If by some chance there is no current script principal (if there is no
JavaScript on the stack), the JEP before version 0.9.7.4 assumed that
the Java code being called via the nsISecureEnv interface should run
with unlimited privileges. And I suspect even the most recent
versions of Sun's OJI plugin for Windows and Linux also make this
assumption.
nsISecureEnv methods (used for JavaScript-to-Java calls) are normally
called with JavaScript on the stack. But there's a bug in the
implementation of the nsILiveconnect API (used for Java-to-JavaScript
calls) that can cause nsISecureEnv methods to inadvertently be called
without any JavaScript on the stack.
That's this bug -- which I'll explain in more detail in my next
comment.
So this bug is potentially a security hole. But (as I'll also explain
in a later comment) I strongly doubt there's any way to exploit it.

Attached patch

[Fix](attachment.cgi?id=489033&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=489033&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=610525&attachment=489033)

Java-to-JavaScript calls (made using the nsILiveconnect API) can be
made "spontaneously" -- from Java code that wasn't called from
JavaScript code, and therefore when there is no JavaScript on the
stack.
To get around this, nsCLiveconnect.cpp's implementations of the
nsILiveconnect methods create an AutoPushJSContext object. This
object's constructor checks for JavaScript on the stack, and if none
is found fakes it (by adding a dummy frame with a principal to the
stack).
The AutoPushJSContext constructor takes a JSContext parameter.
Normally we only learn after a call to jsj\_enter\_js() which JSContext
we need to use. But the first time jsj\_enter\_js() is called, it
initializes a bunch of Java classes, which requires the use of
nsISecureEnv (JavaScript-to-Java) methods. And if this first call to
jsj\_enter\_js() happens during an nsILiveconnect (Java-to-JavaScript)
call, there will be no JavaScript on the stack.
My patch gets around this problem by creating the AutoPushJSContext
object before the call to jsj\_enter\_js(). It uses a new function
(JSContextForPluginInstance()) to find out which JSContext will be
returned by jsj\_enter\_js(), and passes this to the AutoPushJSContext
constructor.Assignee: nobody → smichaudStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

I've confirmed this bug's security hole also effects the 1.9.1 branch
on Linux (and presumably Windows) -- though only when using Sun's old
OJI plugin.
Interestingly, the proximate cause (on Linux and Windows) is actually
in our OJI code -- the nsCSecurityContext constructors assume that no
script principal (i.e. no JavaScript on the stack) means that Java
code should run with full privileges. And this assumption may not be
"wrong" -- nsScriptSecurityManager::SubjectPrincipalIsSystem() does
the same thing.

JEP 0.9.7.4 "fixed" this bug's security hole on OS X in FF versions
since 3.6.11 and 3.5.14 (and in Camino 2.0.5). (Though it also
triggered the breakage reported in [bug 606737](/show_bug.cgi?id=606737 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java Applet: JSObject.getWindow(this) returns null") and [bug 607678](/show_bug.cgi?id=607678 "RESOLVED FIXED - JEP 0.9.7.4 breaks (Yahoo! games, pogo.com) applets that attempt to open new windows in pop-up windows").)
But as I mentioned in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=610525#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - JavaScript-to-Java (nsISecureEnv) calls sometimes made with no JavaScript on stack"), it's very unlikely that this bug's
security hole is exploitable -- even using OS X distros that bundle
JEP 0.9.7.3 or earlier, or using the OJI plugin in FF 3.5.X on Linux
and Windows.
The only Java code called (via the nsISecureEnv interface) with full
privileges is code that's called from jsj\_enter\_js(). As best I can
tell, jsj\_enter\_js() doesn't call any Java code except the first time
it's run (to help initialize Java-to-JavaScript LiveConnect). This
code does nothing but load commonly used classes and find their fields
and methods (most of it is in jsj.c's init\_netscape\_java\_classes() and
init\_java\_VM\_reflection()) -- which is entirely harmless. And there
doesn't seem to be any way for "the user" to run Java code of his/her
own choice.

JSContextForPluginInstance() could use nsCOMPtr's instead of doing manual reference counting, but if that's for some reason hard I'm fine with doing it by hand here, as the patch does.

I've answered my own question -- this patch does need to land on the 1.9.0 branch, since current Camino releases are off that branch, and Camino 2.0.5 is effected by this bug (and [bug 606737](/show_bug.cgi?id=606737 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java Applet: JSObject.getWindow(this) returns null") and [bug 607678](/show_bug.cgi?id=607678 "RESOLVED FIXED - JEP 0.9.7.4 breaks (Yahoo! games, pogo.com) applets that attempt to open new windows in pop-up windows")).

The following has worked best for me:
1) Run Applications : Utilities : Java Preferences and
a) Click on the Advanced tab.
b) Under Java Console select Show console.
2) Load the testcase from [bug 606737](/show_bug.cgi?id=606737 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java Applet: JSObject.getWindow(this) returns null")
(<http://jnlp.dev.concord.org/test-japplet.html>).

## Details

Jesse Ruderman, Andreas Gal, Nils, Brian Hackett, and Igor Bukanov

discovered several memory issues in the browser engine. An attacker could

exploit these to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3776](/security/CVE-2010-3776), [CVE-2010-3777](/security/CVE-2010-3777), [CVE-2010-3778](/security/CVE-2010-3778))

It was discovered that Firefox did not properly verify the about:blank

location elements when it was opened via window.open(). An attacker could

exploit this to run arbitrary code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2010-3771](/security/CVE-2010-3771))

It was discovered that Firefox did not properly handle <div> elements

when processing a XUL tree. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious

web page, an attacker could exploit this to crash the browser or possibly

run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3772](/security/CVE-2010-3772))

Marc Schoenefeld and Christoph Diehl discovered several problems when

handling downloadable fonts. The new OTS font sanitizing library was added

to mitigate these issues. ([CVE-2010-3768](/security/CVE-2010-3768))

Gregory Fleischer discovered that the Java LiveConnect script could be made

to run in the wrong security context. An attacker could exploit this to

read local files and run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3775](/security/CVE-2010-3775))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could exploit this to

crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-3766](/security/CVE-2010-3766), [CVE-2010-3767](/security/CVE-2010-3767), [CVE-2010-3773](/security/CVE-2010-3773))

Michal Zalewski discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle

displaying pages from network or certificate errors. An attacker could

exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as in a phishing attack.

([CVE-2010-3774](/security/CVE-2010-3774))

Yosuke Hasegawa and Masatoshi Kimura discovered that several character

encodings would have some characters converted to angle brackets. An

attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

([CVE-2010-3770](/security/CVE-2010-3770))

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-79

## Java security bypass from LiveConnect loaded via data: URL meta refresh

Announced
December 9, 2010
Reporter
Gregory Fleischer
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.16
* Firefox 3.6.13
* SeaMonkey 2.0.11

### Description

Security researcher **Gregory Fleischer** reported
that when a Java LiveConnect script was loaded via
a `data:` URL which redirects via a meta refresh, then the
resulting plugin object was created with the wrong security principal
and thus received elevated privileges such as the abilities to read
local files, launch processes, and create network connections.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to update 3.6.13 to fix several security issues.
Also Mozilla Thunderbird and Seamonkey were updated on openSUSE.
Following security issues were fixed:
MFSA 2010-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several
memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough
effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
Jesee Ruderman, Andreas Gal, Nils, and Brian Hackett reported
memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and Firefox
3.5. (CVE-2010-3776)
Igor Bukanov reported a memory safety problem that was fixed in
Firefox 3.6 only. (CVE-2010-3777)
Jesse Ruderman reported a crash which affected Firefox 3.5 only. (CVE-2010-3778)
MFSA 2010-75 / CVE-2010-3769: Dirk Heinrich reported that on Windows
platforms when document.write() was called with a very long string
a buffer overflow was caused in line breaking routines attempting
to process the string for display. Such cases triggered an invalid
read past the end of an array causing a crash which an attacker could
potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-76 / CVE-2010-3771: Security researcher echo reported that
a web page could open a window with an about:blank location and then
inject an <isindex> element into that page which upon submission would
redirect to a chrome: document. The effect of this defect was that the
original page would wind up with a reference to a chrome-privileged
object, the opened window, which could be leveraged for privilege
escalation attacks.
Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 provided proof-of-concept
code demonstrating how the above vulnerability could be used to run
arbitrary code with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-77 / CVE-2010-3772: Security researcher wushi of team509
reported that when a XUL tree had an HTML <div> element nested inside a
<treechildren> element then code attempting to display content in the
XUL tree would incorrectly treat the <div> element as a parent node
to tree content underneath it resulting in incorrect indexes being
calculated for the child content. These incorrect indexes were used
in subsequent array operations which resulted in writing data past
the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could use this issue to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on their machine.
MFSA 2010-78 / CVE-2010-3768: Mozilla added the OTS font sanitizing
library to prevent downloadable fonts from exposing vulnerabilities
in the underlying OS font code. This library mitigates against several
issues independently reported by Red Hat Security Response Team member
Marc Schoenefeld and Mozilla security researcher Christoph Diehl.
MFSA 2010-79 / CVE-2010-3775: Security researcher Gregory Fleischer
reported that when a Java LiveConnect script was loaded via a data:
URL which redirects via a meta refresh, then the resulting plugin
object was created with the wrong security principal and thus received
elevated privileges such as the abilities to read local files, launch
processes, and create network connections.
MFSA 2010-80 / CVE-2010-3766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a nsDOMAttribute node
can be modified without informing the iterator object responsible
for various DOM traversals. This flaw could lead to a inconsistent
state where the iterator points to an object it believes is part of
the DOM but actually points to some other object. If such an object
had been deleted and its memory reclaimed by the system, then the
iterator could be used to call into attacker-controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-81 / CVE-2010-3767: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that JavaScript arrays
were vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability. The report
demonstrated that an array could be constructed containing a very
large number of items such that when memory was allocated to store the
array items, the integer value used to calculate the buffer size would
overflow resulting in too small a buffer being allocated. Subsequent
use of the array object could then result in data being written past
the end of the buffer and causing memory corruption.
MFSA 2010-82 / CVE-2010-3773: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the fix for CVE-2010-0179 could be circumvented
permitting the execution of arbitrary JavaScript with chrome
privileges.
MFSA 2010-83 / CVE-2010-3774: Google security researcher Michal
Zalewski reported that when a window was opened to a site resulting
in a network or certificate error page, the opening site could access
the document inside the opened window and inject arbitrary content. An
attacker could use this bug to spoof the location bar and trick a user
into thinking they were on a different site than they actually were.
MFSA 2010-84 / CVE-2010-3770: Security researchers Yosuke Hasegawa
and Masatoshi Kimura reported that the x-mac-arabic, x-mac-farsi and
x-mac-hebrew character encodings are vulnerable to XSS attacks due
to some characters being converted to angle brackets when displayed
by the rendering engine. Sites using these character encodings would
thus be potentially vulnerable to script injection attacks if their
script filtering code fails to strip out these specific characters.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart all running Mozilla instances after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |

| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
