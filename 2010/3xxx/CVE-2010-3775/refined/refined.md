Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how Firefox handles Java LiveConnect scripts loaded via a `data:` URL with a meta refresh. When such a script is loaded, the plugin object is created with an incorrect security principal. This results in the Java plugin being granted elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Security Principal:** The primary vulnerability is the incorrect assignment of a security principal to the Java plugin when loaded through a specific chain of actions. The security principal of the script was set to "moz-nullprincipal" which was then incorrectly handled.
*   **Elevated Privileges:** Due to the incorrect principal, the Java plugin gains unauthorized privileges.
*  **Improper handling of the "data:" scheme and meta refresh:** The browser did not properly handle the interaction between the data: url scheme and the meta refresh tag which lead to the java plugin being loaded with the incorrect security principal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:

*   **Read Local Files:** Access and read files on the user's system.
*   **Execute Arbitrary Code:** Run code on the user's system with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
*   **Create Network Connections:** Make network connections to external servers.
* **Crash the JVM:** In some cases the vulnerability could lead to a crash of the Java Virtual Machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Content:** A website hosting malicious HTML code can trigger this vulnerability.
*   **`data:` URL and Meta Refresh:** The attack requires a specific construct using a `data:` URL and a meta refresh tag to load the vulnerable LiveConnect script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through a malicious website.
*   **Ability to Craft HTML:** The attacker must have the capability to craft HTML code that contains the necessary `data:` URL and meta refresh.
*   **No User Interaction (mostly):** The vulnerability can be exploited simply by a user visiting a specially crafted website, although some additional user interaction to trigger applets could be required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was observed to affect different platforms and JRE versions differently. For instance, on Mac OS X with Apple Java, it allowed reading files, connecting to sockets, and executing programs, while on Windows and Linux with certain Oracle/Sun Java versions it crashed the JVM.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects old-style Java plugins (using LiveConnect) and not npruntime scripting, affecting older Firefox branches such as 1.9.2 and 1.9.1
*  A fix was implemented by blocking javascript-to-java LiveConnect when a subject principal other than the system principal with an ill-formed origin is encountered. A URL scheme whitelist approach was implemented to prevent the issue from occurring
