Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it's displayed back to the user. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by data passed through the "desc", "price", "title", and "place" parameters in the "index.php" file and the "subject" parameter in "contact.htm".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML and script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code within the user's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Potentially gaining access to sensitive data or the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs or forms that include malicious script code in the vulnerable parameters:
  - `index.php` with the parameters `desc`, `price`, `title`, or `place`
  - `contact.htm` with the `subject` parameter.
  
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be a remote user with the ability to craft malicious requests. The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges. They need to be able to get the victim to visit the crafted link or submit a malicious form.

**Additional Details (from pridels-team.blogspot.com):**
- The vulnerability is confirmed to affect Open Classifieds versions 1.7.0.2, 1.7.0 and possibly earlier versions.
- The suggested solution is to filter malicious characters and character sequences in a web proxy, although proper input sanitization within the application itself would be more ideal.
