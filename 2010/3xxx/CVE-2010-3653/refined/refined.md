**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An array-indexing error exists in the handling of "rcsL" chunks within Adobe Shockwave Player. Specifically, a crafted Director file with a specific value in an "rcsL" field can trigger a memory corruption vulnerability during chunk parsing, leading to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is located in the function at address 0x68122990 within the Shockwave Player. By controlling the value in the rcsL chunk, an attacker can influence an indirect call (dword ptr [ecx+eax*8+20h]) and redirect program execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to an array-indexing error.
- Unvalidated data within the "rcsL" chunk allows an attacker to control an offset used in an indirect call.
-  An integer value within the 'rcsL' chunk can be manipulated to reach a vulnerable part of the code.
- Lack of proper bounds checking during array indexing.
- Indirect call vulnerability where the attacker can partially control the called address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, which could lead to complete system compromise.
- Denial of service by causing the Shockwave player to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by creating a malicious Director file (.dir or .dcr) and distributing it to users. 
- The crafted file is loaded through the Shockwave Player plugin which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious Director file with a specific value in the "rcsL" chunk.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to a target user (e.g. via a website, email attachment, etc.)
- No specific attacker privilege or position required, just the ability to get the victim to open the crafted file.
