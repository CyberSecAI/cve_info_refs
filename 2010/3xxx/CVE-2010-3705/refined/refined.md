```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability exists in the `sctp_auth_asoc_get_hmac()` function, specifically when parsing a peer's supported HMAC authentication options. A malicious peer can craft their HMAC array to cause an out-of-bounds read, leading to memory corruption due to the use of the retrieved out-of-bounds data.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Out-of-bounds read in the `sctp_auth_asoc_get_hmac()` function.
- Memory corruption due to the use of out-of-bounds data.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service via kernel panic.
- Possible privilege escalation or other negative impacts as a result of the memory corruption.
- Loss of privacy if an attacker manages to read sensitive kernel memory.

Attack vectors:
- Remote: A malicious peer can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted SCTP packets.
- Local: A local user acting as both endpoints of an SCTP connection can trigger the vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send or receive SCTP packets.
- The "auth_enable" sysctl must be set on the vulnerable system for the vulnerability to be triggered.
