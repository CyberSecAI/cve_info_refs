## Introduction

BIND 9.7.2-P2 is a maintenance release for BIND 9.7.

This document summarizes changes from BIND 9.7.1 to BIND 9.7.2-P2. Please see the CHANGES file in the source code release for a complete list of all changes.

## Download

The latest release of BIND 9 software can always be found on our web site at
<http://www.isc.org/software/bind>. There you will find additional information about each release, source code, and some pre-compiled versions for certain operating systems.

## Support

Product support information is available on
<http://www.isc.org/services/support>
for paid support options. Free support is provided by our user community via a mailing list. Information on all public email lists is available at
<https://lists.isc.org/mailman/listinfo>.

## New Features

* Zones may be dynamically added and removed with the ârndc addzoneâ and ârndc delzoneâ commands. These dynamically added zones are written to a per-view configuration file. Do not rely on the configuration file name nor contents as this will change in a future release. This is an experimental feature at this time.
* Added new âfilter-aaaa-on-v4â access control list to select which IPv4 clients have AAAA record filtering applied.
* A new command ârndc secrootsâ was added to dump a combined summary of the currently managed keys combined with statically configured trust anchors.
* Added support to load new keys into managed zones without signing immediately with "rndc loadkeys". Added support to link keys with "dnssec-keygen -S" and "dnssec-settime -S".

## Changes

* Documentation improvements
* ORCHID prefixes were removed from the automatic empty zone list.
* Improved handling of GSSAPI security contexts. Specifically, better memory management of cached contexts, limited lifetime of a context to 1 hour, and added a ârealmâ command to nsupdate to allow selection of a non-default realm name.
* The contributed tool âztkâ was updated to version 1.0.

## Security Fixes

* If BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validating server, has two or more trust
  anchors configured in named.conf for the same zone (such as
  example.com) and the response for a record in that zone from the
  authoritative server includes a bad signature, the validating server
  will crash while trying to validate that query.
* A flaw where the wrong ACL was applied was fixed. This flaw allowed access to a cache via recursion even though the ACL disallowed it.

## Bug Fixes

* Removed a warning message when running BIND 9 under Windows for when a TCP connection was aborted. This is a common occurrence and the warning was extraneous.
* Worked around a race condition in the cache database memory handling. Without this fix a DNS cache DB or ADB could incorrectly stay in an over memory state, effectively refusing further caching, which subsequently made a BIND 9 caching server unworkable.
* Partially disabled change 2864 because it would cause infinite attempts of RRSIG queries.
* BIND did not properly handle non-cacheable negative responses from insecure zones. This caused several non-protocol-compliant zones to become unresolvable. BIND is now more accepting of responses it receives from less strict servers.
* A bug, introduced in BIND 9.7.2, caused named to fail to start if a master zone file was unreadable or missing. This has been corrected in 9.7.2-P1.
* BIND previously accepted answers from authoritative servers that did
  not provide a "proper" response, such as not setting AA bit. BIND was
  changed to be more strict in what it accepted but this caused
  operational issues. This new strictness has been backed out in
  9.7.2-P1.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2130-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer

Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3762 CVE-2010-3614 CVE-2010-3613

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in BIND, an
implementation of the DNS protocol suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-3762
	When DNSSEC validation is enabled, BIND does not properly
	handle certain bad signatures if multiple trust anchors exist
	for a single zone, which allows remote attackers to cause a
	denial of service (server crash) via a DNS query.

CVE-2010-3614
	BIND does not properly determine the security status of an NS
	RRset during a DNSKEY algorithm rollover, which may lead to
	zone unavailability during rollovers.

CVE-2010-3613
	BIND does not properly handle the combination of signed
	negative responses and corresponding RRSIG records in the
	cache, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
	service (server crash) via a query for cached data.

In addition, this security update improves compatibility with
previously installed versions of the bind9 package.  As a result, it
is necessary to initiate the update with "apt-get dist-upgrade"
instead of "apt-get update".

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.6.ESV.R3+dfsg-0+lenny1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
1:9.7.2.dfsg.P3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get dist-upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

bind security update (RHSA-2010-0976)

Original Release Date: January 12, 2011

Last Revised: April 5, 2012

Number: ASA-2011-004

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain
Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver
library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and
tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

It was discovered that named did not invalidate previously cached RRSIG
records when adding an NCACHE record for the same entry to the cache. A
remote attacker allowed to send recursive DNS queries to named could use
this flaw to crash named. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3613](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3613.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the DNSSEC validation code in named. If named had
multiple trust anchors configured for a zone, a response to a request for a
record in that zone with a bad signature could cause named to crash.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3762](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3762.html) to this issue.

It was discovered that, in certain cases, named did not properly perform
DNSSEC validation of an NS RRset for zones in the middle of a DNSKEY
algorithm rollover. This flaw could cause the validator to incorrectly
determine that the zone is insecure and not protected by DNSSEC.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3614](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3614.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0976.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Communication Manager | 6.0.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 6.2 or later. |
| Avaya IQ | 5.0, 5.1 | Low | Upgrade to IQ 5.2 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to PS 6.1.2 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2, 6.0.x, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to SM 5.2.4 or later 5.2.x version, or upgrade to SM 6.1.2 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager | 5.2, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to SMGR 6.2 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Platform | 1.1, 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2 | Low | Upgrade to SP 6.0.3 or later. |
| Avaya Voice Portal | 5.0, 5.1, 5.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to VP 5.1.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for the listed affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-3613 CVE-2010-3614 CVE-2010-3762 | CM, IQ, PS, SMGR, SP and VP are rated a low risk due to the bind service not running or configured by default. Only the bind-libs and bind-utils packages are installed on these products. SM is rated a low risk due to the bind server listening only on the local server which doesn't allow remote queries. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.
