{
  "CVE-2010-3762": {
    "Description": "If BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validating server, has two or more trust anchors configured in named.conf for the same zone (such as example.com) and the response for a record in that zone from the authoritative server includes a bad signature, the validating server will crash while trying to validate that query.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of bad signatures when multiple trust anchors are configured for the same zone.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of DNSSEC signatures",
      "Insufficient validation of DNSSEC responses"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (server crash).",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Sending a DNS query that triggers DNSSEC validation with a bad signature from the authoritative server."
        ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send recursive DNS queries to a BIND server acting as a validating resolver and control the authoritative server to respond with a bad signature."
