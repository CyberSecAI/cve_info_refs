    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A memory handling error occurs when Microsoft Excel validates record information upon opening a specially crafted Excel file, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of record information in specially crafted Excel files",
        "Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds record parsing"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the logged-on user. This can lead to complete system compromise, including installing malware, data theft, modification or deletion, and the creation of new accounts with administrative rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Email: Sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and convincing them to open it.",
        "Web-based: Hosting a website with a malicious Excel file, or compromising a legitimate website to host such content, and convincing the user to visit the site and open the file."
      ],
