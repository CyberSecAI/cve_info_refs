**Affected Versions:**
HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23 and B.11.31 running HP JDK and JRE
6.0.09 or earlier

HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23 and B.11.31 running HP JDK and JRE 5.0.21 or earlier

HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23 and B.11.31 running HP Java SDK and RTE 1.4.2.26 or
earlier

More information about this vulnerability can be found in the security advisory issued by HP:

* <http://alerts.hp.com/r?2.1.3KT.2ZR.zERGu.FLa3n%5f..T.VVow.3%2a3q.bW89MQ%5f%5fDBQMFQR0>

## 2. Avaya System Products with HP-UX Running Java:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Proactive Contact | 3.0.x | Low | Upgrade to PC 4.2.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Overview

The Oracle products and components listed above are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2010-175626.html) addresses 85 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components, including 31 vulnerabilities in Sun products. The Advisory provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. More detail about one of the vulnerabilities is available in US-CERT Vulnerability Note [VU#174089](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/174089).

The Oracle Siebel Suite Executive Summary section of the Oracle Advisory notes, "None of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., none may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password." A system with the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control installed on it can be attacked remotely by an unauthenticated attacker by enticing the user to access a specially crafted HTML file (most likely a web site controlled by the attacker).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2010-175626.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.

Original Release Date: October 29, 2010

Last Revised: August 20, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-308

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit.

defaultReadObject of the Serialization API could be tricked into setting a
volatile field multiple times, which could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the applet
or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3569](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3569.html) to this issue.

Race condition in the way objects were deserialized could allow an
untrusted applet or application to misuse the privileges of the user
running the applet or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3568](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3568.html) to this issue.

Miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering implementation caused
out-of-bounds memory access, which could allow remote attackers to execute
code with the privileges of the user running the java process.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3567](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3567.html) to this issue.

JPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the imageio API improperly checked certain
image metadata, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the user running the applet or application.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3565](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3565.html) to this issue.

Double free in IndexColorModel could cause an untrusted applet or
application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the applet or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3562](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3562.html) to this issue.

The privileged accept method of the ServerSocket class in the Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) implementation in OpenJDK allowed it to
receive connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current
connection. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined
by network permissions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3561](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3561.html) to this issue.

Flaws in the Swing library could allow an untrusted application to modify
the behavior and state of certain JDK classes. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3557](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3557.html) to this issue.

Flaws in the CORBA implementation could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code by misusing permissions granted to certain system objects.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3554](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3554.html) to this issue.

UIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection usage, allowing untrusted
callers to create objects via ProxyLazyValue values. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3553](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3553.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection improperly handled the "chunked" transfer encoding
method, which could allow remote attackers to conduct HTTP response
splitting attacks. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3549](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3549.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection improperly checked whether the calling code was granted
the "allowHttpTrace" permission, allowing untrusted code to create HTTP
TRACE requests. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3574](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3574.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection did not validate request headers set by applets, which
could allow remote attackers to trigger actions otherwise restricted to
HTTP clients. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-3541](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3541.html) and [CVE-2010-3573](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3573.html) to these issues.

The Kerberos implementation improperly checked the sanity of AP-REQ
requests, which could cause a denial of service condition in the receiving
Java Virtual Machine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3564](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3564.html) to this issue.

The RHSA-2010:0339 update mitigated a man-in-the-middle attack in the way
the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update
implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC
5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3555.html) to this issue.

The NetworkInterface class improperly checked the network "connect"
permissions for local network addresses, which could allow remote attackers
to read local network addresses. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3551](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3551.html) to this issue.

Information leak flaw in the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
could allow a remote attacker to access information about
otherwise-protected internal network names. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3548](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3548.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0768.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.6.0-openjdk installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0 | Medium | See recommended actions and Mitigating Factors table below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. It is recommended that customers migrate to one of Avaya's conferencing solutions including Aura® Conferencing 7.0 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Platform | 1.1, 6.0 thru 6.0.3.5.3 | Low | Upgrade to SP6.0 Patch 6.0.3.6.3 or later. Rated a Low Risk since the jdk in Domain-0 is not a daemon and is used in a very limited fashion for a single application that is not accessible through the network interface. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## Details

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and

SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject

arbitrary content at the beginning of the user's session. USN-923-1

disabled SSL/TLS renegotiation by default; this update implements

the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC 5746,

and thus supports secure renegotiation between updated clients and

servers. ([CVE-2009-3555](/security/CVE-2009-3555))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate

request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker to

trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients. ([CVE-2010-3541](/security/CVE-2010-3541))

It was discovered that JNDI could leak information that would allow an

attacker to to access information about otherwise-protected internal

network names. ([CVE-2010-3548](/security/CVE-2010-3548))

It was discovered that HttpURLConnection improperly handled the

"chunked" transfer encoding method, which could allow attackers to

conduct HTTP response splitting attacks. ([CVE-2010-3549](/security/CVE-2010-3549))

It was discovered that the NetworkInterface class improperly

checked the network "connect" permissions for local network

addresses. This could allow an attacker to read local network

addresses. ([CVE-2010-3551](/security/CVE-2010-3551))

It was discovered that UIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection

usage, allowing an attacker to create objects. ([CVE-2010-3553](/security/CVE-2010-3553))

It was discovered that multiple flaws in the CORBA reflection

implementation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by

misusing permissions granted to certain system objects. ([CVE-2010-3554](/security/CVE-2010-3554))

It was discovered that unspecified flaws in the Swing library could

allow untrusted applications to modify the behavior and state of

certain JDK classes. ([CVE-2010-3557](/security/CVE-2010-3557))

It was discovered that the privileged accept method of the ServerSocket

class in the CORBA implementation allowed it to receive connections

from any host, instead of just the host of the current connection.

An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined by

network permissions. ([CVE-2010-3561](/security/CVE-2010-3561))

It was discovered that there exists a double free in java's

indexColorModel that could allow an attacker to cause an applet

or application to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privilege of the user running the java applet or

application. ([CVE-2010-3562](/security/CVE-2010-3562))

It was discovered that the Kerberos implementation improperly checked

AP-REQ requests, which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of

service against the receiving JVM. ([CVE-2010-3564](/security/CVE-2010-3564))

It was discovered that improper checks of unspecified image metadata in

JPEGImageWriter.writeImage of the imageio API could allow an attacker

to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running a

java applet or application. ([CVE-2010-3565](/security/CVE-2010-3565))

It was discovered that an unspecified vulnerability in the ICC

profile handling code could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user running a java applet or

application. ([CVE-2010-3566](/security/CVE-2010-3566))

It was discovered that a miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering

implementation would allow out-of-bounds memory access. This could

allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user running a java application. ([CVE-2010-3567](/security/CVE-2010-3567))

It was discovered that an unspecified race condition in the way

objects were deserialized could allow an attacker to cause an applet

or application to misuse the privileges of the user running the java

applet or application. ([CVE-2010-3568](/security/CVE-2010-3568))

It was discovered that the defaultReadObject of the Serialization

API could be tricked into setting a volatile field multiple times.

This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user running a java applet or application.

([CVE-2010-3569](/security/CVE-2010-3569))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate

request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker to

trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients. ([CVE-2010-3573](/security/CVE-2010-3573))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class improperly checked

whether the calling code was granted the "allowHttpTrace" permission,

allowing an attacker to create HTTP TRACE requests. ([CVE-2010-3574](/security/CVE-2010-3574))
