      "status": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because of the way that Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted Office files leading to memory corruption.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of drawing exceptions",
          "Memory corruption vulnerability"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user, potentially gaining complete control of the affected system. An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Email attack: The attacker sends a specially crafted Office file to the user and convinces the user to open the file.",
          "Web-based attack: The attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted Office file or compromises a legitimate website to host such content. The attacker must convince the user to visit the site and open the file."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted Office file and deliver it to the target user. The attacker also needs to convince the user to open the malicious file.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted Office file. The issue lies in how the software handles drawing exceptions. The vulnerability exists in a shared component of Microsoft Office, so multiple applications may be affected. The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email; a user must open a file sent as an attachment."
