Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The TYPO3 backend failed to properly sanitize user input, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Additionally, the `RemoveXSS` function, intended to filter out malicious JavaScript code, was incomplete and could be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities existed in the TYPO3 backend due to inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input.
*   **Incomplete Input Filtering:** The `RemoveXSS` function did not effectively filter all Javascript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the backend. This could lead to various attacks such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the backend interface
    *   Phishing
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields or parameters within the TYPO3 backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Backend Access:**  A valid backend login is required to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities in the backend.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable input:** Attacker must identify where to inject the malicious script.
