{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2010-3131",
    "Root cause": "Mozilla Firefox attempts to load the 'dwmapi.dll' library upon startup as part of its platform detection. On Windows XP, this library is not present, causing Firefox to try loading it from the current working directory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "DLL hijacking vulnerability",
      "Insecure DLL loading"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could place a malicious 'dwmapi.dll' in the same directory as a specially crafted HTML file. When the user opens the HTML file, Firefox will load and execute the malicious DLL.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local: User opens a malicious HTML file in the same directory as a malicious DLL.",
       "Remote: A malicious DLL can be loaded via a UNC path if the attacker is on the same network as the victim."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious DLL and deliver it alongside a malicious HTML file. For remote exploitation, the attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim."
  }
