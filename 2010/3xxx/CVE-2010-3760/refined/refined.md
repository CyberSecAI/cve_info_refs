Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference occurs within the `FastBackMount.exe` component due to a failed memory allocation. The failed allocation is a result of an attacker providing a large size value, which triggers an exception handler. During the logging process within the exception handler, a null pointer is dereferenced while attempting to create a string, leading to the crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference.
- Improper error handling during memory allocation failures.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization of size values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Specifically, the `FastBackMount.exe` process terminates, disrupting service to clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely.
- It's specifically targeted at the `FastBackMount.exe` component, which listens on TCP port 30051 by default.
- The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the machine running the vulnerable `FastBackMount.exe` process on TCP port 30051.
- No prior authentication is required to carry out the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-10-188, and the corresponding filter for Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS is 10327.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2010-06-17, and the advisory was publicly released on 2010-09-30.
- The affected product is IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack.
- The CVSS score is 7.8 with the vector AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C indicating high impact on availability and easily exploitable via network.
