## Details

Marc Schoenefeld discovered that FreeType did not correctly handle certain

malformed font files. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted

font file, a remote attacker could cause FreeType to crash or possibly

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-3311](/security/CVE-2010-3311))

Chris Evans discovered that FreeType did not correctly handle certain

malformed TrueType font files. If a user were tricked into using a

specially crafted TrueType file, a remote attacker could cause FreeType to

crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10, 10.04 LTS and 10.10. ([CVE-2010-3814](/security/CVE-2010-3814))

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

## [Discussion](#discussion)

|
|  |
| [Tue 12 Oct 2010 05:55:19 AM UTC, comment #1:](#comment1)   This should be fixed in the git.  Thanks for the report.  Please test.   Unfortunately, I don't have a GX font for testing which calls `ft\_var\_readpackedpoints' at all.  If you have such a font I would be glad if you could provide it to me privately. | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |
| [Mon 11 Oct 2010 11:03:45 PM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0)   The function ft\_var\_readpackedpoints() in src/truetype/ttgxvar.c has a buffer overflow, leading to crashes and potential code execution.   When parsing a malicious TrueType GX font with n set to a lower value than runcnt, the for loops in the function will keep writing outside of allocated memory.   This was tested on version 2.4.3.   -- "van damme's brain cell" | Anonymous |
