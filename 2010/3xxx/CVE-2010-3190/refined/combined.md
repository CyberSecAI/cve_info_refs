How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability in Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2500212)

Published: April 12, 2011 | Updated: October 9, 2018

**Version:** 5.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in certain applications built using the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a legitimate file associated with such an affected application, and the file is located in the same network folder as a specially crafted library file. For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a document from this location that is then loaded by the affected application.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Visual Studio and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which applications built using MFC load external libraries. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2500212](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2500212) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

This is a detection change only. There were no changes to the security update files. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.

**Why was this bulletin rereleased on August 9, 2011?**

Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to add Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 (KB2565057) and Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package Service Pack 1 (KB2565063) as Affected Software, and to correct the file verification information for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package, Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package, and Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package.

**Why was this bulletin rereleased on June 14, 2011?**

Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to reoffer the update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1, Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1, Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package, and Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package. This reoffered update replaces the previous update to address the following issues:

* International customers with localized applications see certain parts of MFC application resources non-localized. The applications remain functional, but the resources display in English.
* The MFC security fix uses an API that is not supported on Microsoft Windows 2000. When deploying the update on Microsoft Windows 2000 systems, the installation resulted in functionality issues for some applications.
* The update did not install for users with Windows 7 SDK on x64-based architecture.

Customers who have previously installed this update should install the new packages on the affected systems.

**Why was this bulletin rereleased on April 21, 2011?**

Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to reoffer the updates to address a known issue in which the updates were erroneously offered to Microsoft Windows 2000 systems, which are no longer in support. This is a detection change only. There were no changes to the security update files in this bulletin. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to reinstall this update.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Will I be offered this update even if I have no suitable attack vectors on my system?**

This update will be offered to all systems running software as outlined in the Affected Software section. In the case where a system has no MFC applications currently installed but does have the vulnerable Visual Studio or Visual C++ runtimes installed, Microsoft recommends that users install this update as a defense-in-depth measure, in case of an attack vector being introduced or becoming known at a later time.

Users with no MFC applications and none of the software listed in the Affected Software section installed will not be offered the update and do not need to take any action.

**Are there any Microsoft applications that can be used as an attack vector?**

Microsoft has carefully researched all applications but found no Microsoft applications that could be successfully used as an attack vector.

**Is Microsoft aware of any third-party MFC applications that can be used as an attack vector?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of one third-party application that can be used as an attack vector. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability using this third-party attack vector would require a user to open a specially crafted file with the MFC application, then double-click a folder inside the MFC application.

**I have written an application using Microsoft Foundation Classes. Can my application be used as an attack vector?**

Your application may be an attack vector if all of the following conditions are true:

* Your application makes use of the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library
* Your application allows the loading of dynamic link libraries from untrusted locations, such as WebDAV shares

**Note** Microsoft recommends that MFC applications dynamically link to MFC. If your application statically links to a vulnerable version of MFC, we highly recommend that you update your application to dynamically link to MFC. Otherwise, you will be required to rebuild your application every time a security update for MFC is released.

**What is the difference between the Visual C++ Redistributable packages and the other Visual Studio updates?**

The Visual C++ Redistributable packages are full versions of this product that can be redistributed by anyone with their applications. Developers who need to deliver the Visual C++ Redistributable should pick up these packages and bundle them or chain them into their setups. The other Visual Studio updates are available for developers who have previously installed an older version of the Visual C++ Redistributable product or have installed the Visual Studio product. These update packages are offered to developers through Microsoft Update only and will be applicable only if an earlier version of the Visual C++ Redistributable or Visual Studio is present.

**I am a third-party application developer and I use Visual C++. How do I update my application?**

The method for updating applications developed with Visual C++ depends on how you link to the MFC libraries and whether or not you distribute your applications with the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package:

* Developers whose applications statically link to the MFC libraries need to apply the update offered in this bulletin, recompile the application, and redeliver the application to end users (or release an update for the application).
* Developers whose applications dynamically link to the MFC libraries, but who do not distribute Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package with their application, need to apply the update offered in this bulletin, recompile their application, and redeliver the application to end users (or release an update for the application).
* Developers whose applications dynamically link to the MFC libraries and who distribute Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package with the application do not need to recompile their applications, as end users will receive the update offered in this bulletin directly through automatic updating. All customers with the affected software should update their systems to be protected from the vulnerability described in this bulletin.

**Is this update related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637?**

Yes, the vulnerability addressed by this update is related to the class of vulnerabilities, described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2269637), that affects how applications load external libraries. This security update addresses a particular instance of this type of vulnerability.

## MFC Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3190

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that certain applications built Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) handle the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-3190](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3190).

#### Mitigating Factors for MFC Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3190

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a file associated with an affected application built using MFC.
* The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for MFC Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3190

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.

  Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to deploy the registry key to block loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.
* **Disable the WebClient service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, perform the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, perform the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for MFC Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3190

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when applications built using MFC incorrectly restrict the path used for loading external libraries.

**What is the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library?**

The Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library is an application framework for programming in Microsoft Windows. Written in C++, MFC provides much of the code necessary for performing standard operations such as managing windows, menus, and dialog boxes; performing basic input/output; and storing collections of data objects.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate file associated with the application built using MFC that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the file, the affected application could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a legitimate file associated with the application built using MFC to a user, and convincing the user to place the attachment into a directory containing a specially crafted DLL file and to open the file. Then, when opening the file, the affected application could attempt to load the DLL and execute any code it contained.

In a network scenario, an attacker could place a legitimate file associated with the application built using MFC and a specially crafted DLL in a UNC or WebDAV location and then convince the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability mainly affects workstations where users may be expected to open attachments from untrusted network locations. Servers could also be at risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting the manner in which applications built using MFC load external libraries.

**Is this vulnerability related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637?**

Yes, the vulnerability addressed by this update is related to the class of vulnerabilities, described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2269637), that affects how applications load external libraries. This security update addresses a particular instance of this type of vulnerability.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2010-3190](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3190).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
