## Blackboard Transact database credentials disclosure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#204055

Original Release Date: 2010-09-01 | Last Revised: 2010-09-23

---

### Overview

The Blackboard Transact application contains two vulnerabilities that allow an unauthorized user to access the database credentials.

### Description

| The Blackboard Transact application (previously know as Blackboard Commerce Suite) comes with a utility called BbtsConnection\_Edit.exe that is used to edit the encrypted configuration file named connection.xml. When editing connection.xml, BbtsConnection\_Edit.exe decrypts all the fields except the **<Password>** field. If a user opens the connection.xml file in text editor and copies the data for **<Password>** into any other field such as **<Server>**, then the BbtsConnection\_Edit.exe program will display the password in the other field, in this example **<Server>**.  An additional issue exists in that the Blackboard Transact application uses multiple script and batch (.bat) files for automated backup procedures that contain the database username and password in clear text. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker who has access to BbtsConnection\_Edit.exe and the connection.xml file, or read access to the backup scripts, can obtain the database username and password. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**The vendor has acknowledged these issues and additional information is available in the Vendors Affected section of this document. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**It may be possible to set file permissions on BbtsConnection\_Edit.exe, connection.xml, and the script and batch (.bat) files used for automated backup procedures to restrict access by administrators only. |
