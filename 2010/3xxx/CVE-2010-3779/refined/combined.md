```
I thought I'd write one mail about this, rather than duplicate the whole
thing to both v1.2.15 and v2.0.5 release announcements.

So, ever since this commit:

2009-11-10  Timo Sirainen  <[tss at iki.fi](http://dovecot.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dovecot)>

	* src/plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c:
	acl: Merge group rights if user belongs to more than one.
	[76ff6831c9ae]

The ACLs were being merged, rather than fully replaced, a bit too often.
Since this is about merging, the problem could have happened only when
using more than one entry in the ACL file. The main problems created by
this were:

a) If admin wanted to remove some rights from mailboxes in user's
private namespace (e.g. symlinked shared mailboxes), they may not have
gotten removed.

b) When mixing up multiple ACL entries, such as groups/users the more
specific entry may not have replaced the previous entry (e.g.
group-override may not have worked as expected).

The bug happened when two or more ACL entries of same "type" existed.
The first entry was handled correctly, but the next ones may have only
been adding ACLs rather than replacing them. For example if you had the
following ACL file:

group=people lrwi
user=foo lr
user=bar lr

So basically everyone in "people" group should have "lrwi" rights, but
foo and bar users should have only "lr" rights. If foo and bar didn't
belong to people group, everything would work as expected. If they did,
then what would happen is:

 * foo would work correctly, because it was the first entry of user
type.
 * bar would keep "lrwi" rights, because the previous entry (user=foo)
was of the same type (both are "user" type), so Dovecot decided to add
the rights on top of group=people entry rather than replace them.

BTW. The other ACL bug/"feature" of automatically adding admin rights
that was fixed in v1.2.15 was already fixed in v2.0.beta2.

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1059-1: Dovecot vulnerabilities

7 February 2011

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [dovecot](/security/cves?package=dovecot) -

## Details

It was discovered that the ACL plugin in Dovecot would incorrectly

propagate ACLs to new mailboxes. A remote authenticated user could possibly

read new mailboxes that were created with the wrong ACL. ([CVE-2010-3304](/security/CVE-2010-3304))

It was discovered that the ACL plugin in Dovecot would incorrectly merge

ACLs in certain circumstances. A remote authenticated user could possibly

bypass intended access restrictions and gain access to mailboxes.

([CVE-2010-3706](/security/CVE-2010-3706), [CVE-2010-3707](/security/CVE-2010-3707))

It was discovered that the ACL plugin in Dovecot would incorrectly grant

the admin permission to owners of certain mailboxes. A remote authenticated

user could possibly bypass intended access restrictions and gain access to

mailboxes. ([CVE-2010-3779](/security/CVE-2010-3779))

It was discovered that Dovecot incorrecly handled the simultaneous

disconnect of a large number of sessions. A remote authenticated user could

use this flaw to cause Dovecot to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2010-3780](/security/CVE-2010-3780))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [dovecot-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot)
  -
  [1:1.2.12-1ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot/1%3A1.2.12-1ubuntu8.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [dovecot-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot)
  -
  [1:1.2.9-1ubuntu6.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot/1%3A1.2.9-1ubuntu6.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

See the "ACL handling bugs" message for more details about the ACL
merging bug.

	* acl: Fixed the logic of merging multiple ACL entries. Now it works as
	  documented, while previously it could have done slightly different
	  things depending on the order of the entries.

	* acl: Don't give admin rights to all owner mailboxes. This was
	  originally done to make sure that mailbox owner couldn't accidentally
	  remove their own admin rights. But this is already prevented by
	  SETACL command, so it's not necessary. Also sysadmin may have
	  intentionally removed some admin rights from some mailboxes
	  (especially when using symlinked shared mailboxes).

	- Maildir: Fixed potential "Duplicate file entry" in dovecot-uidlist
	  file errors.
	- Maildir: Avoid unnecessary uidlist recreation during mail delivery.
	- imap: When SELECT fails, it didn't close the previous mailbox.
	- Dovecot master process could have died if it got SIGCHLD signals
	  very rapidly while it was trying to log. This could have happened
	  for example if a lot of imap/pop3 sessions disconnected at the exact
	  same time.
