  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-3615",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an error in the processing of the 'allow-query' access control specifier in ISC BIND. When 'named' is running as an authoritative server for a zone, it should check for 'allow-query' access control lists (ACLs) in the zone statement, then in the view, and then in global options. However, if the 'allow-query' is not set in the zone statement, it incorrectly fails to check the view or global options, and falls back to the default of allowing any query.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect access control implementation",
        "Failure to properly check configuration settings"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows queries that the zone owner did not wish to allow, potentially exposing sensitive DNS records and enabling unauthorized access to zone data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Sending DNS queries to a vulnerable BIND server configured as authoritative for a zone with an unset allow-query in zone statement."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to send DNS queries to the vulnerable server."
      ],
        "additional_information": "This bug does not affect 'allow-recursion' or 'allow-query-cache' ACLs. It affects ISC BIND versions prior to 9.7.2-P3."
