```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "DLL Hijacking",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Windows Internet Communication Settings application loads schannel.dll from an insecure location, allowing a malicious DLL with the same name to be loaded instead.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution. In this specific exploit, it executes calc.exe, demonstrating the potential to run any malicious payload.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL named schannel.dll in a location where it will be loaded instead of the legitimate one when the 'Windows Internet Communication Settings' application is launched. User interaction is also likely needed to launch the application."
