Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-3603:

**Vulnerability 1: CSRF Move Files for Download and DOS Attack**

*   **Root Cause:** The `FileService.ashx` service allows file moves without proper authorization checks, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Weakness:**
    *   Lack of CSRF protection on the `movefile` command within the `FileService.ashx`.
    *   The file service allows moving files to arbitrary paths, including the application root, which contains sensitive files.
*  **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DOS):** An attacker can rename the `user.config` file, causing the site to stop working on the next application pool recycle due to the inability to locate the connection string.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** After renaming, the attacker can download the `user.config` file, potentially revealing sensitive information such as database connection strings and other configuration details.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Social engineering of an admin user. The admin is tricked into visiting a malicious website while being logged into the vulnerable application.
    *   The malicious website sends an AJAX request to the vulnerable `FileService.ashx` endpoint using the admin's session.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage.
    *   Attacker needs to socially engineer a logged-in administrator of the vulnerable application to visit their hosted webpage.

**Vulnerability 2: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** User-provided data (user ID) was not properly sanitized before being used in the page title on the profile page.
*   **Weakness:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization/validation on the user ID field during user registration.
    *   Unsanitized user ID is outputted in the title tag of the profile page.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Malicious JavaScript code embedded within the user ID field during registration gets executed when a user views the profile page of the malicious user. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*  **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker registers an account with a malicious payload in the user ID field.
    *   When other users view the profile of the malicious user, the script gets executed in their browsers.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *  Attacker needs to register an account with a malicious user ID.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content also mentions a potential third issue related to an ASP.NET vulnerability, but this was later found to be mitigated by a default configuration in mojoPortal and was not considered an issue directly related to this CVE. This third issue relates to a vulnerability in how ASP.NET handles cryptographic errors, potentially allowing an attacker to decrypt session cookies. Although this is not related to CVE-2010-3603 it is included in the blog post because it was topical to the release at the time.
*   The content references a post-installation checklist that should be reviewed to ensure a secure configuration of the application.

**Summary**

The identified vulnerabilities are a CSRF vulnerability that allows an attacker to move sensitive files and a persistent XSS vulnerability, both present in mojoPortal 2-3-4-3. Both issues can be exploited remotely by attackers with social engineering capabilities and have severe impact on application availability and data security.
