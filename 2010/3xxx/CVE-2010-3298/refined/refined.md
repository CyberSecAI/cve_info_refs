```
{
  "CVE-2010-3298": {
    "Description": "The TIOCGICOUNT device ioctl in the hso.c driver allows unprivileged users to read 9 bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the reserved member of the serial_icounter_struct struct declared on the stack in hso_get_count() is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user.",
    "Root cause": "The `reserved` member of the `serial_icounter_struct` structure was not initialized before being copied to user space.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure through Uninitialized Data"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can read 9 bytes of uninitialized kernel stack memory, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access via TIOCGICOUNT ioctl on the hso.c driver"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Local user with the ability to use the TIOCGICOUNT ioctl on the hso device."
    ],
  }
