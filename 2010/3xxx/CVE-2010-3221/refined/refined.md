Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-3221:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Word handles a malformed record while parsing a specially crafted Word file.

**Weakness:**
- Improper handling of a malformed record in the parsing process of specially crafted Word files

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user. This means that if the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the system.
- An attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Word file. This can happen through:
  - **Email:** An attacker sends the malicious file as an attachment.
  - **Web:** An attacker hosts the file on a website, and the user is convinced to download and open the file.
- Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content can also be used to distribute malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted malicious Word file.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the file to the target user, either through email or by hosting it on a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the target user to open the crafted Word document.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Software:**
- Microsoft Word 2002 SP3
- Microsoft Word 2003 SP3
- Microsoft Word Viewer

**Mitigation:**
- The primary recommendation to mitigate the risk is to avoid opening Word documents from untrusted sources.
- Applying the security update provided by Microsoft addresses the vulnerability.
