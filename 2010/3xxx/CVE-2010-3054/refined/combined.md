manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
efficiently. The freetype packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 provide
both the FreeType 1 and FreeType 2 font engines.

It was discovered that the FreeType font rendering engine improperly
validated certain position values when processing input streams. If a user
loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against
FreeType, and the relevant font glyphs were subsequently rendered with the
X FreeType library (libXft), it could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow
in the libXft library, causing the application to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2010-3311)

An array index error was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed certain PostScript Type 42 font files. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2010-2806)

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed PostScript Type 1 font files that contain nested Standard
Encoding Accented Character (seac) calls. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-3054)

Note: All of the issues in this erratum only affect the FreeType 2 font
engine.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted
(log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0737)

## Topic

Updated freetype packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

FreeType is a free, high-quality, portable font engine that can open and
manage font files. It also loads, hints, and renders individual glyphs
efficiently. The freetype packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 provide
both the FreeType 1 and FreeType 2 font engines. The freetype packages for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 provide only the FreeType 2 font engine.

It was discovered that the FreeType font rendering engine improperly
validated certain position values when processing input streams. If a user
loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against
FreeType, and the relevant font glyphs were subsequently rendered with the
X FreeType library (libXft), it could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow
in the libXft library, causing the application to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2010-3311)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font
rendering engine processed some PostScript Type 1 fonts. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2010-2808)

An array index error was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed certain PostScript Type 42 font files. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2010-2806)

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way the FreeType font rendering
engine processed PostScript Type 1 font files that contain nested Standard
Encoding Accented Character (seac) calls. If a user loaded a
specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, it
could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-3054)

Note: All of the issues in this erratum only affect the FreeType 2 font
engine.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. The X server must be restarted
(log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
