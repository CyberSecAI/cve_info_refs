  "CVE-2010-3054": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is in the FreeType library, specifically related to how it processes nested Standard Encoding Accented Character (seac) calls within PostScript Type 1 font files.",
    "root_cause": "A stack overflow vulnerability occurs because the FreeType library does not properly handle nested 'seac' calls when parsing PostScript Type 1 fonts. This can lead to uncontrolled recursion and excessive stack usage.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution on the system.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Loading a specially crafted PostScript Type 1 font file that contains nested 'seac' calls."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted font file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of FreeType."
