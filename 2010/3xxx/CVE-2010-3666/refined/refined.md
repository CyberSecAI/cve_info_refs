The advisory notes a fix for this. The advisory states that TYPO3's own `t3lib_div::generateRandomBytes()` function was improved to enhance randomness, particularly on Windows systems, and is now used instead of PHP's `uniqid()` for session ID generation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insecure randomness in the generation of session IDs using `uniqid()`.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability could potentially lead to session hijacking, as session IDs could be predicted with sufficient effort.\n\n**Attack vectors:** This is a network based attack.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with the ability to observe or predict the output of the `uniqid()` function.  \n\nThe content provides extensive details, specifying that the issue is not only in PHP's `uniqid()` function but also how TYPO3 handled random bytes generation, which was particularly problematic in windows systems. It details the specific fix for the issue.",
