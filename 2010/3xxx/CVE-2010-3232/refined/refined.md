      "text": "## Excel File Format Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3232\n\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\nTo view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-3232](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3232).\n\n#### Mitigating Factors for Excel File Format Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3232\n\nMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:\n\n*   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.\n*   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n*   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.\n\n#### Workarounds for Excel File Format Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3232\n\nWorkaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:\n\n*   **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the** **opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**\n\n    The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.\n\n    **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.\n\n    **For Office 2003**\n\n    ```\n    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Excel\\Security\\FileOpenBlock]\n\n    \"BinaryFiles\"=dword:00000001\n\n    ```\n\n    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.\n\n    **For Office 2007**\n\n    ```\n    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Excel\\Security\\FileOpenBlock]\n\n    \"BinaryFiles\"=dword:00000001\n\n    ```\n\n    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, all of the latest security updates for the 2007 Microsoft Office system must be applied.\n\n    **Impact of workaround.** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special \"exempt directory\" as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or Office 2007.\n\n    **How to undo the workaround.**\n\n    For Office 2003\n\n    ```\n    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Excel\\Security\\FileOpenBlock]\n\n    \"BinaryFiles\"=dword:00000000\n\n    ```\n\n    For Office 2007\n\n    ```\n    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Excel\\Security\\FileOpenBlock]\n\n    \"BinaryFiles\"=dword:00000000\n\n    ```\n*   **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**\n\n    The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.\n\n    To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.\n\n    To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:\n\n    [Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)\n\n    MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:\n\n    [https:](https://)\n\n    **Enable MOICE**\n\n    **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.\n\n    To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.\n\n    | Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler |\n| --- |\n| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\\ ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document |\n| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\\ ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet\\ ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template\\ ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin |\n| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\\ ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show\\ ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template\\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow |\n\n    **Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.\n\n    For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).\n\n    **Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.\n\n    **How to undo the workaround.** Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.\n\n    | Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |\n| --- |\n| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\\ ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8 |\n| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\\ ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8\\ ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template\\ ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |\n| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\\ ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8\\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow\\ ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8 |\n\n    **Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.\n*   **Do not open Microsoft Office files from untrusted sources**\n\n    Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources.
