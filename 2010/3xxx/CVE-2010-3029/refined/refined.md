  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the 'gameday' parameter in the 'statistics.php' script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability in the 'gameday' parameter of 'statistics.php'.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information such as usernames and password hashes. In the provided exploit, it is used to extract the username and password hash of the user with ID 1 from the `kick_user` table.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the 'statistics.php' script, with a crafted 'gameday' parameter containing SQL injection payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges or specific position within the network are required."
