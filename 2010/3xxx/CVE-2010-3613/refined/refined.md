Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-3613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from BIND's improper handling of cached RRSIG records in conjunction with NCACHE (negative cache) records. Specifically, when a negative response (indicating no data exists) is cached, existing RRSIG records for the same entry are not invalidated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Cache Invalidation:** The core issue is the failure to clear or invalidate related RRSIG records when an NCACHE record is added to the DNS cache.
- **Lack of Synchronization:**  There appears to be a lack of synchronization or proper handling between the negative cache and the DNSSEC signature records within the cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition.
- **Server Crash:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the BIND `named` server. This happens when a subsequent lookup of the cached data triggers an error due to the inconsistent state between the RRSIG and NCACHE records.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker.
- **Recursive DNS Queries:**  The attack requires the ability to send recursive DNS queries to the vulnerable BIND server.
- **Specially Prepared Zone:** The attack often involves requesting information about a specially crafted or prepared DNS zone that is not hosted on the same nameserver. This allows the attacker to control the negative response and cached data.
- **DNS Client Authorized for Recursion**: The attacker needs to use a DNS client authorized to use the vulnerable nameserver for recursion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the target DNS server and the ability to send DNS queries.
- **Recursive Query Capability:** The attacker must be able to send recursive queries to the target nameserver.
- **DNS Knowledge:** Some knowledge of DNS, DNSSEC and the ability to craft responses or create a suitable zone is needed for a successful exploit.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any credentials.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects recursive nameservers, regardless of whether DNSSEC validation is enabled or disabled.
- Some sources mention that this was reported by the Internet Systems Consortium.
- Affected software versions include BIND versions 9.3, 9.4, 9.6, and 9.7 before specific patch levels.
- Patches and workarounds include upgrading BIND packages to specific versions.
- Multiple vendors are affected, including HP-UX, Avaya, NetBSD, Slackware, VMware, Debian, and Ubuntu.
- The vulnerability is often associated with CVE-2010-3614 and CVE-2010-3762, which are other BIND vulnerabilities that have been fixed in the same updates.
