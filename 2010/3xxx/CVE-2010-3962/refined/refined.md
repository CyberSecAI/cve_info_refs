Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-3962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an uninitialized memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer. This arises when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uninitialized Memory Access**: The primary weakness lies in the improper handling of object initialization in memory. Internet Explorer does not validate or handle cases where it attempts to access memory associated with objects that have not been correctly initialized or have already been deleted. This leads to predictable memory corruption.
- **VTable Overwrite**: In the context of CSS parsing, a specific combination of tags can cause Internet Explorer to under-allocate memory, leading to overwriting the least significant byte of a vtable pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user running the vulnerable Internet Explorer instance.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker gains the same privileges as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious web pages designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Existing, compromised websites can be injected with exploit code, affecting users who browse them.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers may convince a user to visit malicious websites through links in emails or instant messages.
- **Malicious Office documents:** The vulnerability can be exploited by convincing users to open malicious Word documents. The exploit would be triggered when closing the document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host/Distribute Malicious Content:** Attackers need to host a crafted web page or distribute a malicious file (e.g., via email) to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince the user to view the malicious web page, open a malicious attachment or document.
- **Targeted Browsing:** The attack requires that a user be logged on and using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2010-3962.
- Microsoft was aware of active attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.
- Microsoft provided a security update in bulletin MS10-090 to address the issue.
- Workarounds are available but may cause reduced functionality, such as disabling scripting or using plain text mode for emails. Microsoft recommends reversing some of the workarounds before applying the security update.
- Data Execution Prevention (DEP) helps protect against attacks that result in code execution and is enabled by default in Internet Explorer 8 on certain Windows operating systems.

The provided content from multiple sources consistently describes the core nature of the vulnerability as memory corruption due to improper object initialization, leading to potential remote code execution. The exploit examples provided on Exploit-DB confirm this by demonstrating code which when executed by the browser leads to memory corruption. The other sources (Microsoft Security Bulletin, CERT vulnerability note) confirm the vulnerability and provide further analysis, workarounds and update information.
