  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Red Hat/Dogtag Certificate System did not prevent the reuse of one-time PINs in SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) requests. The system checked for PIN validity but did not remove it from the list of valid PINs after use.",

      "One-time PIN reuse vulnerability"
