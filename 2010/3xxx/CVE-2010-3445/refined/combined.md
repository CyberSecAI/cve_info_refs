How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## CVE-2010-3445: Wireshark ASN.1 BER Stack Overflow

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/cve-2010-3445-wireshark-asn-1-ber-stack-overflow/#respond)

This vulnerability was discovered by The Penetration Test Team of NCNIPC as we can read in the official [security advisory](http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2010-11.html) and it affects Wireshark 1.2 up to (and including) 1.2.11 and 1.4.0. The bug was reported on 13 September 2010 at the BugTraq mailing list as you can see [here](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2010/Sep/87).

Here is the susceptible function which is available at epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c

```

int dissect_unknown_ber(packet_info *pinfo, tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset, proto_tree *tree)
{
        int start_offset;
        gint8 class;
        gboolean pc, ind;
        gint32 tag;
        guint32 len;
        int hdr_len;
        proto_item *item=NULL;
        proto_tree *next_tree=NULL;
        guint8 c;
        guint32 i;
        gboolean is_printable;
        proto_item *pi, *cause;
        asn1_ctx_t asn1_ctx;

```

This function is called when an unknown ASN.1 BER encoded content is encountered in a packet. The Penetration Test Team of NCNIPC triggered this through an SNMPv1 packet’s variable bindings item. Back to dissect\_unknown\_ber()’s code we can read the following…

```

/* we dont care about the class only on the constructor flag */
        switch(pc){

        case FALSE: /* this is not constructed */

          switch(class) { /* we do care about the class */
     ...
                case BER_UNI_TAG_OCTETSTRING:
                        if (decode_octetstring_as_ber) {
     ...
                                if (pc && (ber_len + (ber_offset - offset) == len)) {
                                        /* Decoded a constructed ASN.1 tag with a length indicating this
                                         * could be BER encoded data.  Try dissecting as unknown BER.
                                         */
                                        if (show_internal_ber_fields) {
     ...
                                        offset = dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, next_tree);
                                } else {

```

So, in case of a message with no constructor flag set, it will fall into the above ‘switch’ statement. If this is has a class of ‘BER\_UNI\_TAG\_OCTETSTRING’ it will enter this case. In this code, if it’s able to detect a possible BER encoded data section and ‘show\_internal\_ber\_fields’ allows it, it will recursively invoke dissect\_unknown\_ber().

A similar recursion also appears in the case of a set constructor flag as you can read here:

```

        case TRUE: /* this is constructed */
     ...
          switch(class) {
          case BER_CLASS_UNI:
            item=proto_tree_add_text(tree, tvb, offset, len, "%s", val_to_str(tag,ber_uni_tag_codes,"Unknown"));
                if(item){
                        next_tree=proto_item_add_subtree(item, ett_ber_SEQUENCE);
                }
                while(offset < (int)(start_offset + len + hdr_len))
                  offset=dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, next_tree);
                break;
     ...
        return offset;
}

```

The bug here is that a malicious user can construct a packet with an unknown ASN.1/BER encoded message in order to trigger this recursion. For example, if the variable bindings’ item in the SNMP PDU is set to some huge value, this function will be recursively invoked so many times that it’ll eventually consume so much stack memory’s space that will lead to a stack overflow.

In order to fix this, Wireshark’s developers developed and applied [the following patch](http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc/trunk/epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c?r1=34111&r2=34110&pathrev=34111)…

```

+/*
+ * Set a limit on recursion so we don't blow away the stack. Another approach
+ * would be to remove recursion completely but then we'd exhaust CPU+memory
+ * trying to read a hellabyte of nested indefinite lengths.
+ * XXX - Max nesting in the ASN.1 plugin is 32. Should they match?
+ */
+#define BER_MAX_NESTING 500
+

```

So, the comment is pretty clear here. I won’t add anything else. Also, the buggy routine dissect\_unknown\_ber() was renamed and a new argument was added…

```

-int dissect_unknown_ber(packet_info *pinfo, tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset, proto_tree *tree)
+static int
+try_dissect_unknown_ber(packet_info *pinfo, tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset, proto_tree *tree, gint nest_level)
 {
 	int start_offset;

```

Its new argument ‘nest\_level’ which is used as a recursion counter that will check during the beginning of this routine if it has passed the maximum number of iterations like this:

```

 	asn1_ctx_t asn1_ctx;

+	if (nest_level > BER_MAX_NESTING) {
+		/* Assume that we have a malformed packet. */
+		THROW(ReportedBoundsError);
+	}
+
 	start_offset=offset;

```

Of course, the various calls to the previous dissect\_unknown\_ber() were changed to match the new function and its arguments like this:

```

-		offset = dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, next_tree);
+		offset = try_dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, next_tree, nest_level+1);
 	      }

```

And for compatibility purposes, a wrapper routine named dissect\_unknown\_ber() was created.

```

+int
+dissect_unknown_ber(packet_info *pinfo, tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset, proto_tree *tree)
+{
+	return try_dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, tree, 1);
+}

```

The old constant ‘BER\_MAX\_INDEFINITE\_NESTING’ was removed since the new ‘BER\_MAX\_NESTING’ is used now…

```

-/*
- * Set a limit on recursion so we don't blow away the stack. Another approach
- * would be to remove recursion completely but then we'd exhaust CPU+memory
- * trying to read a hellabyte of nested indefinite lengths.
- * XXX - Max nesting in the ASN.1 plugin is 32. Should they match?
- */
-#define BER_MAX_INDEFINITE_NESTING 500

```

And try\_get\_ber\_length() was changed to use this new constant value.

```

-	if (nest_level > BER_MAX_INDEFINITE_NESTING) {
+	if (nest_level > BER_MAX_NESTING) {
 		/* Assume that we have a malformed packet. */

```

In the Wireshark Bug Database we can also find a PCAP capture file that can be used to trigger the vulnerability. You can download ‘ber\_unknown\_overflow.pcap’ [here](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=5173). You can make a DoS exploit code pretty fast using this capture file. Here is a more detailed representation of its contents (from the UDP datagram and below)…

```

----- UDP -----
SOURCE PORT:	1070 (gmrupdateserv)
DEST.  PORT:	161  (SNMP)
LENGTH     :    12049
CHECKSUM   :	0x7634 (CORRECT)

```

And the SNMP packet sent using the above datagram is the following…

```

----- SNMP -----
VERSION    :	version-1 (0)
COMMUNITY  :	PUBLIC
DATA	   :    get-request
get-request:
	     request-id  :   	4121
	     error-status:   	noError (0)
	     error-index :      0
             variable-bindings: 1 item

```

This item in variable bindings of the packet is simply a sequence of the following data:

```

0x30, 0x82, 0x2e, 0xe4, 0x06, 0x00
"a" x 12000

```

Wireshark recognizes the initial sequence of bytes as primitive encoded value with sequence OID of 3158140172 (which is also indicated as a malformed OID). Then, it will continue having nested applications as far as your stack can hold :P

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Great.  Thank you for the information, Gerald.  That is very helpful.

## [BSidesBUD 2023: A Deeper Look at the Disrupted Bot Farms in Ukraine](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/02/bsidesbud-2023-a-deeper-look-at-the-disrupted-bot-farms-in-ukraine/)

It would probably take us many years to look into all the intricate details of the countless cyber operations that are taking place globally in relation to the Ukraine/Russia conflict the last couple of years. As a tiny step towards that direction, in 2023 I did some research on how Russian intelligence services have been setting up and utilising “bot farms” inside Ukraine.

Eventually, I was accepted to present this research at BSidesBUD 2023. A really nice event at the capital of Hungary that I’d definitely recommend to everyone from our industry.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsidesbud_2023.jpg?w=1024)

In case you want to get an idea of the content, below I’m attaching the slides that I used. However, the slides were mostly to support my presentation so they do not have that much value on their own. Nevertheless, it was a subject that I hadn’t come across in any security conference before, so I thought it’s worth documenting for future reference.

## [Kaspersky SAS ’23](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/kaspersky-sas-23/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/kaspersky-sas-23/#respond)

I’m always seeking to learn and experience different cyber security events since each one of them gives you a different perspective of our industry (and the world), and Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS), was in my “*to do*” list for a long time.

I planned to attend SAS in 2018-2019 but due to some competing priorities, I couldn’t. Then, in 2020 I applied to do a presentation titled “cyber-crime ecosystem in the travel industry” which was accepted, but the conference was cancelled due to the pandemic, and in 2023 it was the first time since the pandemic that SAS was back. So, after 5 years, I finally managed to attend the SAS ’23 which took place in Phuket, Thailand and was a wonderful, small, security conference.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1.png?w=1024)

It was a relatively small event with a couple of hundred of people or so. But the content was incredible. From all sorts of APTs that you rarely hear about, to innovative research, and of course having the ability network and chat with professionals from national CERTs as well as security researchers from countries rarely present in the well-known US and European cyber security events, with a truly amazing organisation, lots of activities and surprises.

As security professionals it’s imperative that we understand the threat landscape globally, and this event was a remarkable place to gain that insight for anyone coming from US or EU background. Both from the defenders and the attackers’ perspective, the event included very interesting TTPs and content that I hadn’t seen before.

Lastly, as Eugene Kaspersky put it in one of the conference activities, a great security conference needs to have: 1) new and innovative security research/content; 2) be hosted in a nice environment/location that allows people to disconnect from their day-to-day work; and 3) be fun. SAS ’23 managed to cover all three areas successfully.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sas23.jpg?w=1024)

It’s hard to choose my favourite talks from this event, but if I had to pick 5 (in no particular order), based on the knowledge I acquired from them, those would be:

* **StripedFly: Traversing the Blue Expanse in Search of Eternal Wonders**
  + by Sergey Belov and Sergey Lozhkin (Kaspersky GReAT)
* **How Many Gates to the Temple of Space? Shapes of Tunnels Drilled by Desecrators**
  + by Askar Dyussekeyev (KZ-CERT)
* **Unearthing TetrisPhantom: Discovering secrets of an intricate cyber threat campaign**
  + by Noushin Shabab (Kaspersky GReAT)
* **Operation Triangulation: Сonnecting the Dots**
  + by Igor Kuznetsov (Kaspersky)
* **Space Pirates: raiders of privacy**
  + by Denis Kuvshinov (Positive Technologies)

## [2022 CTI-EU Talk: Threat Landscape and Defences Against Mobile Surveillance Implants](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/2022-cti-eu-talk-threat-landscape-and-defences-against-mobile-surveillance-implants/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/2022-cti-eu-talk-threat-landscape-and-defences-against-mobile-surveillance-implants/#respond)

In December 2022 I had a very pleasant surprise, I was given an opportunity to give a lightning talk at the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) conference of 2022, known as **CTI-EU 2022**. I had attended previous editions of this event and it was an amazing experience, so having that opportunity was a great honour.

I had a few different topics that I was researching around that time and after a small discussion with the organisers we agreed that the best option would be the “Threat Landscape and Defences Against Mobile Surveillance Implants”.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.png?w=800)

If you’d like to see what other presentations took place during the CTI-EU 2022, check out the [published agenda](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2022-cti-eu-conference-1/enisa-cti-eu-conference-agenda.pdf) for the event. There were some very valuable presentations, but of course, being an on-site event, the most important part was the face-to-face interactions. With this event ENISA manages to bring public and private sector CTI experts together and we had numerous fruitful conversations ranging from CTI topics, to public/private sector collaborations, challenges, and more.

I’m not sure if/when ENISA will publish the slides from the TLP:WHITE talks, but if you’d like to see mine you can get them here. Apparently, being a lightning talk I couldn’t go in-depth in almost anything, but if you are interested in something mentioned in my slides (but with more depth), please contact me. Additionally, if you are researching this space and would like a second pair of eyes, I’d be more than happy to help.

## [OSINT: A Summary of SIDEWINDER Operations in 2022](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/osint-a-summary-of-sidewinder-operations-in-2022/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/osint-a-summary-of-sidewinder-operations-in-2022/#respond)

SIDEWINDER (also known as RAZOR TIGER, RATTLESNAKE, T-APT-04, HARDCORE NATIONALIST, and APT-C-17) is a cyber espionage actor who has been active at least since 2012. I had a look on all the publicly known 2022 operations (that I could find) attributed to this actor to derive some insights and here’s the outcome.

The main outcome we can derive is that SIDEWINDER is focusing mainly on Pakistani military targets (particularly the Navy) to conduct cyber espionage.

In terms of the data I used, through publicly available information I found 40 unique events (let’s call them operations) for the period of January 2022-December 2022 and here are some statistics…

**Note**: Apparently this is a tiny number compared to [Kaspersky’s](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/sidewinder-hackers-launched-over-1000.html) “*over 1,000 new attacks since April 2020*” but I tried to keep it limited to 2022, publicly available reports, and only those that had some context. Not just IOCs.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_target_countries.jpg?w=851)

*Figure 1: Countries targeted by SIDEWINDER*

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_targeted_sectors.jpg?w=769)

*Figure 2: Sectors targeted by SIDEWINDER*

Many identify SIDEWINDER as an Indian cyber espionage actor and based on the targets of *Figure 1* and *Figure 2* I’d say that we can safely assume that their main target is Pakistani military entities which makes this actor better aligned with what a military intelligence agency would be performing. Maybe something like India’s [Directorate of Military Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Military_Intelligence_%28India%29)? Apparently, there are no hard evidence here to be certain about this, just some food for thought.

Considering the main target is the Pakistani military, here’s a breakdown of the specific SIDEWINDER targets in Pakistan from the limited 2022 dataset I mentioned in the introduction.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_breakdown_of_pakistani_targets.jpg?w=976)

*Figure 3: Volumetric analysis of top SIDEWINDER targets in Pakistan*

Based on that limited dataset, clearly the Pakistani Navy was by far the top target of SIDEWINDER for 2022, strengthening the hypothesis of SIDEWINDER being an actor associated with India’s military intelligence, or even naval intelligence.

With such small sample sets, timelines aren’t particularly valuable but I know that people will be asking for it so here is a timeline analysis too.

## [BSides Cyprus: Cloud… Just somebody else’s computer](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/bsides-cyprus-cloud-just-somebody-elses-computer/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/bsides-cyprus-cloud-just-somebody-elses-computer/#respond)

Just noticed that I haven’t published much for the last few talks I’ve been giving and this is one of them…

That was my 8th, and last, talk for 2021. It was a research more on the cloud security architect/engineering side. That was my second time participating in [BSides Cyprus](https://twitter.com/BsidesCyprus), and as always, it was an amazing event with amazing people. The organizers of BSides Cyprus did a remarkable job. From the set up of the remote event, to the CTF, the prizes for the CTF participants, and the overall atmosphere, it was an excellent event.

Now specifically on my talk, that was a subject that I was preparing for around a year and I’m glad I got to talk about it in BSides Cyprus. For various reasons, public cloud providers are intentionally abstracting lots of the plumbing on how everything is put together and how does this affect security.

So, in this talk I picked up a few services from AWS, GCP, and Azure and dissected them to demonstrate that:

* It’s just computers and software under the hood
* How having this “inner” architectural understanding helps you uncover vulnerabilities (using some publicly available ones in the examples, no 0days or embargoed issues revealed)

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bsidescyprus21.jpg?w=1024)

My goal with this talk wasn’t to uncover some significant design flaw or claim that public cloud is bad. Just to raise awareness and change the mindset of security engineers when working with public cloud to think beyond what the vendor’s documentation says. If you’d like to have a look, you can find my [slides here](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cloud...-just-somebody-elses-computer.pdf).

Package        : wireshark
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3445

A flaw has been found in wireshark, a network protocol analyzer.

It was found that the ASN.1 BER dissector was susceptible to a stack
overflow, causing the application to crash.

For the stable distribution (lenny), the problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-3+lenny11.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.11-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- finch/pidgin
A NULL pointer dereference DoS has been fixed in pidgin.
CVE-2010-4528 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- libmoon-devel/moonlight-plugin
Untrusted Moonlight apps could bypass constraints on methods which
potentially allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-4254).
Affected products: SLE11-SP1
- libsmi
This update fixes a buffer overflow the smiGetNode() function in libsmi.
It allowed context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via an
Object Identifier.
CVE-2010-2891: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH)
(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P): Buffer Errors (CWE-119)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- openssl
Malicious clients could downgrade a connection to a low strength cipher
suite on session resumption if the server offers such ciphers
(CVE-2010-4180).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3, SLE11-SP1
- perl-CGI-Simple
A HTTP header injection attack was fixed in perl-CGI-Simple.
CVE-2010-2761 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- supportutils
the supportconfig script did not disguise passwords in the config files
it collected (CVE-2010-3912).
Affected products: SLE11-SP1, SLE10-SP3
- wireshark
Wireshark version 1.4.2 fixes several security issues that allowed
attackers to crash wireshark or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-1455, CVE-2010-2283, CVE-2010-2284, CVE-2010-2285,
CVE-2010-2286, CVE-2010-2287, CVE-2010-2992, CVE-2010-2993,
CVE-2010-2994, CVE-2010-2995, CVE-2010-3445, CVE-2010-4300,

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/cve-2010-3445-wireshark-asn-1-ber-stack-overflow/#respond)

This vulnerability was discovered by The Penetration Test Team of NCNIPC as we can read in the official [security advisory](http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2010-11.html) and it affects Wireshark 1.2 up to (and including) 1.2.11 and 1.4.0. The bug was reported on 13 September 2010 at the BugTraq mailing list as you can see [here](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2010/Sep/87).

Here is the susceptible function which is available at epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c

        guint32 i;
        gboolean is_printable;
        proto_item *pi, *cause;
        asn1_ctx_t asn1_ctx;

```

This function is called when an unknown ASN.1 BER encoded content is encountered in a packet. The Penetration Test Team of NCNIPC triggered this through an SNMPv1 packet’s variable bindings item. Back to dissect\_unknown\_ber()’s code we can read the following…

```

/* we dont care about the class only on the constructor flag */
        switch(pc){

        case FALSE: /* this is not constructed */

          switch(class) { /* we do care about the class */
     ...
                case BER_UNI_TAG_OCTETSTRING:
                        if (decode_octetstring_as_ber) {
     ...
                                if (pc && (ber_len + (ber_offset - offset) == len)) {
                                        /* Decoded a constructed ASN.1 tag with a length indicating this
                                         * could be BER encoded data.  Try dissecting as unknown BER.
                                         */
                                        if (show_internal_ber_fields) {
     ...
                                        offset = dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, next_tree);
                                } else {

```

So, in case of a message with no constructor flag set, it will fall into the above ‘switch’ statement. If this is has a class of ‘BER\_UNI\_TAG\_OCTETSTRING’ it will enter this case. In this code, if it’s able to detect a possible BER encoded data section and ‘show\_internal\_ber\_fields’ allows it, it will recursively invoke dissect\_unknown\_ber().

A similar recursion also appears in the case of a set constructor flag as you can read here:

```

        case TRUE: /* this is constructed */
     ...
          switch(class) {
          case BER_CLASS_UNI:
            item=proto_tree_add_text(tree, tvb, offset, len, "%s", val_to_str(tag,ber_uni_tag_codes,"Unknown"));
                if(item){
                        next_tree=proto_item_add_subtree(item, ett_ber_SEQUENCE);
                }
                while(offset < (int)(start_offset + len + hdr_len))
                  offset=dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, next_tree);
                break;
     ...
        return offset;
}

```

The bug here is that a malicious user can construct a packet with an unknown ASN.1/BER encoded message in order to trigger this recursion. For example, if the variable bindings’ item in the SNMP PDU is set to some huge value, this function will be recursively invoked so many times that it’ll eventually consume so much stack memory’s space that will lead to a stack overflow.

In order to fix this, Wireshark’s developers developed and applied [the following patch](http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc/trunk/epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c?r1=34111&r2=34110&pathrev=34111)…

```

+/*
+ * Set a limit on recursion so we don't blow away the stack. Another approach
+ * would be to remove recursion completely but then we'd exhaust CPU+memory
+ * trying to read a hellabyte of nested indefinite lengths.
+ * XXX - Max nesting in the ASN.1 plugin is 32. Should they match?
+ */
+#define BER_MAX_NESTING 500
+

```

So, the comment is pretty clear here. I won’t add anything else. Also, the buggy routine dissect\_unknown\_ber() was renamed and a new argument was added…

```

-int dissect_unknown_ber(packet_info *pinfo, tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset, proto_tree *tree)
+static int
+try_dissect_unknown_ber(packet_info *pinfo, tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset, proto_tree *tree, gint nest_level)
 {
 	int start_offset;

```

Its new argument ‘nest\_level’ which is used as a recursion counter that will check during the beginning of this routine if it has passed the maximum number of iterations like this:

```

 	asn1_ctx_t asn1_ctx;

+	if (nest_level > BER_MAX_NESTING) {
+		/* Assume that we have a malformed packet. */
+		THROW(ReportedBoundsError);
+	}
+
 	start_offset=offset;

```

Of course, the various calls to the previous dissect\_unknown\_ber() were changed to match the new function and its arguments like this:

```

-		offset = dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, next_tree);
+		offset = try_dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, next_tree, nest_level+1);
 	      }

```

And for compatibility purposes, a wrapper routine named dissect\_unknown\_ber() was created.

```

+int
+dissect_unknown_ber(packet_info *pinfo, tvbuff_t *tvb, int offset, proto_tree *tree)
+{
+	return try_dissect_unknown_ber(pinfo, tvb, offset, tree, 1);
+}

```

The old constant ‘BER\_MAX\_INDEFINITE\_NESTING’ was removed since the new ‘BER\_MAX\_NESTING’ is used now…

```

-/*
- * Set a limit on recursion so we don't blow away the stack. Another approach
- * would be to remove recursion completely but then we'd exhaust CPU+memory
- * trying to read a hellabyte of nested indefinite lengths.
- * XXX - Max nesting in the ASN.1 plugin is 32. Should they match?
- */
-#define BER_MAX_INDEFINITE_NESTING 500

```

And try\_get\_ber\_length() was changed to use this new constant value.

```

-	if (nest_level > BER_MAX_INDEFINITE_NESTING) {
+	if (nest_level > BER_MAX_NESTING) {
 		/* Assume that we have a malformed packet. */

```

In the Wireshark Bug Database we can also find a PCAP capture file that can be used to trigger the vulnerability. You can download ‘ber\_unknown\_overflow.pcap’ [here](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=5173). You can make a DoS exploit code pretty fast using this capture file. Here is a more detailed representation of its contents (from the UDP datagram and below)…

```

----- UDP -----
SOURCE PORT:	1070 (gmrupdateserv)
DEST.  PORT:	161  (SNMP)
LENGTH     :    12049
CHECKSUM   :	0x7634 (CORRECT)

```

And the SNMP packet sent using the above datagram is the following…

```

----- SNMP -----
VERSION    :	version-1 (0)
COMMUNITY  :	PUBLIC
DATA	   :    get-request
get-request:
	     request-id  :   	4121
	     error-status:   	noError (0)
	     error-index :      0
             variable-bindings: 1 item

```

This item in variable bindings of the packet is simply a sequence of the following data:

```

0x30, 0x82, 0x2e, 0xe4, 0x06, 0x00
"a" x 12000

```

Wireshark recognizes the initial sequence of bytes as primitive encoded value with sequence OID of 3158140172 (which is also indicated as a malformed OID). Then, it will continue having nested applications as far as your stack can hold :P

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=639486#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-01 21:46:20 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that all of the BER dissectors in Wireshark were vulnerable to a stack overflow, which would cause Wireshark to crash.  The upstream bugzilla [2] includes a capture file that triggers the recursion in dissect_ber_unknown() to demonstrate the flaw.  This has been corrected upstream [3] and is scheduled to be included in the forthcoming 1.4.1 and 1.2.12 releases.  [1] <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2010-09/0088.html> [2] <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5230> [3] <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=34111>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=639486#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-12 15:14:07 UTC  ``` Wireshark 1.2.12 is now available:  <http://www.wireshark.org/docs/relnotes/wireshark-1.2.12.html> <http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2010-11.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=639486#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-30 18:32:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2010:0924 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0924.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=639486#c5)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-30 18:52:56 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update to wireshark in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 may address this flaw.

## Wireshark 6LoWPAN denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#215900

Original Release Date: 2011-03-02 | Last Revised: 2011-03-29

---

### Overview

Wireshark will crash on 32-bit systems while reading a malformed 6LoWPAN packet.

### Description

| Paul Makowski's report states:  *dissect\_6lowpan\_iphc()* *in* */epan/dissectors/packet-6lowpan.c* *trusts user supplied data when incrementing '**offset**'. It is possible for the user to increment '**offset**' to a value greater than* *tvb->length* *and/or* *tvb->reported\_length**, forcing the dissector to attempt dissection out of bounds. If '**offset**' is greater than* *tvb->length* *or* *tvb->reported\_length**, then* *tvb\_length\_remaining()* *or* *tvb\_reported\_length\_remaining()* *will return -1 respectively. If* *tvb\_length\_remaining()* *returns -1, then a buffer is allocated 1 byte too short, leading to a partial overwrite of the heap canary.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may trigger a denial of service, causing any active capture or .pcap dissection to crash Wireshark/tshark. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Upgrade to Wireshark 1.4.4. Several other security related fixes are also included in this version. |
| --- |

## wnpa-sec-2010-12 · ASN.1 BER vulnerability in Wireshark

## Summary

**Name:** ASN.1 BER vulnerability in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2010-12

**Date:** October 11, 2010

**Affected versions:** 1.4.0

**Fixed versions:** 1.4.1

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.4.1 fixes the following vulnerability:

* The Penetration Test Team of NCNIPC (China) discovered that the
  ASN.1 BER dissector was susceptible to a stack overflow.

  (Bug
  5230)
  Versions affected: All previous versions up to and including
  1.2.11 and 1.4.0.
  [CVE-2010-3445](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3445)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a series of malformed
packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.4.1 or later.
Due to the nature of these bugs we do not recommend trying to work around the
problem by disabling dissectors.
