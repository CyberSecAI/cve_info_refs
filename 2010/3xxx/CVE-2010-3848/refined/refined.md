{
  "CVE-2010-3848": {
    "Root cause": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `econet_sendmsg` function due to a large number of iovec structures.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient input validation of user-controlled `msg->msg_iovlen` leading to allocation of excessive memory on the stack."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation. By overflowing the kernel stack, an attacker can clobber the 'struct thread_info' and gain control over the kernel execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker with the ability to send messages via the Econet protocol.",
    "Required capabilities": "Local user with the ability to configure an Econet address and send messages using the Econet protocol."
  },
    "CVE-2010-3849": {
    "Root cause": "NULL pointer dereference in the `econet_sendmsg` function when a NULL value is provided for the remote address field.",
    "Weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Missing check for a NULL remote address value before dereferencing it."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS).",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker sending messages via the Econet protocol with a NULL remote address.",
    "Required capabilities": "Local user with the ability to configure an Econet address and send messages using the Econet protocol."
  },
    "CVE-2010-3850": {
    "Root cause": "Missing capability check in `ec_dev_ioctl` function for SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing access control check",
        "The `ec_dev_ioctl` function does not enforce `CAP_NET_ADMIN` when configuring Econet addresses through the `SIOCSIFADDR` ioctl."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can bypass intended access restrictions and configure Econet addresses, potentially enabling exploitation of other Econet vulnerabilities.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker using the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.",
        "Required capabilities": "Local user with the ability to make ioctl calls."
