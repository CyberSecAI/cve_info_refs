{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `index.php` script due to the `img` parameter being directly inserted into a SQL query without sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data disclosure, modification, or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL with the `img` parameter containing malicious SQL code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required."
