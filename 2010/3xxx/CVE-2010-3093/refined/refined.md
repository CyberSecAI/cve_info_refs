Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2010-3093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Drupal comment module. Specifically, there's a privilege escalation issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The core weakness is that certain users can bypass limitations within the comment module. This suggests that the access control or permission checks for comment unpublishing were either incorrect or insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is that an attacker with limited privileges can bypass intended restrictions related to comment unpublishing. This would allow the attacker to manage comments in a way they were not intended to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector would involve leveraging the vulnerable comment module by interacting with the unpublishing functionality. This can occur through the web interface or potentially via API calls if available.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have some level of access to the Drupal system, specifically an account that can interact with the comment module.
*   They do not need to be an administrator.
*   They need to know about the vulnerability and where the affected functionality is located.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text is brief. It does not specify the exact technical details of how the privilege escalation works (e.g., a specific function or code logic error).
*   It mentions that the issue was fixed in Drupal version 6.6-3lenny6 for Debian Lenny and 6.18-1 for Debian Squeeze and Sid.
