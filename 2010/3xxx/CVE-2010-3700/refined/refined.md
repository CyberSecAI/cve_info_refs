Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the Apache Bugzilla entry, which relates to CVE-2010-3700 based on the affected component:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is how `CoyoteAdapter` in Apache Tomcat 5 handles path information, specifically when path parameters (using semicolons `;`) are present in the URL. The `CoyoteAdapter`'s `postParseRequest()` method truncates the path at the first semicolon, incorrectly removing path information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Path Parsing:** The `CoyoteAdapter` incorrectly parses the request path, specifically when path parameters are present, by truncating the path at the first semicolon. This is contrary to RFC1738, which allows parameters within the path.
*   **Deviation from Specification:** The behavior deviates from the Servlet Specification, which suggests that `getPathInfo()` should include path parameters. The code was not fully compliant with the specification at the time of the bug report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Path Information:** Applications relying on `getPathInfo()` to retrieve the complete path information, including the parameters, will receive an incomplete path, which would cause the application to malfunction.
*   **Incorrect Request Routing:**  The incorrect path information could lead to the application not being able to correctly route the request.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted URL:** An attacker could construct a URL with path parameters, with the intention to cause the web server to pass incorrect information to the application, thus causing the application to malfunction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests with URLs containing path parameters to a vulnerable Tomcat server.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The issue resides in the `CoyoteAdapter`'s `postParseRequest()` method.
*   The method truncates the path at the first semicolon (`;`).
*   The class `org.apache.tomcat.util.http.mapper.Mapper` correctly handles path information but does not receive the full path from the `CoyoteAdapter`.
*   The `MessageBytes` class, which holds character and byte arrays, has inconsistent data because only the byte array was being modified when removing the session ID, leading to inconsistencies.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report highlights a conflict between how Tomcat handles path parameters and what the Servlet Specification implies, and the ambiguity of how path parameters should be handled.
*   The discussion within the bug report shows that while path parameters are technically allowed in the URL, there was a debate whether they should be included in the `getPathInfo()` return value or stripped out.
*   The Servlet Spec lead at the time recommended removing them, but it was not a fully resolved point in the spec at the time.
*   The bug report was closed as "RESOLVED WONTFIX", likely due to the decision to remove the path parameters rather than include them in pathInfo.
