{
  "CVE-2010-3689": {
    "description": "Dmitri Gribenko discovered that the soffice script does not treat an empty LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable like an unset one, may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `soffice` script in OpenOffice.org incorrectly handles an empty `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable. Instead of treating it as unset, the script interprets it as an empty string, leading to the current working directory being included in the library search path.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable",
        "Potential for arbitrary code execution via malicious shared libraries."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious shared library in a directory where a user runs the vulnerable `soffice` script.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Local exploitation by manipulating the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and placing a malicious shared library in the current working directory."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to write files in a directory where a user might execute the `soffice` script",
           "Ability to manipulate the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable."
      ]
    },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists because when LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to an empty value, the script uses this as an empty entry in a colon separated list, which causes ld.so(8) to treat the current working directory ('.') as a path to search for libraries"
