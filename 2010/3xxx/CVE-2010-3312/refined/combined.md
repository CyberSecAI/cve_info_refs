Subject: Re: CVE request: epiphany not checking ssl certs

If an application does not advertise a security feature, then in general
we will not give a CVE because of its absence of the feature (I don't want
to give out 50,000 CVEs for every protocol that does cleartext
transmission... or uses DES... etc.)  Similarly, we generally avoid
assigning CVEs to "defense in depth" fixes, although the line between
"vulnerability" and "defense in depth" can get fuzzy.

The <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=564690#5> title says
"Does not longer check certificates" which could be interpreted to mean
that it used to check certs, and now it doesn't.  If that's the case, then
it makes sense to assign a CVE.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml documents could crash applications linked
against libxml2 (CVE-2010-4008).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- tomboy
The tomboy startup scripts put empty elements in LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
causing tomboy to load shared libraries from the current directory
(CVE-2010-4005).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit
that to modify or forge messages
(CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020, CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- php5
Insufficient handling of certain character sequences in the
utf8\_decode() function could be leveraged to conduct
cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2010-3870).
php5 could also consume large amounts of memory and crash if a long
mail address was passed to filter\_var() with parmeter
FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL (CVE-2010-3710).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- cups
- CVE-2010-3702: Specially crafted PDF files could crash pdftops or
potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code.
- CVE-2010-2941: Specially crafted IPP requests could crash cupsd
- CVE-2010-0542: A NULL pointer dereference in the \_WriteProlog()
function of the texttops image filter.
- CVE-2010-1748: An attacker with access to the web-interface may be
able to read some bytes of uninitialized memory.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Untrusted applets could read values of restricted system properties
(CVE-2010-3860).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- epiphany
Epiphany does not support verification of ssl certificates. It
nevertheless displayed all https connections as secure
(CVE-2010-3312).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2
- encfs
- CVE-2010-3073: encfs only used 32bits for the IV
- CVE-2010-3074: encfs was prone to a watermarking attack
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

I'm not following this. What exactly is getting a CVE id here?

Looking at what we have on our Distros I found three different kinds
of behavior:
1) epiphany 1.8.5 with mozilla engine raises a popup window if the
   certificate cant't be verified. The status bar displays a broken
   lock icon if one chooses to continue anyways.
2) epiphany 2.28 changes address bar color, displays a lock icon and
   connects just fine even if it can't verify certificates. The code
   simply uses a strcmp for 'https' as trigger.
3) epiphany 2.30 shows the broken lock icon as described in the
   debian bug report

While the modest security indicators of 3) are probably not the most
smartest way to tell the user about a potential problem the real
danger is 2). That version of epiphany really is broken. If a
program doesn't implement the necessary checks it should at the very
least not display common https security indicators either.

Any specific reason to only give CVE to epiphany if you want to start
giving CVEs for this kind of flaw?  IIRC, not long ago, no
WebKitGtk-based browser I tried verified server SSL certificates and
all connected without any complaint or indication that SSL certificate
was not verified.  None seemed to offer any configuration option to
enable certificate checking.  I guess there may be / was some
limitations on WebKitGtk side that can explain this.

I noticed midori now uses different address bar background color, which
seem to be similar to the epiphany fix described in the Debian bug.

Oh, now I see you're probably asking for CVE for post-deb#564690
behavior, not pre-deb#564690, right?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=600663#c0)  Sam Morris    2009-11-04 11:07:52 UTC  ``` I just noticed that Epiphany did not throw up a certificate verification error when it should.  You can observe this at <<https://bugzilla.samba.org/>>. There is no warning or indication of any kind that the certificate presented by the web server has not been signed by an approved CA.  This is really serious. I'm rather annoyed that I've been using 2.28 for some time to connect to my bank, and I could have been MITMd at any point during that time. Not to mention all the other sites I use and now have to change passwords for! ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=600663#c1)  Kjo Hansi Glaz    2009-12-15 15:04:56 UTC  ``` I confirm this major security issue under epiphany-webkit 2.29.3-1 from Debian testing. Certificates are not validated at all, i.e. they are all trusted. As far as I understood this problem comes from :  - libsoup, which doesn't initialize its trusted CA list by default, and trust everybody rather than nobody ;  - libwebkit, which doesn't set the "ssl-ca-file" property when creating a SoupSession object. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=600663#c2)  Reinout van Schouwen    2009-12-18 21:15:32 UTC  ``` Confirmed; Dan is working on supporting this in libsoup. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=600663#c3)  Gustavo Noronha (kov)    2010-02-18 16:37:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 154151](attachment.cgi?id=154151 "Paliative solution while the GIO TLS port is in progress") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=154151&action=edit "Paliative solution while the GIO TLS port is in progress") [[review]](review?bug=600663&attachment=154151) Paliative solution while the GIO TLS port is in progress  Since our real solution is not going to be ready for 2.30, I am proposing a paliative solution that would at least allow Epiphany to report that a cert is not valid through its padlock icon.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

The feature was lost in the transition from gecko to webkit (or more
accurately libsoup for certificate support). I think it makes sense to
assign an id since it does involve the loss of an expected security
feature.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
Package: epiphany-browser
Version: 2.29.3-1
Severity: grave

Current epiphany does not verify the certificates for https-connections.
This makes it unsuitable for almost any secure operation without big fat
warnings.

Version: 2.29.91-1

commit 3e0f7dea754381c5ad11a06ccc62eb153382b498
Author: Gustavo Noronha Silva <gns@gnome.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 18 14:30:49 2010 -0200

    Report broken certs through the padlock icon

    This uses a new feature in libsoup that reports through a
    SoupMessageFlag whether the message is talking to a server that has a
    trusted server.

    Bug #600663

Note that there is no integrated certificate manager yet, but you can
have basic certificate management with ca-certificates.

Cheers,

I suppose this doesn't affect Stable, since the switch to webkit
was done post-Lenny?
