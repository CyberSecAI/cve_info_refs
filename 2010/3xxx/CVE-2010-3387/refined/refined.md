Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-3387:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `vdrleaktest` script in the `vdr-dbg` package, which incorrectly modifies the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. The script attempts to add `/usr/lib/debug` to the beginning of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` using the following code:
```bash
LANG=C LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/debug;$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```
The vulnerability arises from two issues related to this modification:

1.  **Incorrect Separator:** The use of a semicolon (`;`) instead of a colon (`:`) to separate paths in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is not how `ld.so` interprets the variable, so the intended path is not being set and will be ignored.
2.  **Empty Path Handling:** When a path within `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is empty, such as due to a pre-existing value that results in `"::"` or at the start/end of the string, `ld.so` treats this as the current working directory (`.`). This means a malicious user can place a specially crafted shared library in the current working directory which could be loaded instead of a legitimate library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Library Loading:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure modification of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, allowing an attacker to potentially inject and execute arbitrary code through a maliciously crafted shared library.
*   **Incorrect use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH:** The usage of a semicolon instead of colon to separate directories makes the intended directory ineffective.
*   **Empty Path Interpretation:** The interpretation of empty paths (`::`, `^:` or `:$`) as the current working directory allows for a local privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `vdrleaktest` by placing a malicious shared library in the current working directory.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If `vdrleaktest` is run by a privileged user, the attacker can potentially escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local and requires the attacker to have write access to the directory where `vdrleaktest` is executed.
*   **Trojan Horse Library:** The attacker needs to create a malicious shared library (Trojan horse) with the same name as a library that might be used by the vdr-dbg application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `vdr-dbg` is installed.
*   **Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to the directory where `vdrleaktest` is executed.
*   **Knowledge of Libraries:** The attacker needs to know what libraries will be used by the executed program to be able to create the malicious shared library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The initial report incorrectly stated that a semicolon was the cause, but it is the empty path in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH which causes the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability exists in a debugging utility (`vdrleaktest`), which was initially deemed to be of lower severity but it was still patched in the end.
*   Multiple patches were proposed and rejected due to errors before the final fix was implemented. The final fix was to use the following assignment for `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/debug${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
```
This correctly prepends `/usr/lib/debug` and also ensures that a double colon is not present in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.
