```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by the OpenType Font (OTF) driver not properly resetting a pointer when freeing memory, leading to a double-free condition.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Double-free vulnerability
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Attack vectors:
  - On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems: By hosting a specially crafted OpenType font on a network share, which when accessed by a user through Windows Explorer would trigger the vulnerability via the Details and Preview panes.
  - On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems: An attacker would first have to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - For remote exploitation on newer systems, the attacker needs to host a malicious font file on a network share and lure a user to access it via Windows Explorer.
  - For local exploitation on older systems, the attacker requires prior access to the system to execute a crafted application.
