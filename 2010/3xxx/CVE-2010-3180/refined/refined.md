{
  "CVE-2010-3180": {
    "Description": "It was possible to access the `locationbar` property of a `window` object after it had been closed. Since the closed `window`'s memory could have been subsequently reused by the system it was possible that an attempt to access the `locationbar` property could result in the execution of attacker-controlled memory.",
    "Root cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the nsBarProp function. Accessing the locationbar property of a closed window.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Execution of attacker-controlled memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": "By tricking a user to interact with a malicious webpage with javascript.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to trick the user into loading a malicious web page."
