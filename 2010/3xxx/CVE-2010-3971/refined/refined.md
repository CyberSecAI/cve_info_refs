Here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2010-3971:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free error in the `mshtml.dll` library when handling CSS stylesheets with recursive `@import` rules. Specifically, when processing a web page that references a CSS file with multiple `@import` rules pointing to itself, Internet Explorer improperly handles memory resulting in a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the CSS parser of Internet Explorer (versions 6, 7, and 8).
- Improper memory handling when processing recursive CSS `@import` rules.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution with the privileges of the user viewing the crafted content.
- If the user is an administrator, an attacker can take complete control of the affected system. This includes:
   - Installing programs
   - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
   - Creating new accounts with full user rights
- Denial of service (DoS) can also be achieved by triggering the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Specially crafted HTML documents (web pages, HTML emails, HTML attachments).
- Specifically, a web page referencing a CSS file with multiple, recursive `@import` rules.
- An attacker would need to convince a user to view the malicious HTML content. This could be achieved through:
    - Phishing emails with links
    - Compromised websites hosting the malicious code
    - Malicious advertisements

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to host or deliver the malicious HTML content.
- No specific user privileges are required for exploitation.
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.

**Additional details:**
- Public exploit code is available.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8.
- Microsoft released security bulletin MS11-003 to address this issue.
- Workarounds include enabling DEP, setting the Internet zone security level to High, disabling Active Scripting, and modifying the Internet Explorer CSS style sheet.
- Microsoft also provides a "Microsoft Fix it" solution to prevent recursive loading of CSS style sheets.
