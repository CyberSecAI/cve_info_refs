How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: fuse-utils
Version: 2.7.4-1.1+lenny1
Severity: grave
File: /usr/bin/fusermount
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

As reported on a public mailing list, fusermount in Ubuntu allows
unprivileged users to unmount anything. I wonder if Debian is affected.

It would be more helpful if you checked, before filing grave bugs on
packages.

This sounds very much like [CVE-2009-3297](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3297), which has been fixed in
unstable, testing and stable since February (see DSA-1989-1).

Dear Adam,

> packages.

I apologize for my laziness. I do not normally use fuse. Maybe I could
set up a test machine, but (unless succeeded in the exploit) would not
properly know whether Debian was safe. I thought it was better to warn
now, than leave blissfully vulnerable.

> This sounds very much like [CVE-2009-3297](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3297), which has been fixed in

The page  <http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-1989>  refers to
<http://bugs.debian.org/567633>  which says:
  a race condition if two fusermount -u instances are run in paralell
so that does not seem to be the same issue.

The page  <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-1989-1>  points
to  <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0789>  which
mentions "a symlink attack", which may be closer to this issue.

I would expect DSA-1989 to have been adopted and fixed by Ubuntu,
where the original poster says he found the issue.

Looks like there's still no fix available?  Tagging as can-defer for
squeeze, this can be handled through security.d.o or a point release.

I've been trying to get to the bottom of this bug over the past day, not
helped by libfuse redirecting fusermount's stderr to /dev/null.

There are actually two bugs here with roughly the same effect.

When mounting, fusermount must:
1. Make the mount() system call;
2. Run the mount command to record the mountpoint in /etc/mtab;
3. If (2) fails then unmount using the umount2() system call.

We must prevent the mount command from canonicalising symlinks when
adding to /etc/mtab.  This is supposed to be done already, but there is
an automatic fallback for compatibility with old versions of the mount
command which can be exploited by forcing the first invocation to fail.

Currently (3) uses the absolute path, which may have been redirected
since (1).

I'll apply the attached patch for squeeze.  Unfortunately we cannot fix
the first bug on lenny as its version of mount does not support
--no-canonicalize.  There is no point in fixing only one of the bugs.

Ben.

Actually, this doesn't quite work: the call to umount2() will refer to
the mountpoint directory (now hidden) whereas we need to refer to the
mounted directory.  Maybe this call should be removed completely, as I
don't think it can be made reliable.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=651183#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-08 22:35:33 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that the fusermount tool was vulnerable to a race condition between mounting a user filesystem and updating mtab using the standard mount command.  If a user were able to win the race, the real mount entry and the mtab entry would differ, making the fuse-mounted filesystem not unmountable by an unprivileged user.  Crafted mtab entries can then be used to trick fusermount into believing that a certain part of the filesystem is a user-space filesystem, and will unmount what should be a privileged filesystem (as demonstrated by unmounting /proc).  According to the SUSE bug report [3], this would affect fuse versions before 2.8.2 or util-linux before 2.17, and notes the following commits that correct the problem:  Relevant fuse commits:    4c3d9b1957 "Use '--no-canonicalize' option of mount(8)..."   0197ce4041 "Using --no-canonicalize with umount(8) conflicts with..."  and util-linux commits:    45fc569a75 "mount: add --no-canonicalize option"    be9adec40f "mount: disable --no-canonicalize for non-root users"  [1] <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/FuseTimerace/> [2] <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Nov/15> [3] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=651598>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=651183#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-23 21:25:36 UTC  ``` In addition to the --no-canonicalize option, the --fake option is also required in umount, which is present in 2.18:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=commitdiff;h=97a3cef4f1>  Another relevant util-linux-ng commit is:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=commitdiff;h=1cf4c20b19> ("spec" still canonicalized)  The above two would be required for util-linux-ng in RHEL6.  All of the commits would be required for util-linux in RHEL5.  Fedora 14 has the required util-linux-ng version, but needs the fuse fixes backported.  SUSE has a patch to fuse to make it use --no-canonicalize and --fake which should fix the issue:  <https://bugzilla.novell.com/attachment.cgi?id=399921>  Unfortunately, I've been using RHEL6 to test and with the above patches (to fuse and util-linux-ng) and the proof of concept still works.  So I don't think these patches are sufficient to correct the problem, although I'm not sure what is missing.  Tom, would have a chance to look at this and see if perhaps something is missing?  FWIW, I cannot reproduce this on F14.  Despite there being no group-restrictions on fuse (not sure why that's the case), I get the following error:  sh Test.sh Using target call count 8 Move triggered at count 8 fusermount: user has no write access to mountpoint /proc fusermount: could not determine username  (although sometimes that first fusermount error shows:  fusermount: user has no write access to mountpoint /home/vdanen/tmp/CVE-2010-3879/tmp/proc  which is the user-mounted directory).  By contrast, fuse-2.8.5-2.fc13 and util-linux-ng-2.17.2-8.fc13 allow me to reproduce this on F13.  The same fuse version is on both, but F14 has (a newer) util-linux-ng-2.18-4.5.fc14.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=651183#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-23 22:06:49 UTC  ``` After rebuilding util-linux-ng-2.18-4.5 on Fedora 13, I am still able to reproduce the problem.  Then I realized there was an issue with my F14 testing vm, so after rebooting it, I can indeed reproduce this on F14 (seems something was mucked with sssd which is why I was seeing those permissions errors).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=651183#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-23 22:38:27 UTC  ``` Patched fuse on F14 and still reproduces (using the SUSE patch).  So it's either not sufficient or something is still missing from util-linux-ng (on F14, the 1cf4c20b19 patch is missing; rebuilt with just that patch (on 2.18-4.5) and can still reproduce).

It still takes a bit of persistance, but it works.  No one else has released updates for this.  At this point I think we're going to defer it because we don't have a working fix (I'm not even sure if upstream does either at this point) and, for RHEL at least, you need to be in the fuse group to do anything with this.

Since we would need to fix them all to get a comprehensive fix, I'm noting them all here as opposed to filing new bugs.  Marc Deslauriers summarized the following on oss-security (<http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q1/173>):  CVE-2011-0541:  <http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=bf5ffb5fd8558bd799791834def431c0cee5a11f>  Fuse tries to mount a directory without resolving symlinks, and then tries to update mtab. If it couldn't update mtab, it would unmount the directory while resolving symlinks this time, resulting in a different directory being unmounted.   CVE-2011-0542:  <http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=1e7607ff89c65b005f69e27aeb1649d624099873>  This prevents local users from changing the location of the current directory from under fuse using a timing attack.   CVE-2011-0543:  <http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=cbd3a2a84068aae6e3fe32939d88470d712dbf47>  Fuse uses the --no-canonicalize mount option to prevent a symlink attack on the mount point written to mtab. For backwards compatibility reasons, it would fallback to using mount in an insecure way. This fallback could get triggered by a user when an entry already existed in mtab.   All three of these issues allowed local users to trick fuse into unmounting arbitrary directories.   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=651183#c37)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-23 17:59:55 UTC  ``` We should now have enough information to get this fully corrected in Fedora.   ```  [Comment 40](show_bug.cgi?id=651183#c40)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-21 19:07:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 486670](attachment.cgi?id=486670&action=diff "patch to correct the flaw in fuse on Fedora 14 (v2.8.5)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=486670&action=edit "patch to correct the flaw in fuse on Fedora 14 (v2.8.5)") patch to correct the flaw in fuse on Fedora 14 (v2.8.5)  Current fuse 2.8.5-5.fc14 still fails.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: fuse-utils

As reported on a public mailing list, fusermount in Ubuntu allows

unprivileged users to unmount anything. For details, please see:

<http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-November/077247.html>

Subject: [oss-security] CVE request: fuse

Hello,

There is an issue with FUSE that lets unprivileged users unmount

arbitrary locations via a symlink attack. This is a different issue than

CVE-2009-3297 and CVE-2010-0789.

Ref.:

<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Nov/15>

<http://www.halfdog.net/Security/FuseTimerace/>

Thanks,

Marc.

Subject: [oss-security] CVE request: fuse
Hello,
There is an issue with FUSE that lets unprivileged users unmount
arbitrary locations via a symlink attack. This is a different issue than
CVE-2009-3297 and CVE-2010-0789.
Ref.:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Nov/15

It was reported [1],[2] that the fusermount tool was vulnerable to a race condition between mounting a user filesystem and updating mtab using the standard mount command. If a user were able to win the race, the real mount entry and the mtab entry would differ, making the fuse-mounted filesystem not unmountable by an unprivileged user. Crafted mtab entries can then be used to trick fusermount into believing that a certain part of the filesystem is a user-space filesystem, and will unmount what should be a privileged filesystem (as demonstrated by unmounting /proc).

According to the SUSE bug report [3], this would affect fuse versions before 2.8.2 or util-linux before 2.17, and notes the following commits that correct the problem:

fuse fix

Looking deeper, the above is not entirely correct. Fuse versions 2.7.\* and 2.8.\* are all affected. The fix needs "--no-canonicalize" and "--fake" options in umount(8), which is present in util-linux-ng >= 2.18.

The following commits need backporting to earlier versions of util-linux-ng:

45fc569a75 mount: add --no-canonicalize option

  be9adec40f mount: disable --no-canonicalize for non-root users

  387ade2a24 umount: add --no-canonicalize

  97a3cef4f1 umount: add --fake option to umount(8)

And a similar race exists during mount, so --no-canonicalize is needed in mount(8) too (covered by the commits listed above).

Fuse versions <2.8.2 need to have these commits backported:

In addition to the --no-canonicalize option, the --fake option is also required in umount, which is present in 2.18:

<http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=commitdiff;h=97a3cef4f1>

Another relevant util-linux-ng commit is:

<http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=commitdiff;h=1cf4c20b19> ("spec" still canonicalized)

The above two would be required for util-linux-ng in RHEL6. All of the commits would be required for util-linux in RHEL5.

Fedora 14 has the required util-linux-ng version, but needs the fuse fixes backported. SUSE has a patch to fuse to make it use --no-canonicalize and --fake which should fix the issue:

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/attachment.cgi?id=399921>

Unfortunately, I've been using RHEL6 to test and with the above patches (to fuse and util-linux-ng) and the proof of concept still works. So I don't think these patches are sufficient to correct the problem, although I'm not sure what is missing.

Tom, would have a chance to look at this and see if perhaps something is missing? FWIW, I cannot reproduce this on F14. Despite there being no group-restrictions on fuse (not sure why that's the case), I get the following error:

sh Test.sh

Using target call count 8

Move triggered at count 8

fusermount: user has no write access to mountpoint /proc

fusermount: could not determine username

(although sometimes that first fusermount error shows:

fusermount: user has no write access to mountpoint /home/vdanen/tmp/CVE-2010-3879/tmp/proc

which is the user-mounted directory).

By contrast, fuse-2.8.5-2.fc13 and util-linux-ng-2.17.2-8.fc13 allow me to reproduce this on F13. The same fuse version is on both, but F14 has (a newer) util-linux-ng-2.18-4.5.fc14.

In addition to the --no-canonicalize option, the --fake option is also required in umount, which is present in 2.18:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=commitdiff;h=97a3cef4f1

After rebuilding util-linux-ng-2.18-4.5 on Fedora 13, I am still able to reproduce the problem.

Then I realized there was an issue with my F14 testing vm, so after rebooting it, I can indeed reproduce this on F14 (seems something was mucked with sssd which is why I was seeing those permissions errors).

Patched fuse on F14 and still reproduces (using the SUSE patch). So it's either not sufficient or something is still missing from util-linux-ng (on F14, the 1cf4c20b19 patch is missing; rebuilt with just that patch (on 2.18-4.5) and can still reproduce).

So it looks like there is more required than any of these patches to resolve this.

I noticed they had released updates to fix it and figured I'd make sure before going through the work of extracting their patches (which they backported from upstream by the looks of things). It still takes a bit of persistance, but it works.

No one else has released updates for this. At this point I think we're going to defer it because we don't have a working fix (I'm not even sure if upstream does either at this point) and, for RHEL at least, you need to be in the fuse group to do anything with this.

Does anyone know why Fedora does not have the same policy (of the user having to be in the fuse group in order to use the tools)?

I'm not sure fuse is on the approved component list for 6.1, so this will still have to wait until 6.2. Also this probably needs to depend on the kernel component as well (which is bz673177).

I've just installed util-linux-ng-2.18-4.8.fc14 from koji in my F14/x86\_64 VM and did a git clone of the fuse git repository and built an rpm from it to install in the VM.

So with the util-linux-ng that gives us the options we need, and upstream's latest code for fuse, I can still reproduce this, so it is not fixed upstream.

I found in the fuse upstream commit eba226948b44d5a303a10908d440e808eaf0bae6 that the code checks for "util-linux-ng 2.18" in the "mount --version" output (yeah, there is hardcoded package name and version).

It means that this code will be useless on systems where we backport patches (RHEL6 with util-linux 2.17) or in distributions where is already the latest upstream without the "-ng" suffix (Fedora >= 15).

I'll send an e-mail to Miklos.

More CVE names have been assigned to this issue. Since we would need to fix them all to get a comprehensive fix, I'm noting them all here as opposed to filing new bugs.

Marc Deslauriers summarized the following on oss-security (<http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q1/173>):

CVE-2011-0541:

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=bf5ffb5fd8558bd799791834def431c0cee5a11f>

Fuse tries to mount a directory without resolving symlinks, and then tries to update mtab. If it couldn't update mtab, it would unmount the directory while resolving symlinks this time, resulting in a different directory being unmounted.

CVE-2011-0542:

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=1e7607ff89c65b005f69e27aeb1649d624099873>

This prevents local users from changing the location of the current directory from under fuse using a timing attack.

CVE-2011-0543:

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=cbd3a2a84068aae6e3fe32939d88470d712dbf47>

Fuse uses the --no-canonicalize mount option to prevent a symlink attack on the mount point written to mtab. For backwards compatibility reasons, it would fallback to using mount in an insecure way. This fallback could get triggered by a user when an entry already existed in mtab.

All three of these issues allowed local users to trick fuse into unmounting arbitrary directories.

patch to correct the flaw in fuse on Fedora 14 (v2.8.5)

Current fuse 2.8.5-5.fc14 still fails. I've taken the three upstream commits, merged them, and added the missing bits to make them complete and I've tested it with the original exploit and the new test that showed the failures on Ubuntu, running them 20 times in a row, without being able to umount /proc. I believe that this patch will solve the problem, or at least get us closer (it does work for me, but I've not tested it any way other than using these tests to make sure it was no longer possible to unmount /proc).

patch to correct the flaw in fuse on Fedora 14 (v2.8.5)
Current fuse 2.8.5-5.fc14 still fails. I've taken the three upstream commits, merged them, and added the missing bits to make them complete and I've tested it with the original exploit and the new test that showed the failures on Ubuntu, running them 20 times in a row, without being able to umount /proc. I believe that this patch will solve the problem, or at least get us closer (it does work for me, but I've not tested it any way other than using these tests to make sure it was no longer possible to unmount /proc).

Thanks, Peter. That would be great. My back-porting skills are ok, but I'd like to make sure that nothing got broken in the process. It does solve the problem itself, I'm just hoping there are no other regressions. A review would be very much appreciated.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux this is a low impact issue due to the fuse group requirement. The appropriate CVSSv2 score for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is 2.6/AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P (AC:H due to an administrator needing to add someone to the fuse group).

On Fedora it is different, because there are no group restrictions in place. On Fedora, this is a moderate impact issue (3.6/AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P).

Statement:

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, a user must be a member of the 'fuse' group in order to use FUSE. Due to the risks associated with fixing this bug on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and because of the group restrictions in place, we currently have no plans to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Package: fuse-utils
Version: 2.7.4-1.1+lenny1
Severity: grave
File: /usr/bin/fusermount
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

As reported on a public mailing list, fusermount in Ubuntu allows
unprivileged users to unmount anything. I wonder if Debian is affected.

It would be more helpful if you checked, before filing grave bugs on
packages.

This sounds very much like [CVE-2009-3297](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3297), which has been fixed in
unstable, testing and stable since February (see DSA-1989-1).

Dear Adam,

> packages.

I apologize for my laziness. I do not normally use fuse. Maybe I could
set up a test machine, but (unless succeeded in the exploit) would not
properly know whether Debian was safe. I thought it was better to warn
now, than leave blissfully vulnerable.

> This sounds very much like [CVE-2009-3297](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3297), which has been fixed in

The page  <http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-1989>  refers to
<http://bugs.debian.org/567633>  which says:
  a race condition if two fusermount -u instances are run in paralell
so that does not seem to be the same issue.

The page  <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-1989-1>  points
to  <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0789>  which
mentions "a symlink attack", which may be closer to this issue.

I would expect DSA-1989 to have been adopted and fixed by Ubuntu,
where the original poster says he found the issue.

Looks like there's still no fix available?  Tagging as can-defer for
squeeze, this can be handled through security.d.o or a point release.

I've been trying to get to the bottom of this bug over the past day, not
helped by libfuse redirecting fusermount's stderr to /dev/null.

There are actually two bugs here with roughly the same effect.

When mounting, fusermount must:
1. Make the mount() system call;
2. Run the mount command to record the mountpoint in /etc/mtab;
3. If (2) fails then unmount using the umount2() system call.

We must prevent the mount command from canonicalising symlinks when
adding to /etc/mtab.  This is supposed to be done already, but there is
an automatic fallback for compatibility with old versions of the mount
command which can be exploited by forcing the first invocation to fail.

Currently (3) uses the absolute path, which may have been redirected
since (1).

I'll apply the attached patch for squeeze.  Unfortunately we cannot fix
the first bug on lenny as its version of mount does not support
--no-canonicalize.  There is no point in fixing only one of the bugs.

Ben.

Actually, this doesn't quite work: the call to umount2() will refer to
the mountpoint directory (now hidden) whereas we need to refer to the
mounted directory.  Maybe this call should be removed completely, as I
don't think it can be made reliable.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

## Details

USN-1045-1 fixed vulnerabilities in FUSE. This update to util-linux adds

support for new options required by the FUSE update.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that FUSE could be tricked into incorrectly updating the

mtab file when mounting filesystems. A local attacker, with access to use

FUSE, could unmount arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# util-linux 2.17.2-0ubuntu1.10.04.1 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
util-linux (2.17.2-0ubuntu1.10.04.1) lucid-security; urgency=low

  * SECURITY UPDATE: arbitrary unmount with fuse (LP: [#670622](/bugs/670622))
    - This update adds support for new options required by the fuse
      security update.
    - mount/umount.{c,8}: Add --fake option to umount(8), which omits
      calling the actual umount syscall (and the loop device deletion) but
      modifies /etc/mtab.
      - http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=commit;h=97a3cef4f1
    - mount/devname.c: "Spec" was still canonicalized despite
      --no-canonicalize.  This resulted in a hang during login with
      pam_encfs. (Debian Bug #593336)
    - http://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux-ng/util-linux-ng.git;a=commit;h=1cf4c20b19
    - CVE-2010-3879

# Unmount Any Filesystem Using fusermount

## Bug description:

At least on Ubuntu Lucid the fusermount
tool contains a timerace
mounting a user filesystem and updating mtab using the standard
*mount* command. Since the mount command is called using
*exec*, the window of opportunity is rather large. The
mount command will also normalize the target path so that moving
the real fuse mountpoint and replacing it with a symlink will
make mount update mtab using the path where the symlink points
to, e.g. */proc*. The result is, that the real mount entry
and mtab entry differ, which makes the fuse-mounted filesystem
non-unmountable by an unprivileged user. Crafted mtab entries
can then be used to trick *fusermount* to believe that
some part of the filesystem is a user space filesystem and
the program will unmount them normally.

# Methods

## POC:

* <FuseMinimal.c>: Minimal fuse
  implementation, just needed to make mount work.
* <DirModifyInotify.c>: Simple
  inotify listener to move directory and add symlink instead
* <Test.sh>: Example script, how to put
  things together

Hello,

There is an issue with FUSE that lets unprivileged users unmount
arbitrary locations via a symlink attack. This is a different issue than
CVE-2009-3297 and CVE-2010-0789.

Thanks,
