## Summary of CVE-2010-3879

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A race condition exists in the `fusermount` tool when mounting a FUSE filesystem and updating `/etc/mtab`.
*   The `mount` command used by `fusermount` to record the mount point in `/etc/mtab` can be tricked into normalizing symlinks. This means a crafted symlink can cause the mount command to write the wrong mountpoint into `/etc/mtab`.
*   When unmounting, `fusermount` uses the information in `/etc/mtab`. If this entry has been modified to point to a different location than the actual mountpoint, a local attacker can unmount an arbitrary filesystem.
*   Additionally, a fallback mechanism in `fusermount` (for compatibility with older versions of the mount command) can be exploited to trigger the issue, if `/etc/mtab` already contains an entry for the target.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Race condition:** A race condition between the initial mount and the update of `/etc/mtab`.
*   **Symlink vulnerability:** Incorrect handling of symlinks during mtab updates allows an attacker to manipulate the recorded mount point.
*   **Insecure fallback:** An insecure fallback behavior in `fusermount` that attempts to write to `/etc/mtab` even when  `--no-canonicalize` fails.
*   **Inconsistent path usage:** `fusermount` does not consistently use the correct absolute path for unmounting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Unmount:** A local attacker can unmount arbitrary file systems, including critical ones like `/proc`.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By unmounting critical file systems, attackers can cause system instability or DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **FUSE Usage:** The attacker needs the ability to use FUSE to create their own filesystems.
*   **Symlink Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates symlinks related to the mountpoint to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** Any local user (or attacker with local access) can exploit this.
*   **FUSE access:** The user must be authorized to use FUSE (on some systems, this requires being a member of the "fuse" group). On some systems (e.g. Fedora) all users are able to use FUSE.
*   **Timing Control:** Ability to influence the race condition, which is generally achievable on a local system.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability affects FUSE versions before 2.8.2 or util-linux before 2.17.
*   Several CVEs have been assigned to this issue, indicating the different aspects and vectors of the vulnerability: CVE-2010-3879, CVE-2011-0541, CVE-2011-0542 and CVE-2011-0543.
*   Patches involve backporting commits that add the "--no-canonicalize" and "--fake" options to mount and umount, and fixing the race conditions.
*   The issue was initially discovered and reported on public mailing lists, affecting multiple Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat, SUSE).
*   Fixes require both FUSE and util-linux updates.

**In Summary:**

This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability related to `fusermount` and FUSE that can be triggered by a malicious local user using a symlink attack against the filesystem mounting system. It allows the attacker to unmount arbitrary filesystems causing a DoS. Fixes require patching both `fuse-utils` and `util-linux` to properly handle symlinks during mounting and unmounting operations.
