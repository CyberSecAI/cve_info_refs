    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_cde394d6_20250124_122320.html",
      "root_cause": "Stack buffer overflow",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (crashes the application)",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted ZIP file."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious ZIP file and convince the victim to open it with the vulnerable software.",
     "additional_info": "The provided code demonstrates a proof-of-concept exploit for PowerZip 7.21, where a specially crafted ZIP file triggers a stack buffer overflow. The exploit is not fully functional because it causes an exit call, but it demonstrates the vulnerability. The vulnerable software is stated to be affected on various Windows versions including Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, Me, 98 and NT 4.0. The exploit code provides a method to generate this malicious file, but the exploit itself is local."

      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_2695351e_20250124_122321.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way that MFC handles application requests to rename window titles.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote Code Execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker must be able to influence the window title of any window in an MFC application."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker must influence the window title of an MFC application. This can be through malicious files opened in the application or via network communication with the application (chat, web browser). A user must also log on with administrative user rights for the attacker to gain complete control of the system. Users with fewer rights would be less impacted.",
        "additional_info": "This vulnerability is present in the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library, affecting applications built with this library. The security update mitigates the vulnerability by adding additional checks to requests for window title changes. Microsoft notes that while there is a vulnerability in MFC, not all MFC applications are vulnerable and exploitation would require user interaction depending on the attack vector. They also acknowledge a third-party application can be used as an attack vector, successful exploitation requires a user to open a malicious file and then interact with it further. Microsoft recommends MFC applications should dynamically link to versions of MFC shipped with Windows rather than statically including a vulnerable version. Also noted, Server Core installations are not affected."
