{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `include_path` parameter in multiple PHP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `include_path` parameter in the URL of several PHP files such as `checkout2-CYM.php`, `checkout2-EN.php`, etc., an attacker can inject a URL to a malicious PHP file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a web server hosting the malicious PHP file."
