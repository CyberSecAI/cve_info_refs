Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Mount service (FastBackMount.exe) of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack. This service listens on UDP port 30005. The vulnerability lies in how the service processes incoming UDP packets. Specifically, it takes the second DWORD (double word, 4 bytes) from the received packet and uses it as a memory address to write the value 0x01.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Memory Overwrite:** The core weakness is that the service allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary memory address through the second DWORD of a received UDP packet, to which the service then writes the fixed value 0x01.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The service does not validate the memory address provided in the packet, enabling the arbitrary write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By strategically crafting UDP packets, an attacker can overwrite critical memory locations, which allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The CVSS score of 10.0 indicates the potential for a complete system compromise, including full control over confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **UDP Protocol:** Exploitation occurs through specially crafted UDP packets sent to port 30005.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the target system's UDP port 30005.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not needed to exploit this vulnerability. The service is vulnerable to anyone who can send it UDP packets.
*   **Packet Crafting:**  The attacker needs the ability to craft a UDP packet that contains the target memory address in the second DWORD.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on September 29, 2010, although it was reported to the vendor on January 6, 2010.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS users are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine filter ID 9966.
*   The IBM support document mentioned (swg21443820) may contain additional details.
