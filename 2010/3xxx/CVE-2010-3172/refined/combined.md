Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# 3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, and 3.7.3 Security Advisory

Tuesday, Nov 2nd, 2010
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* There is a way to inject both headers and content to users, causing
  a serious Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

* It was possible to see graphs from Old Charts even if you did not
  have access to a particular product, and you could browse a
  particular URL to see all product names.

* YUI 2.8.1, which shipped with Bugzilla starting with 3.7.x,
  contained a security vulnerability. The version of YUI shipped
  with Bugzilla 4.0rc1 and above has been updated to 2.8.2.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       HTTP Response Splitting
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Description: By inserting a certain string into a URL, it was possible
             to inject both headers and content to any browser that
             supported "Server Push" (mostly only Gecko-based browsers
             like Firefox). This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting
             vulnerabilities, and possibly other more dangerous
             security issues as well.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=600464#c0)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

Search result of b.m.o. does not escape "--------- =\_aaaaaaaaaa0": it is used as boudary of multipart/x-mixed-replace.
Attackers can inject boundary of multipart/x-mixed-replace.
It may be able to be used for HTTP Header injection.
Example:
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc=---------%20%3D_aaaaaaaaaa0&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&resolution=---&resolution=DUPLICATE>

I think, there are two solutions.
1. Change boudary text to be random.
2. If search result contains boundary text, replace it to HTML character reference.

This is really a bug with upstream CGI module... The default boundary is hardcoded when it should be randomized.
sub multipart\_init {
my($self,@p) = self\_or\_default(@\_);
my($boundary,@other) = rearrange\_header([BOUNDARY],@p);
$boundary = $boundary || '------- =\_aaaaaaaaaa0';
$self->{'separator'} = "$CRLF--$boundary$CRLF";
$self->{'final\_separator'} = "$CRLF--$boundary--$CRLF";
$type = SERVER\_PUSH($boundary);
return $self->header(
-nph => 0,
-type => $type,
(map { split "=", $\_, 2 } @other),
) . "WARNING: YOUR BROWSER DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS SERVER-PUSH TECHNOLOGY." . $self->multipart\_end;

Well played, sir! Excellent bug-finding skills.
The fix looks fine to me, although someone might claim there is a slightly more performant way to do it. But this code only runs once per request, so clarity probably wins. You might want to add a comment about why you are doing it.

Did you let them know we already have a CVE number assigned for it? I assume the number can be given to them at this point since it's actually they're bug and we're working around it. Or does the fact that we were already overriding that subroutine make ours a separate issue?

Using our generate\_random\_password() routine is not upward-portable back to the upstream CGI module, however, since they don't have that routine.

The CVE for this bug is solely for the Bugzilla-specific fix, as it's not actually patching the bug within CGI.pm but in our override function. However, if the CGI.pm maintainers need a CVE to be assigned for them, that can be easily arranged.

FYI:
It might be better to write documentation that describes why randomization is needed.
I cannot find any documentation that describes "why boundary is needed to randomized on dynamic contents that uses multipart/x-mixed-replace".
Almost of documentations and example uses non-random boundary.
for example: <http://perldoc.perl.org/CGI.html#Server-Push>
I can find only two documents that suggests randomization of boundary in example. But both of them does not describe why randomize is needed.
(1)Original Documentation of Netscape uses "--ThisRandomText".
<http://web.archive.org/web/20060424004246/wp.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/pushpull.html>
(2)O'Reilly Koala book (HTML: The Definitive Guide) uses "--SomeRandomText".

This page explains how x-mixed-replace is designed to be used. It's also makes it clear how a known boundary could
<http://www.abiglime.com/webmaster/articles/cgi/032498.htm>
It's not clear to me what an attacker would gain by using the known boundary. They already have the ability to send content. x-mixed-replace with a known boundary allows them to send two copies of the content and have the second replace the first.
Perhaps the issue is a case in which the first copy of the content is "good" content from a victim, but an attacker manages to craft a URL so that the good content is replaced with second piece of content which is malicious?
Having a clearer picture of how an exploit might would be helpful.

it's a variation on 'http response splitting', which can be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks, cross-user defacement, web cache poisoning, and similar exploits.

I think there are two patterns of attack for this bug.
1. set "--------- =\_aaaaaaaaaa0" to query parameter. (for example, [comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=600464#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - [SECURITY] Content/Header injection due to non-random multipart/x-mixed-replace boundary"))
2. set "--------- =\_aaaaaaaaaa0" to description of bug.
I did not test, because it is too dangerous to test at here. It may fail.

At bugzilla, CRLF in Summary of bug is not allowed, and CRLF will be converted to SPACE.
As a result of this convert, What attackers can do with bug description (Summary) seems to be only "breaking response".

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
