{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ax25_getname() function in the Linux kernel's AX.25 protocol implementation does not initialize all members of the fsa_digipeater field of the fsa struct. This uninitialized structure is then copied to user space.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Leak",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Leakage of kernel stack memory to user space.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access through the AX.25 network protocol.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access with the ability to interact with the AX.25 protocol."
