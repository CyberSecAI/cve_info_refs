{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `update_bad` and `update_phishing_sites` scripts in MailScanner download files over insecure HTTP connections without verifying their digital signatures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure download of configuration files",
      "Lack of digital signature verification",
      "Trusting files from unauthenticated sources"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform DNS or packet spoofing to inject malicious configuration files. Specifically, replacing the phishing whitelist could cause legitimate emails to be incorrectly flagged or malicious emails to be allowed through. Other attacks, potentially leading to DoS, are also possible depending on the parsing routines for the downloaded files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "DNS spoofing",
       "Packet spoofing",
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the mail server and the server hosting the configuration files, such as through DNS or packet spoofing. This typically requires a position on the local network or control over internet routing.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability allows replacing files, such as the phishing whitelist, and may lead to other attacks depending on the file parsing routines."
