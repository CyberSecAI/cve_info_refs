- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `artid` parameter of the `mod.php` script, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, modify data, or potentially gain control of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious SQL query within the `artid` parameter of the `mod.php` script, the attacker can manipulate the database query. Specifically, the vulnerable file is:  `http://localhost/[eNdonesia 8.4]/mod.php?mod=publisher&op=printarticle&artid=[valid id][sql-i]`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
