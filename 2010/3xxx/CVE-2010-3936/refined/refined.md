Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability CVE-2010-3936:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation within the `Signurl.asp` component of Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG). Specifically, the UAG web interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a non-persistent XSS issue. This means that malicious scripts can be injected into the web page, but the scripts are not stored on the server and will only be executed when the crafted URL is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the targeted user.
*   **Spoofing:**  The injected script can be used to spoof content displayed to the user, potentially tricking them into divulging sensitive information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The malicious script could be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information belonging to the user.
*   **Action Execution:** The attacker can perform actions on the UAG server on behalf of the targeted user, as permitted by the user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted URL:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious script code.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can use email, instant messages, or other means to trick users into clicking the crafted link.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject the malicious URL into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL that injects the XSS payload into the `Signurl.asp` page.
*   **Ability to trick a user:** The attacker must persuade a user to click the malicious URL. This could be through social engineering, phishing, or compromising a website that the target user visits.
*   **No direct access to the UAG server required:**  The attack is client-side; the user's browser executes the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is non-persistent, meaning the malicious script is not permanently stored on the server, which makes it harder to detect but still dangerous if exploited effectively.
*   The provided fix involves modifying how UAG handles input to the `Signurl.asp` page to prevent malicious scripts from being injected.
*   This vulnerability is one of four addressed in the same security bulletin for Forefront UAG.
