Debian Bug(s)  :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leak.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-2963

    Kees Cook discovered an issue in the v4l 32-bit compatibility layer for
    64-bit systems that allows local users with /dev/video write permission to
    overwrite arbitrary kernel memory, potentially leading to a privilege
    escalation. On Debian systems, access to /dev/video devices is restricted to
    members of the 'video' group by default.

CVE-2010-3067

    Tavis Ormandy discovered an issue in the io_submit system call. Local users
    can cause an integer overflow resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-3296

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the cxgb network driver that allows
    unprivileged users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3297

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the eql network driver that allows
    local users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3310

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the ROSE socket implementation. On
    systems with a rose device, local users can cause a denial of service
    (kernel memory corruption).

CVE-2010-3432

    Thomas Dreibholz discovered an issue in the SCTP protocol that permits a
    remote user to cause a denial of service (kernel panic).

CVE-2010-3437

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the pktcdvd driver. Local users with
    permission to open /dev/pktcdvd/control can obtain the contents of sensitive
    kernel memory or cause a denial of service. By default on Debian systems,
    this access is restricted to members of the group 'cdrom'.

CVE-2010-3442

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the ALSA sound system. Local users with
    permission to open /dev/snd/controlC0 can create an integer overflow
    condition that causes a denial of service. By default on Debian systems,
    this access is restricted to members of the group 'audio'.

CVE-2010-3448

    Dan Jacobson reported an issue in the thinkpad-acpi driver. On certain
    Thinkpad systems, local users can cause a denial of service (X.org crash) by
    reading /proc/acpi/ibm/video.

CVE-2010-3477

    Jeff Mahoney discovered an issue in the Traffic Policing (act_police) module
    that allows local users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-3705

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the HMAC processing code in the SCTP
    protocol that allows remote users to create a denial of service (memory
    corruption).

CVE-2010-3848

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    cause a stack overflow condition with large msg->msgiovlen values that can
    result in a denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2010-3849

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    cause a denial of service (oops) if a NULL remote addr value is passed as a
    parameter to sendmsg().

CVE-2010-3850

    Nelson Elhage discovered an issue in the Econet protocol. Local users can
    assign econet addresses to arbitrary interfaces due to a missing
    capabilities check.

CVE-2010-3858

    Brad Spengler reported an issue in the setup_arg_pages() function. Due to a
    bounds-checking failure, local users can create a denial of service (kernel
    oops).

CVE-2010-3859

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the TIPC protocol. When the tipc module
    is loaded, local users can gain elevated privileges via the sendmsg() system
    call.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Louis Rilling and Matthieu Fertré reported a use after free error in the

Linux kernel's futex\_wait function. A local user could exploit this flaw to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a

specially crafted application. ([CVE-2014-0205](/security/CVE-2014-0205))

Ben Hawkes discovered that the Linux kernel did not correctly filter

registers on 64bit kernels when performing 32bit system calls. On a 64bit

system, a local attacker could manipulate 32bit system calls to gain root

privileges. ([CVE-2010-3301](/security/CVE-2010-3301))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the btrfs filesystem did not correctly

validate permissions when using the clone function. A local attacker could

overwrite the contents of file handles that were opened for append-only, or

potentially read arbitrary contents, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2010-2537](/security/CVE-2010-2537), [CVE-2010-2538](/security/CVE-2010-2538))

Dave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not correctly order

inode lookups when exported by NFS. A remote attacker could exploit this to

read or write disk blocks that had changed file assignment or had become

unlinked, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-2943](/security/CVE-2010-2943))

Kees Cook discovered that the Intel i915 graphics driver did not correctly

validate memory regions. A local attacker with access to the video card

could read and write arbitrary kernel memory to gain root privileges.

([CVE-2010-2962](/security/CVE-2010-2962))

Robert Swiecki discovered that ftrace did not correctly handle mutexes. A

local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2010-3079](/security/CVE-2010-3079))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that several network ioctls did not clear kernel

memory correctly. A local user could exploit this to read kernel stack

memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-3296](/security/CVE-2010-3296), [CVE-2010-3297](/security/CVE-2010-3297),

[CVE-2010-3298](/security/CVE-2010-3298))

It was discovered that KVM did not correctly initialize certain CPU

registers. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading

to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-3698](/security/CVE-2010-3698))

Brad Spengler discovered that stack memory for new a process was not

correctly calculated. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the

system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-3858](/security/CVE-2010-3858))

Kees Cook discovered that the ethtool interface did not correctly clear

kernel memory. A local attacker could read kernel heap memory, leading to a

loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-3861](/security/CVE-2010-3861))

Kees Cook and Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the shm interface did not

clear kernel memory correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to read

kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4072](/security/CVE-2010-4072))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the RME Hammerfall DSP audio interface driver

did not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this

to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4080](/security/CVE-2010-4080),

[CVE-2010-4081](/security/CVE-2010-4081))

James Bottomley discovered that the ICP vortex storage array controller

driver did not validate certain sizes. A local attacker on a 64bit system

could exploit this to crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2010-4157](/security/CVE-2010-4157))

Alan Cox discovered that the HCI UART driver did not correctly check if a

write operation was available. If the mmap\_min-addr sysctl was changed from

the Ubuntu default to a value of 0, a local attacker could exploit this

flaw to gain root privileges. ([CVE-2010-4242](/security/CVE-2010-4242))

Kees Cook discovered that some ethtool functions did not correctly clear

heap memory. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could exploit

this to read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2010-4655](/security/CVE-2010-4655))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 10.10 kernel updates have been given a new version number,

which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel

modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules,

you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with

the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard

kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc),

a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-09-13 04:03:21 UTC  ``` Description of problem: <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/11/168> The EQL_GETMASTRCFG device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 16 bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the "master_name" member of the master_config_t struct declared on the stack in eql_g_master_cfg() is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c2)  John Kacur    2010-09-17 12:18:19 UTC  ``` This is 44467187dc22fdd33a1a06ea0ba86ce20be3fe3c in David Miller's git repo   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-10-13 04:44:45 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/44467187dc22fdd33a1a06ea0ba86ce20be3fe3c>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-14 15:30:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0771 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0771.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-11-02 05:01:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5 as they did not include support for equalizer load-balancer for serial network interfaces. This was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0771.html>.   ``` |  |

The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update to the SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP 1 Realtime Extension
kernel brings various bug and lots of security fixes.
This update also integrates upstream 2.6.33.7-rt29->2.6.33.7.2-rt30
changes.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-2962: Missing sanity checks in pread/pwrite in the i915
graphics driver allowed local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and
so gain privileges. This required a i915 graphics card to be effective.
CVE-2010-3310: Multiple integer signedness errors in net/rose/af\_rose.c
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a rose\_getname function call, related to the rose\_bind and
rose\_connect functions.
CVE-2010-3080: A double free in an alsa error path was fixed, which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-3081: Incorrect buffer handling in the biarch-compat buffer
handling could be used by local attackers to gain root privileges. This
problem affects foremost x86\_64, or potentially other biarch platforms,
like PowerPC and S390x.
CVE-2010-2960: The keyctl\_session\_to\_parent function in
security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel expects that a certain
parent session keyring exists, which allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a KEYCTL\_SESSION\_TO\_PARENT
argument to the keyctl function.
CVE-2010-3084: A buffer overflow in the ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL code
could be used to crash the kernel or potentially execute code.
CVE-2010-2955: A kernel information leak via the WEXT ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-3301: Mismatch between 32bit and 64bit register usage in the
system call entry path could be used by local attackers to gain root
privileges. This problem only affects x86\_64 kernels.
CVE-2010-3298: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/usb/hso driver.
CVE-2010-3296: Fixed a kernel information leak in the cxgb3 driver.
CVE-2010-3297: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/eql driver.
CVE-2010-3078: Fixed a kernel information leak in the xfs filesystem.
CVE-2010-3079: Fixed a ftrace NULL pointer dereference problem which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-2954: The irda\_bind function in net/irda/af\_irda.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle failure of the irda\_open\_tsap
function, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified
other impact via multiple unsuccessful calls to bind on an AF\_IRDA
(aka PF\_IRDA) socket.
CVE-2010-2959: Integer overflow in net/can/bcm.c in the Controller
Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel allowed attackers
to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (system crash)
via crafted CAN traffic.
CVE-2010-2946: The 'os2' xattr namespace on the jfs filesystem could
be used to bypass xattr namespace rules.
CVE-2010-2942: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net scheduler
code.
CVE-2010-3015: Integer overflow in the ext4\_ext\_get\_blocks function
in fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (BUG and system crash) via a write operation on
the last block of a large file, followed by a sync operation.
CVE-2010-2803: The drm\_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_drv.c
in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel
allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from
kernel memory by requesting a large memory-allocation amount.
CVE-2010-2226: The xfs\_swapext function in fs/xfs/xfs\_dfrag.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly check the file descriptors passed to
the SWAPEXT ioctl, which allowed local users to leverage write access
and obtain read access by swapping one file into another file.
CVE-2010-3849: The econet\_sendmsg function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel, when an econet address is configured, allowed
local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
and OOPS) via a sendmsg call that specifies a NULL value for the
remote address field.
CVE-2010-3848: Stack-based buffer overflow in the econet\_sendmsg
function in net/econet/af\_econet.c in the Linux kernel when an econet
address is configured, allowed local users to gain privileges by
providing a large number of iovec structures.
CVE-2010-3850: The ec\_dev\_ioctl function in net/econet/af\_econet.c
in the Linux kernel did not require the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability,
which allowed local users to bypass intended access restrictions and
configure econet addresses via an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4347: A local user could inject ACPI code into the kernel
via the world-writable "custom\_debug" file, allowing local privilege
escalation.
CVE-2010-4258: A local attacker could use a Oops (kernel crash) caused
by other flaws to write a 0 byte to a attacker controlled address
in the kernel. This could lead to privilege escalation together with
other issues.
CVE-2010-4157: A 32bit vs 64bit integer mismatch in gdth\_ioctl\_alloc
could lead to memory corruption in the GDTH driver.
CVE-2010-4165: The do\_tcp\_setsockopt function in net/ipv4/tcp.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict TCP\_MAXSEG (aka MSS)
values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS)
via a setsockopt call that specifies a small value, leading to a
divide-by-zero error or incorrect use of a signed integer.
CVE-2010-4164: A remote (or local) attacker communicating over X.25
could cause a kernel panic by attempting to negotiate malformed
facilities.
CVE-2010-4175: A local attacker could cause memory overruns in the
RDS protocol stack, potentially crashing the kernel. So far it is
considered not to be exploitable.
CVE-2010-4169: Use-after-free vulnerability in mm/mprotect.c in the
Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service via
vectors involving an mprotect system call.
CVE-2010-3874: A minor heap overflow in the CAN network module
was fixed. Due to nature of the memory allocator it is likely not
exploitable.
CVE-2010-4158: A memory information leak in Berkeley packet filter
rules allowed local attackers to read uninitialized memory of the
kernel stack.
CVE-2010-4162: A local denial of service in the blockdevice layer
was fixed.
CVE-2010-4163: By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length,
a local user could have caused a kernel panic.
CVE-2010-3861: The ethtool\_get\_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c
in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain block of heap memory,
which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information
via an ETHTOOL\_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule\_cnt
value.
CVE-2010-3881: arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structure members, which allows local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via read operations on the /dev/kvm device.
CVE-2010-3442: Multiple integer overflows in the snd\_ctl\_new function
in sound/core/control.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to
cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted (1) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD or
(2) SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_REPLACE ioctl call.
CVE-2010-3437: A range checking overflow in pktcdvd ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-4078: The sisfb\_ioctl function in drivers/video/sis/sis\_main.c
in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize a certain structure
member, which allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive
information from kernel stack memory via an FBIOGET\_VBLANK ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4080: The snd\_hdsp\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdsp.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSP\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4081: The snd\_hdspm\_hwdep\_ioctl function in
sound/pci/rme9652/hdspm.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize
a certain structure, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an
SNDRV\_HDSPM\_IOCTL\_GET\_CONFIG\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4082: The viafb\_ioctl\_get\_viafb\_info function in
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c in the Linux kernel did not properly
initialize a certain structure member, which allowed local users to
obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a VIAFB\_GET\_INFO ioctl call.
CVE-2010-4073: The ipc subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
initialize certain structures, which allowed local users to obtain
potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via
vectors related to the (1) compat\_sys\_semctl, (2) compat\_sys\_msgctl,
and (3) compat\_sys\_shmctl functions in ipc/compat.c; and the (4)
compat\_sys\_mq\_open and (5) compat\_sys\_mq\_getsetattr functions in
ipc/compat\_mq.c.
CVE-2010-4072: The copy\_shmid\_to\_user function in ipc/shm.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via vectors related to the shmctl system call and the
"old shm interface."
CVE-2010-4083: The copy\_semid\_to\_user function in ipc/sem.c in the
Linux kernel did not initialize a certain structure, which allowed
local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a (1) IPC\_INFO, (2) SEM\_INFO, (3) IPC\_STAT, or (4)
SEM\_STAT command in a semctl system call.
CVE-2010-3432: The sctp\_packet\_config function in net/sctp/output.c
in the Linux kernel performed extraneous initializations of packet
data structures, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (panic) via a certain sequence of SCTP traffic.
CVE-2010-3067: Integer overflow in the do\_io\_submit function in
fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial
of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted use
of the io\_submit system call.
CVE-2010-3865: A iovec integer overflow in RDS sockets was fixed
which could lead to local attackers gaining kernel privileges.
CVE-2010-3904: A local privilege escalation in RDS sockets allowed
local attackers to gain root privileges.
2) Solution or Work-Around
Please install the updated packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This security update of the SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 GA and openSUSE
11.1 kernel updates the kernel to 2.6.27.54 and fixes various security
issues and other bugs.
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 kernel was released last week,
the openSUSE 11.1 kernel with the same source base yesterday.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2010-3310: Multiple integer signedness errors in net/rose/af\_rose.c
in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a rose\_getname function call, related to the rose\_bind and
rose\_connect functions.
CVE-2010-2955: A kernel information leak via the WEXT ioctl was fixed.
CVE-2010-3080: A double free in an alsa error path was fixed, which
could lead to kernel crashes.
CVE-2010-3078: Fixed a kernel information leak in the xfs filesystem.
CVE-2010-3296: Fixed a kernel information leak in the cxgb3 driver.
CVE-2010-3297: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net/eql driver.
CVE-2010-2954: The irda\_bind function in net/irda/af\_irda.c in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle failure of the irda\_open\_tsap
function, which allowed local users to cause a denial of service
(NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified
other impact via multiple unsuccessful calls to bind on an AF\_IRDA
(aka PF\_IRDA) socket.
CVE-2010-2946: The 'os2' xattr namespace on the jfs filesystem could
be used to bypass xattr namespace rules.
CVE-2010-2942: Fixed a kernel information leak in the net scheduler
code.
CVE-2010-3015: Integer overflow in the ext4\_ext\_get\_blocks function
in fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to cause
a denial of service (BUG and system crash) via a write operation on
the last block of a large file, followed by a sync operation.
CVE-2010-2803: The drm\_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_drv.c
in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem in the Linux kernel
allowed local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from
kernel memory by requesting a large memory-allocation amount.
CVE-2010-2798: The gfs2\_dirent\_find\_space function in fs/gfs2/dir.c
in the Linux kernel used an incorrect size value in calculations
associated with sentinel directory entries, which allowed local users
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) and
possibly have unspecified other impact by renaming a file in a GFS2
filesystem, related to the gfs2\_rename function in fs/gfs2/ops\_inode.c.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no workaround, please install the fixed packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-09-13 04:03:21 UTC  ``` Description of problem: <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/9/11/168> The EQL_GETMASTRCFG device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 16 bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the "master_name" member of the master_config_t struct declared on the stack in eql_g_master_cfg() is not altered or zeroed before being copied back to the user.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c2)  John Kacur    2010-09-17 12:18:19 UTC  ``` This is 44467187dc22fdd33a1a06ea0ba86ce20be3fe3c in David Miller's git repo   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-10-13 04:44:45 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/44467187dc22fdd33a1a06ea0ba86ce20be3fe3c>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-14 15:30:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2010:0771 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0771.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=633145#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-11-02 05:01:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5 as they did not include support for equalizer load-balancer for serial network interfaces. This was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0771.html>.   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [linux-source-2.6.15](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.15) - ACPI support modules (udeb)

## Details

Dave Chinner discovered that the XFS filesystem did not correctly order

inode lookups when exported by NFS. A remote attacker could exploit this to

read or write disk blocks that had changed file assignment or had become

unlinked, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-2943](/security/CVE-2010-2943))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that several network ioctls did not clear kernel

memory correctly. A local user could exploit this to read kernel stack

memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-3297](/security/CVE-2010-3297))

Kees Cook and Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the shm interface did not

clear kernel memory correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to read

kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4072](/security/CVE-2010-4072))
