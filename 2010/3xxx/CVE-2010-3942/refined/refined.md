  "CVE-2010-3942": {
    "Root cause": "Improper memory allocation when copying data from user mode within Windows kernel-mode drivers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory allocation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights, resulting in elevation of privilege.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a locally logged-on user running a specially crafted application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the vulnerable system."
