Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-3468

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue caused by improper sanitization of the `FILEID` parameter within the `fileManager.cfc` component of the Blue River Mura CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input (the `FILEID` parameter), allowing an attacker to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory. This is achieved through the use of relative path traversal characters such as `..\`.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `fileManager.cfc` component does not adequately sanitize the `FILEID` parameter before using it to construct file paths, leading to the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** An unauthenticated attacker can download any file accessible to the web server by manipulating the `FILEID` parameter.
- **Unauthorized Disclosure:** Sensitive files, including configuration files and password files, can be accessed, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request.
- **Manipulated `FILEID` parameter:** The `FILEID` parameter in the URL is modified to include directory traversal sequences (`..\`) followed by the path to the target file on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable component is `fileManager.cfc`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `FILEID`.
- The proof of concept (PoC) URL provided is: `http://{hostname}/{mura_ _location}/tasks/render/file/?FILEID=..\..\..\..\..\..\ColdFusion9\lib\password.properties`
- The exploit uses `..\` to traverse up the directory tree to access files outside of the application's intended directories.

**Affected Products:**
   - Mura CMS 5.1 < 5.1.498
   - Mura CMS 5.2 < 5.2.2809
   - Sava CMS 5.2 (Unknown)
