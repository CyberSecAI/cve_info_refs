How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 1. Summary

VMware Workstation and Player address a potential installer security issue and security issues in libpng. VMware ACE Management Server (AMS) for Windows updates Apache httpd.

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware Workstation 7.1.1 and earlier,

VMware Workstation 6.5.4 and earlier,

VMware Player 3.1.1 and earlier,

VMware Player 2.5.4 and earlier,

VMware ACE Management Server 2.7.1 and earlier,

Note: VMware Server was declared End Of Availability on January 2010, support will be limited to Technical Guidance for the duration of the support term.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware Workstation and Player installer security issue

The Workstation 7.x and Player 3.x installers will load an index.htm file located in the current working directory on which Workstation 7.x or Player 3.x is being installed. This may allow an attacker to display a malicious file if they manage to get their file onto the system prior to installation.
The issue can only be exploited at the time that Workstation 7.x or Player 3.x is being installed. Installed versions of Workstation and Player are not affected. The security issue is no longer present in the installer of the new versions of Workstation 7.x and Player 3.x (see table below for the version numbers).
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-3277 to this issue.
VMware would like to thank Alexander Trofimov and Marc Esher for independently reporting this issue to VMware.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

\* Note: This only affects the installer, if you have a version of Workstation or Player installed you are not vulnerable.

#####

b. Third party libpng updated to version 1.2.44

A buffer overflow condition in libpng is addressed that could potentially lead to code execution with the privileges of the application using libpng. Two potential denial of service issues are also addressed in the update.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2010-1205, CVE-2010-0205, CVE-2010-2249 to these issues.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

c. VMware ACE Management Server (AMS) for Windows updates Apache httpd

A function in Apache HTTP Server when multithreaded MPM is used does not properly handle headers in subrequests in certain circumstances which may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted request that triggers access to memory locations associated with an earlier request.
The Apache mod\_isapi module can be forced to unload a specific library before the processing of a request is complete, resulting in memory corruption. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2010-0434 and CVE-2010-0425 to the issues addressed in this update.
Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.
