Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-3456

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability found in ES Simple Download version 1.0.
- The `download.php` script is vulnerable to LFI through the `file` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include local files through the `file` parameter in the `download.php` script.
- Improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `file` parameter, which allows relative path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files (`config.php`). This can potentially expose passwords, database credentials, and other sensitive information.
- **Potential for further compromise:** If the attacker gains access to config files or can read application code, it can assist them in further exploitation, and may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `download.php`, manipulating the `file` parameter to include arbitrary files.
-  Example URLs:
   - `www.yourscript/download.php?PHPSESSID="YourSenssid"&file=../*****`
    - `www.yourscript/download.php?PHPSESSID="YourSenssid"&file=../../config.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable script's parameters.

**Additional Notes**

- The exploit also mentions the PHPSESSID but does not elaborate on its role.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Kazza from the German Security Team (-GST-).
- The vulnerable application is ES Simple Download v1.0 which is a PHP script and is freeware.
-  The exploit also mentions that this can be a means to obtain a password. This implies configuration files may contain password information.
