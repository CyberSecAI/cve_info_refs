        "source": "docs.microsoft.com_2f746131_20250125_115140.html",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the way Microsoft Office handles the loading of DLL files. Specifically, it relates to how a vulnerable component of Microsoft Office uses a search order to locate and load libraries.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Insecure library loading"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "The primary attack vector involves convincing a user to open a document located in the same directory as a specially crafted DLL file. When the document is opened, the malicious DLL is loaded into memory.",
           "Attackers could leverage untrusted remote file system locations or WebDAV shares to deliver a malicious DLL along with a document"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted DLL file and place it in a location where a user will open a document that is stored in the same directory. This could be a network share, a WebDAV share, or a local directory the user has access to.",
		"additional_details":"The file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors."
