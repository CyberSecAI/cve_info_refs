**Vulnerable App:**

```
Advisory Name: Remote Command Execution in EGroupware

Vulnerability Class: Remote Command Execution

Release Date: 2010-03-09

Affected Applications: Confirmed in EGroupware 1.4.001+.002 and 1.6.001+.002. EGroupware

Premium Line 9.1 and 9.2 is also affected. Other versions may also be affected.

Affected Platforms: Multiple

Local / Remote: Remote

Severity: High – CVSS: 10 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Researcher: Nahuel Grisolía

Vendor Status: Acknowledged / Fixed.

Reference to Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: http://www.cybsec.com/vulnerability_policy.pdf

Reference to CYBSEC Security Advisories: http://www.cybsec.com/EN/research/default.php

Vulnerability Description:

EGroupware is prone to a remote command execution vulnerability because the software fails to
adequately sanitize user-supplied input.
Successful attacks can compromise the affected software and possibly the computer running
EGroupware.

Proof of Concept:

http://server/egroupware/phpgwapi/js/fckeditor/editor/dialog/fck_spellerpages/spellerpages/serverscripts/
spellchecker.php?aspell_path=cat%20/etc/passwd%20%3E%20/tmp/passwd;

Parameter spellchecker_lang is also affected.

Impact:

Direct execution of arbitrary code in the context of Webserver user.

Solution: Fixed in EGroupware version 1.6.003, EPL-9.1.20100309 and EPL-9.2.20100309

Vendor Response:

Feb 5, 2010 - CYBSEC first notification
Feb 8, 2010 between Mar 7, 2010 – Multiple contacts.
Mar 9, 2010 – Vendor released fixed versions.
Mar 9, 2010 – Vulnerability is published.

Advisory Name: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in EGroupware

Vulnerability Class: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Release Date: 2010-03-09

Affected Applications: Confirmed in EGroupware 1.4.001+.002 and 1.6.001+.002. EGroupware
Premium Line 9.1 and 9.2 is also affected. Other versions may also be affected.

Affected Platforms: Multiple

Local / Remote: Remote

Severity: Medium – CVSS: 5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

Researcher: Nahuel Grisolía

Vendor Status: Acknowledged / Fixed.

Reference to Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: http://www.cybsec.com/vulnerability_policy.pdf

Reference to CYBSEC Security Advisories: http://www.cybsec.com/EN/research/default.php

Vulnerability Description:

A reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in EGroupware, because the application fails
to sanitize user-supplied input. The vulnerability can be triggered by any user.

Proof of Concept:

Working on Mozilla Firefox 3.5.7:
http://server/egroupware/login.php?
lang="%20style="width:100%;height:100%;display:block;position:absolute;top:0px;left:0px"%20onM
ouseOver="alert(document.cookie)

Impact:

An affected user may unintentionally execute scripts or actions written by an attacker. In addition, an
attacker may obtain authorization cookies that would allow him to gain unauthorized access to the
application.

Solution: Fixed in EGroupware version 1.6.003, EPL-9.1.20100309 and EPL-9.2.20100309

Vendor Response:

Feb 5, 2010 - CYBSEC first notification
Feb 8, 2010 between Mar 7, 2010 – Multiple contacts.
Mar 9, 2010 – Vendor released fixed versions.
Mar 9, 2010 – Vulnerability is published.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Package        : egroupware
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : not yet available
Debian Bug     : 573279

Nahuel Grisolia discovered two vulnerabilities in Egroupware, a web-based
groupware suite: Missing input sanitising in the spellchecker integration
may lead to the execution of arbitrary commands and a cross-site scripting
vulnerability was discovered in the login page.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.004-2.dfsg-4.2.

The upcoming stable distribution (squeeze), no longer contains egroupware
packages.

We recommend that you upgrade your egroupware packages.
