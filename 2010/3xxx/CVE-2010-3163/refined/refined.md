  "CVE-2010-3163": {
    "Description": "Sleipnir and Grani may use unsafe methods for determining how to load DLLs.",
    "Root cause": "The applications use an insecure method for determining how to load DLLs. Specifically, they have an issue with the DLL search path.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Dynamic Library Loading"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker may execute arbitrary code with the privilege of running the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL and placing it in a location where the application might load it instead of the legitimate one. This can be triggered when opening a crafted HTML file.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted HTML file to a user who will open it with the vulnerable software, or place a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by the vulnerable software."
