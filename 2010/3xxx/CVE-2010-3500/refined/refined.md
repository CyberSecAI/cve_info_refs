  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist across various Oracle products and components.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote code execution",
      "Information disclosure",
      "Denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service. An attacker compromising an Oracle database could access sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote, unauthenticated attacks are possible depending on the vulnerable component.",
        "In the case of the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control, a specially crafted HTML file, likely hosted on a malicious website, can be used to trigger the vulnerability when a user accesses it."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to entice a user to interact with malicious content (e.g., visit a malicious website). Some vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely without authentication, while others require authentication."
