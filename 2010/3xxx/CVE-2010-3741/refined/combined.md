GMGruman writes *"InfoWorld blogger Martin Heller reveals that a Russian passcode-breaker developer has [broken the encryption used in BlackBerry backups](http://www.infoworld.com/t/mobile-device-management/you-can-no-longer-rely-encryption-protect-blackberry-436). That can help recover data when passwords are lost, but also gives data thieves access to a treasure trove of corporate secrets. And the developer boasts that it was easier to crack the BlackBerry encryption than it was to crack Apple's iOS."*

  Notice how the blackberry adds have shifted from being about business apps and security to how cool it is that you can edit a MP3 playlist.

  Whole thing smacks of desperation.

    Adding is easier than factoring primes. This might have something to do with the security problem.

        Well, it's true: adding IS easier than factoring primes. It's also easier than dividing by zero, trisecting an angle with a compass and straightedge, and calculating the last digit of pi.

            Nope, you're wrong. The last digit of pi is zero.

            This is because pi is exactly 10 (base pi).

    Probably because it was only a few years ago that there was no other serious business phone that did a half-decent job of email and had management features built right in (such as encforcing endpoint encryption and remote wiping).

    Now more-or-less every smartphone offers such features, and non-smart phones are rapidly starting to look like an endangered species. Blackberry no longer offer anything particularly special.

    Well, initially the Black Berry was a corporate device. Then a lot of consumers decided they want one so they could do messaging and email.

    However, Apple and other manufacturers have been making smart phones which have *way* more consumer features than business and have been correspondingly taking a *lot* of market share away from RIM. In

      Um, no. My last two jobs mandated them. They work exceptionally well in a business environment, and while I love the iPhone it's not yet as good for the enterprise. So for personal use, "don't get one hurr" may work, for the majority of bberry users it's not an option. That being said, most users don't back it up - if you're tied to exchange, all the important stuff is synched to it and all you need to do with a new bberry is to associate it to the same acct.

    It is still a hole though, and one that is completely preventable. Most serious crypto products around uses key strengthening, be it KeePass with its variable number of rounds that are user selectable, TrueCrypt with its 1000 rounds, or iOS 4's 10,000 rounds. Heck, even the venerable crypt(3) mechanism had a number of rounds to slow down people running Crack over 20 years ago back before passwords were stored in /etc/shadow.

    How can this be fixed? Use a reasonable amount of rounds (enough so it slows down brute forcing, but not too many that it kills day to day normal operation.) Also, use a salt, so rainbow table pre-computation of keys is impossible.

    In the meantime, the parent poster probably has the best solution. For maximum security, add a cryptographic token and store a TC keyfile on that. This way, if someone tries to brute force the token's passphrase, they have 3-20 tries before the token permanently fries itself.

  The encryption itself is just fine (at least, for now). While it's interesting that the data is transmitted in the clear and then encrypted by the backup software, they don't propose exploiting this (which would be an inconvenient attack).

  This is simply a brute-force password cracker that's specific to BlackBerry backups. It's not particularly specific, either, as the backups are encrypted with AES and the key is derived from a password using the standard PBKDF2. There are tons of PBKDF2-crackers out there (like coWPAtty). The surprising thing is that they only use single-iteration PBKDF2, which is a joke.

  This, incidentally, is what is meant by the statement in TFS that cracking BlackBerry backup passwords is easier than cracking iOS passwords. Difficulty in password cracking (amount of computational time per password) for PBKDF2 is roughly proportional to the number of iterations. IIRC, WPA uses 4096, Apple's FileVault uses 1000, and BlackBerry backups apparently use 1.

  This "weakness" seems a little silly.

  You typically make your backups on your office desktop PC, and leave them there. But all the sensitive data in the backup file was already there on that same PC, in your corporate mailbox, completely unencrypted.

  Cracking a Blackberry backup file would be the hardest way to get access to that data.

  The NSA announced today that they are offering secured online backup for all Blackberry users. RIMM responded saying they were surprised how quickly the DNS poison spread but wish the NSA well in their user friendly backup service. Many Middle East governments are also now offering the easy secure backup service as well.

  So, it takes 3 days to crack the 7 character password. Adding 8 characters to the set (say, !@#$%^&\*) would then increase that 3 days to...

    2^21 more effort. Or, roughly 3 to 4 million days. Seems from the discussion that elcomsoft was able to brute force quickly (millions of passwords per second).

  Add a few more characters and the effort to brute-force the thing goes up... exponentially. Unless, of course, elcomsoft has actually "cracked" the encryption, and not simply reduced the time to try a key.

  What I would warn about is my "usual" advice for password generation (optional random character) word (optional random character) word (optional random character), because, as far as I can tell, that can be now be broken by elcomsoft in 2 to 3 days (assuming they know that this is the pattern used, which we have to).

  Very curious to see a review of this (before panic sets in).

  Both the headline and the article are overheated.

  The "crack" requires that

  1. You have information that needs to be secured on your BB;
  2. In spite of that you've used a toy password; and
  3. The enemy has access to your backup files.

  More than a bit of a stretch.
