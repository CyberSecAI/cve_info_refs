Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3326:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an uninitialized memory corruption vulnerability. This occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. This can lead to memory corruption that an attacker can exploit to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Uninitialized Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of object initialization or deletion in memory, specifically in how Internet Explorer accesses these objects.
-   **Memory Corruption:** Accessing an uninitialized or deleted object corrupts memory in a way that allows for code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
-   **System Compromise:** Complete control of the system enables the attacker to:
    -   Install programs
    -   View, change, or delete data
    -   Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Specially Crafted Web Page:** An attacker can create a malicious web page designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
-   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content, which when viewed can exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Embedded ActiveX Control:** An attacker could embed an ActiveX control marked as "safe for initialization" within a malicious application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Host Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or inject malicious content into a website.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website, click a malicious link, or open a malicious file (e.g. through email or instant messaging).
-   **No Direct User Interaction Required**: The vulnerability is triggered when the user views the crafted content, not by a specific user action on the page itself.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed when the security bulletin was issued.
-   Microsoft had not received reports of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild at the time of the bulletin's release.
-   Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server 2003 and 2008 can mitigate the risk by setting the security level for the Internet zone to High.
