  "CVE-2010-3311": {
    "description": "The FreeType font rendering engine improperly validated certain position values when processing input streams. If a user loaded a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType, and the relevant font glyphs were subsequently rendered with the X FreeType library (libXft), it could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow in the libXft library, causing the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Input stream position error when processing Compact Font Format (CFF) font files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of position values in FreeType input stream processing",
	"Heap-based buffer overflow in libXft due to integer overflow."
      ],
      "impact": "Application crash or arbitrary code execution with user privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Loading a specially-crafted font file with an application linked against FreeType.",
	 "Rendering the font glyphs with the X FreeType library (libXft)."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create or obtain a specially crafted font file. The user needs to be tricked into loading the malformed file. Also, the application needs to link against FreeType and use libXft for font rendering.",
