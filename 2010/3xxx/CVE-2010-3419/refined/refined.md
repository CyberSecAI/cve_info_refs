{
  "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to `familynews.php` and `settings.php` with a modified `current_user_id` parameter to include malicious remote files."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required."
