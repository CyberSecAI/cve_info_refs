# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-67

## Dangling pointer vulnerability in LookupGetterOrSetter

Announced
October 19, 2010
Reporter
regenrecht
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.14
* Firefox 3.6.11
* SeaMonkey 2.0.9
* Thunderbird 3.0.9
* Thunderbird 3.1.5

### Description

Security researcher **regenrecht** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that
when `window.__lookupGetter__` is called with no arguments
the code assumes the top JavaScript stack value is a property name.
Since there were no arguments passed into the function, the top value
could represent uninitialized memory or a pointer to a previously
freed JavaScript object. Under such circumstances the value is passed
to another subroutine which calls through the dangling pointer,
potentially executing attacker-controlled memory.

-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists in js3250.dll. When a JavaObject is created and deleted, there is not a proper sanity check for the LookupGetterorSetter() function, which can result in a dangling pointer being passed to the JS\_ValueToId() function. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.
Version(s) tested: Mozilla Firefox 3.6.8
Platform(s) tested: Windows XP SP3 x86
From js/src/xpconnect/src/xpcquickstubs.cpp:
JSBool
xpc\_qsDefineQuickStubs(JSContext \*cx, JSObject \*proto, uintN flags,
PRUint32 ifacec, const nsIID \*\*interfaces,
PRUint32 tableSize, const xpc\_qsHashEntry \*table) {
...
static JSFunctionSpec getterfns[] = {
JS\_FN("\_\_lookupGetter\_\_", SharedLookupGetter, 1, 0),
JS\_FN("\_\_lookupSetter\_\_", SharedLookupSetter, 1, 0),
JS\_FN("\_\_defineGetter\_\_", SharedDefineGetter, 2, 0),
JS\_FN("\_\_defineSetter\_\_", SharedDefineSetter, 2, 0),
JS\_FS\_END
};
if(definedProperty && !JS\_DefineFunctions(cx, proto, getterfns))
return JS\_FALSE;
return JS\_TRUE;
}
static JSBool
SharedLookupGetter(JSContext \*cx, uintN argc, jsval \*vp) {
return LookupGetterOrSetter(cx, PR\_TRUE, vp); }
static JSBool
LookupGetterOrSetter(JSContext \*cx, JSBool wantGetter, jsval \*vp) {
...
JSObject \*obj = JS\_THIS\_OBJECT(cx, vp);
if (!obj)
return JS\_FALSE;
jsval idval = JS\_ARGV(cx, vp)[0];
const char \*name = JSVAL\_IS\_STRING(idval)
? JS\_GetStringBytes(JSVAL\_TO\_STRING(idval))
: nsnull;
if(!JS\_ValueToId(cx, idval, &interned\_id) ||
!JS\_LookupPropertyWithFlagsById(cx, obj, interned\_id,
JSRESOLVE\_QUALIFIED, &obj2, &v) ||
(obj2 &&
!JS\_GetPropertyAttrsGetterAndSetterById(cx, obj2, interned\_id, &attrs,
&found, &getter, &setter)))
return JS\_FALSE;
...
}
Function LookupGetterOrSetter() lacks important sanity check: it assumes that there was at least one argument passed from caller. When \_\_lookupGetter\_\_ is called with no arguments on JavaScript stack, JS\_ARGV(cx, vp)[0] returns jsval which represents potentially uninitialized memory (or some leftovers from previous computations?). This, for example, can be a pointer to already freed JS object. Such dangling pointer is later passed to JS\_ValueToId().

We should not assume this is "it". There's never only one cockroach.
bhackett says sixgill can find any more statically -- cc'ing him to confirm based on details.

Would be cool to write a static analysis that can find the bug in the old code and then see what else it flags. I like it.

I should have reports from sixgill on read overflows of 64-bit quantities (to catch both jsval[] and js::Value[]) tomorrow or Friday. The tool is (nearly) sound so will definitely find this bug, the challenge is getting it to reliably identify correct handlers. Will probably need a little iteration to get the right annotations where fast natives are called.

It's got a separate testcase, that appears to have different behavior at least on 1.9.1.x. "Depends on" is better so we don't forget to verify both testcases after the fix.Assignee: gal → mrbkapDepends on: [509075](/show_bug.cgi?id=509075 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ js_ValueToString]")Whiteboard: [sg:critical] → [sg:critical] fixed on trunk by 509075

Package        : xulrunner
Vulnerability  : several

Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3765 CVE-2010-3174 CVE-2010-3176 CVE-2010-3177 CVE-2010-3178 CVE-2010-3179 CVE-2010-3180 CVE-2010-3183

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, the
component that provides the core functionality of Iceweasel, Debian's
variant of Mozilla's browser technology.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2010-3765
	Xulrunner allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
	via vectors related to nsCSSFrameConstructor::ContentAppended,
	the appendChild method, incorrect index tracking, and the
	creation of multiple frames, which triggers memory corruption.

CVE-2010-3174
CVE-2010-3176
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine in
	Xulrunner allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	(memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2010-3177
	Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the
	Gopher parser in Xulrunner allow remote attackers to inject
	arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted name of a (1) file
	or (2) directory on a Gopher server.

CVE-2010-3178
	Xulrunner does not properly handle certain modal calls made by
	javascript: URLs in circumstances related to opening a new
	window and performing cross-domain navigation, which allows
	remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a
	crafted HTML document.

CVE-2010-3179
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the text-rendering
	functionality in Xulrunner allows remote attackers to execute
	arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption
	and application crash) via a long argument to the
	document.write method.

CVE-2010-3180
	Use-after-free vulnerability in the nsBarProp function in
	Xulrunner allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
	accessing the locationbar property of a closed window.

CVE-2010-3183
	The LookupGetterOrSetter function in Xulrunner does not
	properly support window.__lookupGetter__ function calls that
	lack arguments, which allows remote attackers to execute
	arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer
	dereference and application crash) via a crafted HTML
	document.

In addition, this security update includes corrections for regressions
caused by the fixes for CVE-2010-0654 and CVE-2010-2769 in DSA-2075-1
and DSA-2106-1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.19-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable
distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.15-1 of the iceweasel package.

We recommend that you upgrade your Xulrunner packages.

firefox security update (RHSA-2010-0782)

Original Release Date: November 16, 2010

Last Revised: June 21, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-321

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 7.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox. Network Security Services (NSS) is
a set of libraries designed to support the development of security-enabled
client and server applications.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2010-3175](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3175.html),
[CVE-2010-3176](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3176.html),
[CVE-2010-3179](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3179.html),
[CVE-2010-3183](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3183.html) and
[CVE-2010-3180](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3180.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way the Gopher parser in Firefox converted text
into HTML. A malformed file name on a Gopher server could, when accessed by
a victim running Firefox, allow arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the
context of the Gopher domain. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3177](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3177.html) to this issue.

A same-origin policy bypass flaw was found in Firefox. An attacker could
create a malicious web page that, when viewed by a victim, could steal
private data from a different website the victim has loaded with Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3178](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3178.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the script that launches Firefox. The LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
variable was appending a "." character, which could allow a local attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different user running
Firefox, if that user ran Firefox from within an attacker-controlled
directory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3182.html) to this issue.

It was found that the SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode
implementation for key exchanges in Firefox accepted DHE keys that were 256
bits in length. This update removes support for 256 bit DHE keys, as such
keys are easily broken using modern hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3173](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3173.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way NSS matched SSL certificates when the
certificates had a Common Name containing a wildcard and a partial IP
address. NSS incorrectly accepted connections to IP addresses that fell
within the SSL certificate's wildcard range as valid SSL connections,
possibly allowing an attacker to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-3170](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3170.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
When certain factors determine that the overall risk for a particular product to be set to Low,
Avaya will place these factors in the following table:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-3170 CVE-2010-3173 CVE-2010-3175 CVE-2010-3176 CVE-2010-3177 CVE-2010-3178 CVE-2010-3179 CVE-2010-3180 CVE-2010-3182 CVE-2010-3183 | These vulnerabilities are rated a Low risk as firefox is not a critical application on IALX, MN and MSS and is not installed on AES, CM, Conferencing, IQ, Presence, SM, SMGR, SP, VP or the CS1000. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## Details

Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov, Josh Soref, Gary

Kwong, Martijn Wargers, Siddharth Agarwal and Michal Zalewski discovered

various flaws in the browser engine. An attacker could exploit this to

crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-3175](/security/CVE-2010-3175), [CVE-2010-3176](/security/CVE-2010-3176))

Alexander Miller, Sergey Glazunov, and others discovered several flaws in

the JavaScript engine. An attacker could exploit this to crash the browser

or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3179](/security/CVE-2010-3179), [CVE-2010-3180](/security/CVE-2010-3180), [CVE-2010-3183](/security/CVE-2010-3183))

Robert Swiecki discovered that Firefox did not properly validate Gopher

URLs. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted file via Gopher, an

attacker could possibly run arbitrary JavaScript. ([CVE-2010-3177](/security/CVE-2010-3177))

Eduardo Vela Nava discovered that Firefox could be made to violate the

same-origin policy by using modal calls with JavaScript. An attacker could

exploit this to steal information from another site. ([CVE-2010-3178](/security/CVE-2010-3178))

Dmitri GribenkoDmitri Gribenko discovered that Firefox did not properly

setup the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable. A local attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3182](/security/CVE-2010-3182))

specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - mail/news client with RSS and integrated spam filter support

## Details

Paul Nickerson, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay, Igor Bukanov, Josh Soref, Gary

Kwong, Martijn Wargers, Siddharth Agarwal and Michal Zalewski discovered

various flaws in the browser engine. An attacker could exploit this to

crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-3175](/security/CVE-2010-3175), [CVE-2010-3176](/security/CVE-2010-3176))

Alexander Miller, Sergey Glazunov, and others discovered several flaws in

the JavaScript engine. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker could

exploit this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3179](/security/CVE-2010-3179), [CVE-2010-3180](/security/CVE-2010-3180), [CVE-2010-3183](/security/CVE-2010-3183))

Eduardo Vela Nava discovered that Thunderbird could be made to violate the

same-origin policy by using modal calls with JavaScript. If JavaScript were

enabled, an attacker could exploit this to steal information from another

site. ([CVE-2010-3178](/security/CVE-2010-3178))

Dmitri GribenkoDmitri Gribenko discovered that Thunderbird did not properly

setup the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable. A local attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-3182](/security/CVE-2010-3182))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [3.1.5+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/3.1.5%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [3.0.9+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/3.0.9%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make all

the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
