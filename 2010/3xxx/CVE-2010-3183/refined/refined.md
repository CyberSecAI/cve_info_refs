{
  "CVE-2010-3183": {
    "description": "The LookupGetterOrSetter function in Xulrunner does not properly support window.__lookupGetter__ function calls that lack arguments, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted HTML document.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `LookupGetterOrSetter` function assumes that at least one argument is passed from the caller. When `window.__lookupGetter__` is called without arguments, it uses an uninitialized memory value (or a pointer to a previously freed object) as a property name. This leads to a dangling pointer being passed to `JS_ValueToId()` function, causing a crash or potentially executing attacker-controlled memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Dangling pointer dereference",
        "Lack of input validation",
        "Use of uninitialized memory"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service via application crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Visiting a malicious web page",
         "Opening a malicious HTML file"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious HTML document that invokes `window.__lookupGetter__` without arguments.",
      "attacker_position": "Remote, attacker needs to induce a user to open malicious HTML content."
