The provided content discusses the release of Google Chrome 5.0.375.127, which includes several security fixes. One of the fixes is a workaround for a critical vulnerability in an external component, specifically a Windows kernel bug. The release notes credit Marc Schoenefeld for finding the bug and enabling the workaround. The content also mentions other security fixes related to memory corruption, bad cast, and address bar spoofing.

Although the content mentions a critical vulnerability in an external component (Windows kernel), the vulnerability itself isn't described here, but only the workaround deployed by Chrome. Since the CVE description is a placeholder, it is not possible to verify it fully against the document. However, it can be determined that this external component issue was a critical issue and required a workaround.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A critical vulnerability exists in an external component, specifically the Windows kernel.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness lies within a Windows kernel bug, which is an external component to Chrome. The nature of the bug itself is not revealed in this document.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:  The impact of the kernel bug is described as critical.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector isn't detailed, but it likely involves exploiting a vulnerability in the Windows kernel.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need the capability to trigger the vulnerability in the Windows kernel.

While the content doesn't detail the exact vulnerability or exploit method, it clearly indicates a critical security issue in the Windows kernel and the workaround that was deployed in Chrome.
