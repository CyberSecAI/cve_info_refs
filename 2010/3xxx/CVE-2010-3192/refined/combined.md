For the sake of correctness, protective technology that kicks in in the
Dan's example is stack protector, not FORTIFY_SOURCE.  Though it's
probably still glibc to blame for using the same error-reporting
function in both cases.

It seems the fix would need to remove all possibly-useful info from the
error message.

Hi,
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Apr/399>
did this ever get a CVE id? As this also works for setuid programs it would be
nice to get one assigned and have this patched.

Kind regards
Nico

You are correct.  Both the __stack_chk_fail(), which is inserted due
to stack protection, and the more general __chk_fail(), which is
inserted due to FORTIFY_SOURCE and may trigger for static buffer
overflows in other segments, call out to the same __fortify_fail()
function to print out the stack trace.

The backtrace or memory map don't really contain any potentially
sensitive information that couldn't be obtained otherwise.  It's just
the reference to argv[0] (in glibc/debug/fortify_fail.c) that worries
me, because this can be directly influenced to cause a printout of
process memory.

I think this technically qualifies as an "exposure" which is the "E" in
"CVE" - it can be used as a stepping stone for exploitation of another
vulnerability.  (Very old, unwieldy definitions here:
<http://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html>)

The risk may be very minimal, but the FORTIFY_SOURCE protection mechanism
is not working "as advertised" - it can be manipulated for an
admittedly-small information leak.

Use CVE-2010-3192 for the issue.

In case of stack protector failed check, it's still an attempt to
print-out info based on what's known to be (partially) corrupted.

Steve,

What is MITRE policy on this one. By itself I question if this is a
security flaw, but it also would appear to have the potential to turn a DoS
into something worse.

I'm not sure what policy is in this instance.

Thanks.

I retract my previous statement - you're correct that the backtrace
also can reveal this same information.  Perhaps this is an acceptable
risk, since I can't think of a single real-life case where this would
have actually been useful to an attacker (although it's not too hard
to imagine such a situation).  Or perhaps printing out any of this
information to unprivileged users running suid applications should be
reconsidered.

# Fun with FORTIFY\_SOURCE

```
I wanted to share a neat little trick I discovered while playing with
gcc's FORTIFY_SOURCE feature.  For those who don't know, this feature
attempts to prevent exploitation of a subset of buffer overflows by
inserting a set of checks at compile-time, including stack canaries
for some functions.  It's enabled by default in many cases.  In
particular, when FORTIFY_SOURCE detects an overflow, it aborts
execution and prints an error message that might look similar to the
following:

*** stack smashing detected ***: ./strcpy terminated
======= Backtrace: =========
/lib/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x40)[0x502b30]
/lib/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x0)[0x502af0]
./strcpy[0x80484d5]
[0x41414141]
======= Memory map: ========
...
Aborted

Notice that this error message contains a reference to the
application's name, which is obtained by simply relying on argv[0].
Assuming the application was aborted because of a controllable
stack-based buffer overflow, in some cases an attacker may be able to
continue overflowing past the vulnerable buffer, overwriting the
argv[0] pointer, causing the error message to print arbitrary memory
addresses, as in the following contrived example:

$ ./strcpy `perl -e 'print "\xa0\x85\x04\x08"x80'`

*** stack smashing detected ***: THIS IS A SECRET terminated
======= Backtrace: =========
/lib/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x40)[0x1f3b30]
/lib/libc.so.6(__fortify_fail+0x0)[0x1f3af0]
THIS IS A SECRET[0x80484d5]
THIS IS A SECRET[0x80485a0]
======= Memory map: ========
...
Aborted

If an attacker ever stumbles upon a setuid application with an
overflow that's caught by FORTIFY_SOURCE, this may be used to read the
application's address space (which may contain sensitive information),
even if code execution is mitigated.  Because it relies on the
existence of another vulnerability, I wouldn't consider this a serious
issue by any means, but it's probably something that's worth fixing
eventually.

Happy hacking,
Dan Rosenberg
