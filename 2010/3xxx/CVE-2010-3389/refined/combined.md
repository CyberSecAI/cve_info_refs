Subject: cluster-agents: CVE-2010-3389: insecure library loading
Date: Thu, 30 Sep 2010 00:36:56 +0000
```
Package: cluster-agents
Version: 1:1.0.3-3
Severity: important
Tags: security
User: team@security.debian.org
Usertags: ldpath

Hello,

During a review of the Debian archive, I've found your package to
contain a script that can be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code.

The vulnerability is introduced by an insecure change to
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, an environment variable used by ld.so(8) to look for
libraries on a directory other than the standard paths.

Vulnerable code follows:

/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/SAPDatabase line 969:
if [ `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | grep -c "^$DIR_EXECUTABLE\>"` -eq 0 ]; then
/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/SAPDatabase line 970:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/SAPInstance line 299:
  if [ `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | grep -c "^$DIR_EXECUTABLE\>"` -eq 0 ]; then
/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/SAPInstance line 300:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

When there's an empty item on the colon-separated list of
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so treats it as '.' (i.e. CWD/$PWD.)
If the given script is executed from a directory where a potential,
local, attacker can write files to, there's a chance to exploit this
bug.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE id [CVE-2010-3389](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3389). Please make sure
you mention it when forwarding this report to upstream and when fixing
this bug (everywhere: upstream and here at Debian.)

Raphael Geissert

The following diff shows how I fixed "qtparted: [CVE-2010-3375](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3375): insecure
library loading" bug.

-export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
+LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$( echo "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" | sed "s/\s//g" )
+if [ -n "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ]
+then
+      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
+else
+      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$QTDIR/lib"
+fi
 export PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH

Please note that if you also set PATH as above, you'll have to check
$PATH before adding it with ":$PATH" to PATH.

if $PATH is empty then ":$PATH" is equivalent to ":." and you don't want
to add "." to the path search.

Thanks Aníbal,

poking a little further it seems that the problem has been addressed
by the following recent upstream patch. Do you have any thoughts on it?

So it is run periodically by root (well, the lrmd, as root).
Even though the cwd of lrmd should be ok, permission wise, in case the
script does cd into somewhere (I don't think it does, now) where someone
with lesser privilege was able to place some evil *.so, the next command
executed by the script may do interesting things.

Ok.

Simply doing
#remove it, if present.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH#"$DIR_EXECUTABLE"}
#remove possible remaining leading :
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH#:}
#prepend it
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
#remove possible trailing :
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH%:}

Would do away with the empty component as well as the if [ `echo | grep` ].

DIR_EXECUTABLE=/tmp/bin; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/lib:/var/tmp/lib; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:}$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
+ DIR_EXECUTABLE=/tmp/bin
+ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/lib:/var/tmp/lib
+ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/bin:/tmp/lib:/var/tmp/lib

It works if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is well defined (see above) but it doesn't
(still vulnerable) if LD_LIBRARY_PATH has a space or a ':' only (see
below).

DIR_EXECUTABLE=/tmp/bin; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=' '; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:}$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
+ DIR_EXECUTABLE=/tmp/bin
+ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=' '
+ LD_LIBRARY_PATH='/tmp/bin: '

DIR_EXECUTABLE=/tmp/bin; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=':'; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:}$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
+ DIR_EXECUTABLE=/tmp/bin
+ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:
+ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/bin::

```

Hi Jari,

Its unclear to me that this patch covers all cases.

e.g

$ DIR_EXECUTABLE=/abc
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="::"
$ /bin/echo "$DIR_EXECUTABLE${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
/abc:::

Am I missing something?

Nice catch. Here is an update that incorporates this:

    Ldpath ()
    {
       # Vulnerability fix for insecure library loading
       # Make sure "::", "^:" or ":$" is not in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

       local tmp
       tmp=$(echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | sed -e 's/::\+// ; s/^:// ; s/:$//' )

       [ "$tmp" ] && echo "$tmp"
    }

    ( DIR_EXECUTABLE=/abc
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="::"
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$DIR_EXECUTABLE${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
      Ldpath
    )

    # => abc

Julien Cristau from release team suggests that:

    IRC #debian-qa

    <jcristau> if the user set LD_LIBRARY_PATH="::" then they shot

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-30 17:01:12 UTC  ``` Raphael Geissert conducted a review of various packages in Debian and found that cluster-agents contained a script that could be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary code [1].  The vulnerability is due to an insecure change to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and environment variable used by ld.so(8) to look for libraries in directories other than the standard paths.  When there is an empty item in the colon-separated list of directories in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so(8) treats it as a '.' (current working directory).  If the given script is executed from a directory where a local attacker could write files, there is a chance for exploitation.  In Fedora, resource-agents contains rgmanager, which has the same scripts as Debian's cluster-agents.  /usr/share/cluster/SAPDatabase and /usr/share/cluster/SAPInstance both re-set LD_LIBRARY_PATH insecurely:  # as root user we need the library path to the SAP kernel to be able to call executables if [ `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | grep -c "^$DIR_EXECUTABLE\>"` -eq 0 ]; then    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH fi  A solution is to patch the scripts to properly set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/foo${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}  This issue has been assigned the name [CVE-2010-3389](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3389).  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=598549>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-30 17:02:28 UTC  ``` Created resource-agents tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 639045](show_bug.cgi?id=639045 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2010-3389 rgmanager: insecure library loading vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c3)  Lon Hohberger    2011-01-20 19:43:17 UTC  ``` I doublechecked that DIR_EXECUTABLE is always set to something when prior to the current resetting of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  It is; consequently the patch, as more or less suggested, will work:  -  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH +  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIR_EXECUTABLE${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH} +  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-01-31 15:55:28 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Raphael Geissert for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c5)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2011-02-08 08:06:46 UTC  ``` <http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=resource-agents.git;a=commitdiff;h=394c23c8f9e1e0fb934ba994e2e5a786467d6bec>  Patch available upstream, will be part of the upcoming release/update   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-02-16 15:09:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    CLuster Suite for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2011:0264 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0264.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-21 10:43:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:1000 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1000.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-21 12:29:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:1000 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1000.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=639044#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 12:02:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1580 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1580.html>   ``` |  |
