Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2010-3987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within HP Insight Control virtual machine management for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The primary vulnerability is XSS. The specific type of XSS (stored, reflected, DOM-based) is not specified in this document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser when they interact with the vulnerable application. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, or defacing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack requires some level of user interaction (AC:M) and no authentication is required (Au:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application's input fields or parameters, which the application then outputs without proper sanitization. 
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication. They just need to lure a victim into accessing the crafted URL or trigger the vulnerable page.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to interact with the malicious script.

**CVSS Score:**
- The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N), which indicates a moderate severity. The vector details that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network, that the attack requires medium complexity, no authentication is required, and the impact is limited to partial confidentiality compromise.

**Affected Software:**
- HP Insight Control virtual machine management versions prior to v6.2.

**Resolution:**
- The vulnerability is resolved in HP Insight Control virtual machine management v6.2 or later. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or subsequent versions.
