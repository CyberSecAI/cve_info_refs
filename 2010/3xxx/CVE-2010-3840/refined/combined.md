Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3677 CVE-2010-3680 CVE-2010-3681 CVE-2010-3682 CVE-2010-3833 CVE-2010-3834 CVE-2010-3835 CVE-2010-3836 CVE-2010-3837 CVE-2010-3838 CVE-2010-3840

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2010-3677

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) via a join query that uses a
  table with a unique SET column.

CVE-2010-3680

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by creating temporary tables
  while using InnoDB, which triggers an assertion failure.

CVE-2010-3681

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by using the HANDLER interface
  and performing "alternate reads from two indexes on a table," which
  triggers an assertion failure.

CVE-2010-3682

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled use of EXPLAIN with
  certain queries.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3833

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled propagation during
  evaluation of arguments to extreme-value functions.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3834

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled materializing a derived
  table that required a temporary table for grouping.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3835

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain user-variable
  assignment expressions that are evaluated in a logical expression context.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3836

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled pre-evaluation of LIKE
  predicates during view preparation.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3837

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled using GROUP_CONCAT()
  and WITH ROLLUP together.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3838

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain queries using a
  mixed list of numeric and LONGBLOB arguments to the GREATEST() or
  LEAST() functions.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3840

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled improper WKB data
  passed to the PolyFromWKB() function.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.51a-24+lenny5

The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5.0 anymore.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help diagnose
the problem, but since we have already crashed, something is definitely wrong
and this may fail.

key_buffer_size=8384512
read_buffer_size=131072
max_used_connections=1
max_threads=151
threads_connected=1
It is possible that mysqld could use up to
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 338112 K
bytes of memory
Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.
