- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not check if memory allocation was successful before using the allocated memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to validate if memory allocation was successful, leading to a potential null pointer dereference. Specifically, after attempting to allocate a buffer for packet data, the application does not verify if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails (e.g., due to insufficient memory), the application proceeds to use the returned null pointer, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote denial of service (DoS) of the Cisco Unified Personal Communicator.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending network packets to the application that triggers the vulnerable code path in the `eyeBeamAsDLLk9.dll` module. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable application remotely.
