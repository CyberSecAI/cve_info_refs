Remote Denial of Service Vulnerability
DoS
Cisco Unified Personal Communicator is a powerful communication platform for business, name CUPC later used for simplicity. Fuzzing CUPC, revealed that application is not freeing allocated memory for received data and is not performing any validation if memory allocation was successful. The mentioned finding allowed us to prepare proof of concept exploit that using this issue, causes remote Denial of Service of CUPC. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. Denial of Service is caused by not handled access violation exception thrown in DLL module eyeBeamAsDLLk9. Application after allocating buffer for packet data is not validating if memory allocation was successful. If memory allocation fails we have null pointer dereference. Memory allocation will fail when process used all available user mode memory which can be used by heap manager.
