### CVE-2010-3449: Apache Continuum CSRF vulnerability
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Apache Continuum does not verify the source of the request when changing user credentials, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Specifically, the application does not check the origin of the request, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious page that, when viewed by a logged-in administrator, can change their credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could create a specially crafted page that, when viewed by a logged-in administrator, would silently change the administrator's password or other credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access, loss of control over the application, and potentially further compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted web page containing malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML page. The victim must be a logged-in administrator and needs to visit the attacker's page, triggering the CSRF attack.

### CVE-2010-3449: Apache Archiva CSRF Vulnerability
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Apache Archiva does not check which form sends credentials, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not validate the origin of requests when users change their credentials
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create a malicious page that, when viewed by an administrator, can force the administrator to change their credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious web page and trick an Archiva administrator into viewing it while logged into Archiva.

The fix for both vulnerabilities involved adding a referrer check to the security interceptor for all secured actions and adding a prompt for the administrator's password when changing a user account.
