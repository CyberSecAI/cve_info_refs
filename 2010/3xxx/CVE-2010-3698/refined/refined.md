```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module. When KVM_RUN ioctl is invoked with an invalid selector in the fs and/or gs registers (achieved through LDT modifications), it causes a kernel panic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Invalid selector handling in KVM",
      "Lack of proper validation or sanitization of selectors in fs/gs registers during KVM_RUN ioctl."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a kernel panic, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This can cause the virtual machine to crash or halt.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating the Local Descriptor Table (LDT) to set invalid selectors in the fs and/or gs registers. Subsequently, an attacker invokes the KVM_RUN ioctl, which triggers the kernel panic.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the LDT and invoke the KVM_RUN ioctl. This typically requires some level of privilege, such as being a user with access to the KVM device or having control over a virtual machine.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability was fixed in Linux kernel version 2.6.36."
