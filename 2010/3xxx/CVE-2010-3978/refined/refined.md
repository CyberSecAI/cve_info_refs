{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application's REST API did not require a valid authentication token in the request header, and GET requests for JSON views did not require a CSRF token, making it vulnerable to JSON hijacking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient authentication",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially access sensitive data through the API and perform unauthorized actions, including modifying user data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "JSON hijacking via GET requests to JSON views",
      "Accessing REST API without a valid token in the header"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious page or performing a malicious action that triggers the vulnerable API calls. No specific privileged access is required. Knowledge of the application's API and data structure might be needed to craft a successful exploit."
