- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `usttrace` script in LTTng Userspace Tracer (UST) incorrectly modifies the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable by adding an empty directory path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure modification of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Adding an empty string to the colon-separated list of directories in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` causes `ld.so` to treat it as the current working directory (CWD).
    - This allows for the potential injection of malicious shared libraries if the script is executed from a directory where an attacker can write files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can gain elevated privileges by placing a malicious shared library in the current working directory. When `usttrace` is executed, it will load the attacker's library due to the vulnerability in how `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is handled.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs local access to the system.
    - The attacker needs to be able to write files to the directory where `usttrace` is executed.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when `usttrace` is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Local user on the system
    - Ability to write files to the current working directory where `usttrace` is executed.
