Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the Novell knowledge base article (KB 7006705), which aligns with CVE-2010-3264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Novell Identity Manager (IDM) installer logs credentials provided by the administrator to a log file during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credential Exposure:** The installer writes the administrator's credentials in plain text to the installation log file.
- **Insecure File Storage:** The log file `idmInstall.log` is stored in a publicly readable temporary directory (`/tmp`), making it accessible to other local users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Malicious local users or unauthorized parties can read the log file and gain access to the credentials of the eDirectory administrator.
- **Compromise of eDirectory:** The compromised credentials can be used to gain administrative access to the eDirectory, leading to the modification, deletion, or exfiltration of data within the eDirectory.
- **Lateral Movement:** In a network environment, this could potentially be leveraged to gain access to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the server where Novell IDM is installed. Any user with read access to the `/tmp` directory could potentially exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** An attacker needs to have a local account on the server where Novell Identity Manager was installed, and the ability to read the `/tmp` directory.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was resolved in IDM 4.01.
- The suggested mitigation is to manually delete the log file `/tmp/idmInstall.log` after installation of Identity Manager.
- The log file is only used for troubleshooting purposes during install and is not required after installation is complete.
