Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2010-3630:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content, specifically the SUSE security advisory and the Gentoo security advisory, directly mention CVE-2010-3630 as a vulnerability affecting `acroread` (Adobe Reader). This confirms the relevance of the content to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is related to vulnerabilities within Adobe Acrobat Reader that could be triggered by specially crafted PDF documents. These vulnerabilities could lead to memory corruption and other unintended behaviors.
*   The opensuse.org content states: "Specially crafted PDF documents could crash acroread or lead to execution of arbitrary code."

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Multiple vulnerabilities:** The advisory indicates several vulnerabilities are addressed by the update.
*   **Memory corruption:** The vulnerabilities stem from the way Adobe Reader handles specially crafted PDF documents, leading to potential memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crafted PDF could cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to write files or directories to the file system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted PDF files:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a malicious PDF document.
*   **Web browsers:** Since PDF files can be opened by browser plugins, browsing a malicious website hosting a booby-trapped PDF could also be an attack vector.
*   **Email attachments:** Malicious PDF files could also be delivered as email attachments.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file to the victim. This could be via a website, email, or other file sharing means.
*   **User interaction:** The user needs to open the crafted PDF file for the exploit to take effect. The user does not need to be logged in with special privileges, as the code executes with the rights of the user running the application.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerabilities affect Adobe Reader and Acrobat, including versions 9.3.4 and earlier, and versions 8.2.4 and earlier, across multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, UNIX).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Applying the security updates provided by Adobe is the primary solution.
    *   Disabling JavaScript within Adobe Reader and Acrobat can reduce the attack surface.
    *   Preventing browsers from automatically opening PDF files helps prevent drive-by download attacks.
    *   Caution should be used when opening PDF files from unknown sources.
*   **CVSS Score**: The SUSE advisory mentions a CVSS v2 Base Score of 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), which highlights the severe impact of this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2010-3630 is a vulnerability within Adobe Reader and Acrobat which involves the processing of crafted PDF files.  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unauthorized actions, due to multiple underlying weaknesses. The main attack vector is through specially crafted PDF documents that are opened by the user, highlighting the need for users to be cautious and for administrators to keep systems patched.
