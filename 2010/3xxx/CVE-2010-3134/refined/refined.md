{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "DLL Hijacking",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "The application loads 'quserex.dll' and 'wintab32.dll' from the same directory as a .kmz file, without proper path validation, leading to DLL hijacking."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on a local level.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by placing a malicious DLL (named quserex.dll) in the same directory as a .kmz file and executing the .kmz file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have write access to a location where a user will open a .kmz file, to place a malicious dll in that same location"
