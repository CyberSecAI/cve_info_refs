How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

From: Hanno Böck <hanno@...eck.de>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: mantis before 1.2.3 (XSS)

From release notes

"Issue #12312 covers an XSS vulnerability in the upstream NuSOAP library.
The fix has been applied to the library included in MantisBT releases,
and a patch has been submitted upstream for future releases of NuSOAP.
See <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12312> for further details.

Also included with 1.2.3 are another round of XSS fixes to MantisBT,
improved excel export, translation updates, and bug fixes to the SOAP
API, installation, plugin system, and email notifications."

So although it's both xss, one is in mantis itself and one in the
shipped/bundled nusoap, so we should have 2 CVEs.

I can fix that up in your patch when I commit it. |

# MantisBT 1.2.4 Released

Howdy all,

MantisBT 1.2.4 is a security update for the stable 1.2.x branch. All installations that are currently running any 1.2.x version are advised to upgrade to this release.

Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Lab reported multiple vulnerabilities in the admin/upgrade\_unattended.php script. Issue #12607 provides more detail on the vulnerabilities discovered. We thank Gjoko for his detailed assistance with testing, patching and answering questions. Please note that the /admin/ directory should be removed from all MantisBT installations after the installation or upgrade has been completed. This is particularly true for MantisBT installations accessible over the Internet.

Also included with 1.2.4 are some bug fixes relating to fonts in the MantisGraph plugin, SOAP API, CSV export, custom field values, relationship graphs, fields on the manage user page, built-in time tracking and the allow\_reporter\_close feature. This release includes updated translations for many languages and improved installation documentation in doc/INSTALL.

A full changelog for the 1.2.x series can be found on the official site:

<http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/changelog_page.php?version_id=112>

The release is available for download at:

<http://www.mantisbt.org/download.php>

Cheers

   Why don’t you provide the ability to upgrade using patch files instead of recommending a delete/replace procedure?

   It’s as simple as creating a patch file: `git diff release-1.2.3..release-1.2.4 > mantis-1.2.3-to-1.2.4.patch`, and providing this file available for download: <https://gist.github.com/741968>

   Forgot to mention: you can then update your Mantis installation through a simple command: `patch -p0 < mantis-1.2.3-to-1.2.4.patch`. Much handier.

   @Wim: I don’t believe that would work on a Windows installation without also installing GIT. And would make another piece of unrelated software required to patch, which would be a little difficult.

   Don’t get me wrong, i wish they would release an incremental update zip as well. For those cases where i have customizations in files that weren’t updated. In the current process i have to always check to make sure the customizations don’t get overwritten.

    Hi,

    I currenly have 1.1.2 version. I would like to upgrade 1.2.4 version but I have seen there’s lots of changes in the code as in the database structure. Is there any way to update my database for it to adapt to the new structure without lose information. Thanks for your help.

    @Styven Logout, backup code, attachments, database, and config, update code from latest version, go to the site and it will tell you on the login page that your schema is out of date, click and it will upgrade it for you.

    Vboctor, i already tryed all the upgrading steps from the managed module, it adds me the tables in the database that I need and I also adjust the data type of the fields that I need, but the tables and fields with no data leaves me with no data I’m always going to get errors query. I see that the dates camp there no longer datetime but int but when its upgrades doesn’t do the conversion, and also some problems with the category because now its handels on a separate table. If somebody had done a correct upgrade of a 1.1.x to an 1.2x version, i would be so thankful if you can help me. thanks for your information vboctor.

    @Mark Hosang: Any serious server environment has the patch command installed. Patch files, in combination with version control, are the only sane system to update software. Deleting old code + unzipping new code is archaic, error prone and not as easily reversible in case the update breaks something.
