  "CVE-2010-3275": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A dangling pointer vulnerability exists in VLC media player when handling .AMV files. By manipulating the 0x41st byte in the file format (video width/height), VLC crashes due to an invalid pointer, which allows remote attackers to gain arbitrary code execution.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by missing input sanitization when processing AMV files. Specifically, manipulating the video width/height byte at offset 0x41 causes a dangling pointer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Dangling pointer",
        "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a malformed AMV file",
        "Via a malicious web page embedding a crafted AMV file."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": [
          "User interaction to open the malformed file or browse a malicious web page.",
          "Ability to craft a malicious AMV file."
      ]
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "VLC 1.1.4",
      "VLC 1.1.5",
      "VLC 1.1.6",
      "VLC 1.1.7"
    ],
       "additional_information": "The exploit can be triggered remotely using a malicious web page that embeds a crafted AMV file. Metasploit module available to automate exploitation. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is addressed in VLC 1.1.8. The vulnerability is triggered by flipping the 0x41st byte in the file format (video width/height)."
