| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-56

## Dangling pointer vulnerability in nsTreeContentView

Announced
September 7, 2010
Reporter
regenrecht
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.12
* Firefox 3.6.9
* SeaMonkey 2.0.7
* Thunderbird 3.0.7
* Thunderbird 3.1.3

### Description

Security researcher **regenrecht** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that the implementation of XUL
<tree>'s content view contains a dangling pointer vulnerability.
One of the content view's methods for accessing the internal structure
of the tree could be manipulated into removing a node prior to
accessing it, resulting in the accessing of deleted memory. If an
attacker can control the contents of the deleted memory prior to its
access they could use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a
victim's machine.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.

firefox security update (RHSA-2010-0681)

Original Release Date: October 6, 2010

Last Revised: April 4, 2012

Number: ASA-2010-263

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-3169](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3169.html) and [CVE-2010-2762](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2762.html) to these issues.

Several use-after-free and dangling pointer flaws were found in Firefox. A
web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-2760](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2760.html), [CVE-2010-2766](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2766.html), [CVE-2010-2767](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2767.html), [CVE-2010-3167](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3167.html) and [CVE-2010-3168](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3168.html) to these issues.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Firefox. A web page containing
malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-2765](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2765.html) and [CVE-2010-3166](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3166.html) to these issues.

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in Firefox. A web page
containing malicious content could cause Firefox to run JavaScript code
with the permissions of a different website. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-2768](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2768.html) and [CVE-2010-2769](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2769.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XMLHttpRequest object. A remote site could
use this flaw to gather information about servers on an internal private
network. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-2764](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2764.html) to this issue.

Of the Avaya system products impacted by these vulnerabilities only Message
Networking and Message Storage Server have Firefox installed.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0681.html>

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-2760 CVE-2010-2763 CVE-2010-2765 CVE-2010-2766 CVE-2010-2767 CVE-2010-2768 CVE-2010-2769 CVE-2010-3167 CVE-2010-3168 CVE-2010-3169

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

- - Implementation errors in XUL processing allow the execution of
  arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2760, CVE-2010-3167, CVE-2010-3168)

- - An implementation error in the XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper wrapper allows
  the bypass of the same origin policy (CVE-2010-2763)

- - An integer overflow in frame handling allows the execution of
  arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2765)

- - An implementation error in DOM handling allows the execution of
  arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2766)

- - Incorrect pointer handling in the plugin code allow the execution of
  arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2767)

- - Incorrect handling of an object tag may lead to the bypass of cross
  site scripting filters (CVE-2010-2768)

- - Incorrect copy and paste handling could lead to cross site scripting
  (CVE-2010-2769)

- - Crashes in the layout engine may lead to the execution of arbitrary
  code (CVE-2010-3169)

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.19-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.12-1 of the iceweasel source package (which now builds the
xulrunner library binary packages).

For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.9-1 of the iceweasel source package (which now builds the
xulrunner library binary packages).

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

seamonkey security update (RHSA-2010-0680)

Original Release Date: September 10, 2010

Last Revised: September 10, 2010

Number: ASA-2010-241

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3169](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3169.html) to this issue.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in SeaMonkey. A web page containing
malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-2765](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2765.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw and several dangling pointer flaws were found in
SeaMonkey. A web page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-2760](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2760.html), [CVE-2010-2767](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2767.html), [CVE-2010-3167](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3167.html) and [CVE-2010-3168](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3168.html) to these issues.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in SeaMonkey. A web page
containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to run JavaScript code
with the permissions of a different website. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-2768](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-2768.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0680.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with seamonkey installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 2.0 including 2.0 SP1 and 2.0 SP2 | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

If you're not actually writing XUL code, this is probably not the right place for your bug.

Examples of appropriate bugs: Duplicate window ID causes infinite loop; or Scrollbars disappear after loading XUL document

ZDI-CAN-804: Mozilla Firefox nsTreeContentView Dangling Pointer Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- CVSS ----------------------------------------------------------------
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following
products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within the implementation of a particular
element within the XUL namespace. Due to a method for the element having
the side effect of executing javascript, an attacker can provide their
own javascript code which can be used to remove an object out from
underneath the element's child hierarchy. This can force the application
to make an invalid reference when traversing it's internal objects, thus
using an illegitimate pointer. This can be leveraged by an attacker to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the application.
Version(s) tested:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3)
Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3
One of the arguments to nsTreeContentView::GetCell is an nsITreeColumn
interface. This gives the function the side effect of being able to
execute a method of this object that is provided by the site. In this
code, the first point of the variable that can be controlled is located
within ChildIterator::Init.
layout/xul/base/src/tree/src/nsTreeContentView.cpp:1531
nsIContent\*
nsTreeContentView::GetCell(nsIContent\* aContainer, nsITreeColumn\* aCol)
{
nsCOMPtr<nsIAtom> colAtom;
PRInt32 colIndex;
aCol->GetAtom(getter\_AddRefs(colAtom));
aCol->GetIndex(&colIndex); // XXX
// Traverse through cells, try to find the cell by "ref" attribute or
by cell
// index in a row. "ref" attribute has higher priority.
nsIContent\* result = nsnull;
PRInt32 j = 0;
ChildIterator iter, last;
for (ChildIterator::Init(aContainer, &iter, &last); iter != last;
++iter) {
nsIContent\* cell = \*iter;
if (cell->Tag() == nsGkAtoms::treecell) {
if (colAtom && cell->AttrValueIs(kNameSpaceID\_None,
nsGkAtoms::ref,
colAtom, eCaseMatters)) {
result = cell;
break;
}
else if (j == colIndex) {
result = cell;
}
j++;
}
}
return result;
}
An example of a method that can be used to exploit the side effect in
the previously function can be located within ::GetCellValue. If an
attacker destroys the row when GetCell is called, then
ChildIterator::Init will access it as the unsafe type.
layout/xul/base/src/tree/src/nsTreeContentView.cpp:471
NS\_IMETHODIMP
nsTreeContentView::GetCellValue(PRInt32 aRow, nsITreeColumn\* aCol,
nsAString& \_retval)
{
\_retval.Truncate();
NS\_ENSURE\_ARG\_POINTER(aCol);
NS\_PRECONDITION(aRow >= 0 && aRow < PRInt32(mRows.Length()), "bad
row");
if (aRow < 0 || aRow >= PRInt32(mRows.Length()))
return NS\_ERROR\_INVALID\_ARG;
Row\* row = mRows[aRow];
nsIContent\* realRow =
nsTreeUtils::GetImmediateChild(row->mContent, nsGkAtoms::treerow);
if (realRow) {
nsIContent\* cell = GetCell(realRow, aCol); // XXX
if (cell)
cell->GetAttr(kNameSpaceID\_None, nsGkAtoms::value, \_retval);
}
return NS\_OK;
}
At this point, aContent has been destroyed.
layout/base/nsChildIterator.cpp:48
nsresult
ChildIterator::Init(nsIContent\* aContent,
ChildIterator\* aFirst,
ChildIterator\* aLast)
{
// Initialize out parameters to be equal, in case of failure.
aFirst->mContent = aLast->mContent = nsnull;
aFirst->mIndex = aLast->mIndex = 0;
NS\_PRECONDITION(aContent != nsnull, "no content");
if (! aContent)
return NS\_ERROR\_NULL\_POINTER;
nsIDocument\* doc = aContent->GetOwnerDoc();

We need to prevent content scripts (or maybe all scripts) from being able to provide their own implementation of nsITreeColumn. jst, can you remind me how to do that?

Why?
Looks like nsTreeContentView::GetCellValue needs to just use the normal
com-rules and keep the parameters it gives to GetCell alive.
(I haven't managed to reproduce this yet.)

Though, I agree, allowing only binary treecolumns would be better and safer.
We could add non-scriptable nsPITreeColumn interface and required
treecolumns to implement that.

We already have this, via GetColumnImpl. (Which is also a perf win.)

I decided to keep the method in nsTreeBodyFrame since that is where it is
really used. nsTreeContentView uses it just for nativeness check.

It would be neat if you could actually use the nsTreeColumn\* object (it's not clear that this macro creates a local variable), since we can then in theory call the non-xpcom methods such as GetAtom() [in a followup bug of course].

Whoa, how have we managed to go this long without a content-facing null check?

# Advisory Details

September 13th, 2010
## Mozilla Firefox nsTreeContentView Dangling Pointer Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-171ZDI-CAN-804

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3167) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [3.6.x](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9972']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the implementation of a particular element within the XUL namespace. Due to a method for the element having the side effect of executing javascript, an attacker can provide their own javascript code which can be used to remove an object out from underneath the element's child hierarchy. This can force the application to make an invalid reference when traversing it's internal objects, thus using an illegitimate pointer. This can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2010/mfsa2010-56.html> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-06-30 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-09-13 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.6.10, fixing various bugs
and security issues.
Mozilla Thunderbird was updated to version 3.0.8 on openSUSE, fixing
the same bugs.
Mozilla Seamonkey was updated to version 2.0.8 on openSUSE, fixing
the same bugs.
A Firefox update for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 3 is still
being worked on and currently held back due to legal problems with
the Firefox 3.5 - 3.6 version upgrade and some browser components.
Following security issues were fixed:
MFSA 2010-49 / CVE-2010-3169: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that
with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.
MFSA 2010-50 / CVE-2010-2765: Security researcher Chris Rohlf
of Matasano Security reported that the implementation of the HTML
frameset element contained an integer overflow vulnerability. The code
responsible for parsing the frameset columns used an 8-byte counter for
the column numbers, so when a very large number of columns was passed
in the counter would overflow. When this counter was subsequently
used to allocate memory for the frameset, the memory buffer would
be too small, potentially resulting in a heap buffer overflow and
execution of attacker-controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-51 / CVE-2010-2767: Security researcher Sergey Glazunov
reported a dangling pointer vulnerability in the implementation
of navigator.plugins in which the navigator object could retain a
pointer to the plugins array even after it had been destroyed. An
attacker could potentially use this issue to crash the browser and
run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-52 / CVE-2010-3131: Security researcher Haifei Li of
FortiGuard Labs reported that Firefox could be used to load a malicious
code library that had been planted on a victim's computer. Firefox
attempts to load dwmapi.dll upon startup as part of its platform
detection, so on systems that don't have this library, such as Windows
XP, Firefox will subsequently attempt to load the library from the
current working directory. An attacker could use this vulnerability
to trick a user into downloading a HTML file and a malicious copy
of dwmapi.dll into the same directory on their computer and opening
the HTML file with Firefox, thus causing the malicious code to be
executed. If the attacker was on the same network as the victim,
the malicious DLL could also be loaded via a UNC path. The attack
also requires that Firefox not currently be running when it is asked
to open the HTML file and accompanying DLL.
As this is a Windows only problem, it does not affect the Linux
version. It is listed for completeness only.
MFSA 2010-53 / CVE-2010-3166: Security researcher wushi of team509
reported a heap buffer overflow in code routines responsible
for transforming text runs. A page could be constructed with a
bidirectional text run which upon reflow could result in an incorrect
length being calculated for the run of text. When this value is
subsequently used to allocate memory for the text too small a buffer
may be created potentially resulting in a buffer overflow and the
execution of attacker controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-54 / CVE-2010-2760: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that there was a remaining
dangling pointer issue leftover from the fix to CVE-2010-2753. Under
certain circumstances one of the pointers held by a XUL tree selection
could be freed and then later reused, potentially resulting in the
execution of attacker-controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-55 / CVE-2010-3168: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that XUL <tree> objects could be
manipulated such that the setting of certain properties on the object
would trigger the removal of the tree from the DOM and cause certain
sections of deleted memory to be accessed. In products based on Gecko
version 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6, Thunderbird 3.1) and newer this memory has
been overwritten by a value that will cause an unexploitable crash. In
products based on Gecko version 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5, Thunderbird 3.0,
and SeaMonkey 2.0) and older an attacker could potentially use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on
their computer.
MFSA 2010-56 / CVE-2010-3167: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that the implementation of XUL
<tree>'s content view contains a dangling pointer vulnerability. One
of the content view's methods for accessing the internal structure of
the tree could be manipulated into removing a node prior to accessing
it, resulting in the accessing of deleted memory. If an attacker can
control the contents of the deleted memory prior to its access they
could use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code on a victim's
machine.
MFSA 2010-57 / CVE-2010-2766: Security researcher regenrecht reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that code used to normalize
a document contained a logical flaw that could be leveraged to run
arbitrary code. When the normalization code ran, a static count of
the document's child nodes was used in the traversal, so a page could
be constructed that would remove DOM nodes during this normalization
which could lead to the accessing of a deleted object and potentially
the execution of attacker-controlled memory.
MFSA 2010-58 / CVE-2010-2770: Security researcher Marc Schoenefeld
reported that a specially crafted font could be applied to a document
and cause a crash on Mac systems. The crash showed signs of memory
corruption and presumably could be used by an attacker to execute
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
This issue probably does not affect the Linux builds and so is listed
for completeness.
MFSA 2010-59 / CVE-2010-2762: Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported
that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW), a security
wrapper that allows content-defined objects to be safely accessed by
privileged code, creates scope chains ending in outer objects. Users
of SJOWs which expect the scope chain to end on an inner object may
be handed a chrome privileged object which could be leveraged to run
arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.
Michal Zalewski's recent contributions helped to identify this
architectural weakness.
MFSA 2010-60 / CVE-2010-2763: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the wrapper class XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) on
the Mozilla 1.9.1 development branch has a logical error in its
scripted function implementation that allows the caller to run the
function within the context of another site. This is a violation of
the same-origin policy and could be used to mount an XSS attack.
MFSA 2010-61 / CVE-2010-2768: Security researchers David Huang and
Collin Jackson of Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Silicon Valley
campus) reported that the type attribute of an <object> tag can
override the charset of a framed HTML document, even when the document
is included across origins. A page could be constructed containing
such an <object> tag which sets the charset of the framed document
to UTF-7. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject UTF-7
encoded JavaScript into a site, bypassing the site's XSS filters,
and then executing the code using the above technique.
MFSA 2010-62 / CVE-2010-2769: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that when an HTML selection containing JavaScript is copy-and-pasted
or dropped onto a document with designMode enabled the JavaScript
will be executed within the context of the site where the code was
dropped. A malicious site could leverage this issue in an XSS attack
by persuading a user into taking such an action and in the process
running malicious JavaScript within the context of another site.
MFSA 2010-63 / CVE-2010-2764: Matt Haggard reported that the
statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object is readable by the
requestor even when the request is made across origins. This status
information reveals the presence of a web server and could be used
to gather information about servers on internal private networks.
This issue was also independently reported to Mozilla by Nicholas
Berthaume
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart all running Mozilla instances after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.
