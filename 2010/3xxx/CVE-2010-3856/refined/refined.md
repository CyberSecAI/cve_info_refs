Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3856:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents confirm that the content relates to CVE-2010-3856, which is described as a vulnerability in the GNU C Library's dynamic linker (`ld.so`) related to the handling of the `LD_AUDIT` environment variable. Specifically, the vulnerability allows loading of arbitrary Dynamic Shared Objects (DSOs).

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The GNU C library dynamic linker (`ld.so`) does not sufficiently restrict the use of the `LD_AUDIT` environment variable. This variable is intended to specify libraries for auditing dynamic linking, but it can be abused to load arbitrary DSOs.
    *   Specifically, when a setuid or setgid program is executed, the dynamic loader allows loading of libraries specified by `LD_AUDIT` even if they are not explicitly designated as safe to be loaded across privilege boundaries. This contrasts with how `LD_PRELOAD` is handled for setuid/setgid programs.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unrestricted DSO Loading:** The dynamic linker loads DSOs specified via `LD_AUDIT` without proper checks, including whether these libraries are designed to operate safely with different effective and real UIDs/GIDs.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code, because the `dlopen()` call used to load the audit library also runs the DSO's initialization routines (.ctors), even if the library doesn't export the needed symbols of the rtld-auditing API.
    *   **Bypassing Preload Restrictions:** The dynamic loader ignores requests to preload user-specified libraries (`LD_PRELOAD`) for setuid/setgid programs, but this restriction does not apply to `LD_AUDIT`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can use this flaw to execute code with root privileges by leveraging a malicious DSO located in the trusted library search paths. The vulnerable programs are setuid and setgid.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Arbitrary code can be executed as a privileged user due to the exploitation of initialization routines in libraries loaded through `LD_AUDIT`.
    *   **File/Directory Creation:** Some libraries with unsafe constructors will create files and directories as root when loaded via `LD_AUDIT`, and these files can be used to gain a privileged shell using a cronjob setup or other means.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is via the `LD_AUDIT` environment variable, which is not properly sanitized when running a setuid/setgid binary.
    *   A malicious DSO must exist in the trusted library search path (typically `/lib`, `/usr/lib` but can be extended via `/etc/ld.so.conf`).
    *   The DSO must have initialization code that performs unsafe actions while having elevated privileges. This can be achieved through constructors or other init routines.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system, and must be able to execute a setuid or setgid program.
    *   **Environment Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to set the `LD_AUDIT` and other environment variables (`PCPROFILE_OUTPUT`, `LFTP_HOME`, etc.) in order to point to a malicious DSO that will perform the unwanted actions.

**3. Additional Technical Details (from seclists.org content):**

*   **Example Exploitation Steps (Ubuntu 10.04):**
    *   Setting the umask to `0` to influence file creation permissions.
    *   Using `LD_AUDIT` to load a vulnerable shared library (e.g., `libpcprofile.so`).
    *   Utilizing the DSO constructor to create a world-writable file in `/etc/cron.d/` by specifying the file name using `PCPROFILE_OUTPUT`.
    *   Setting up a cron job in the newly created file that will execute code as root.
*   **Alternative Exploitation using `liblftp-tasks.so.0`:**
    *   Using `LD_AUDIT` to load `liblftp-tasks.so.0`.
    *   Setting `LFTP_HOME` to an arbitrary directory, which will be created as root by the constructors in this library.
*   **Identifying Candidate Libraries:**
    *   DSOs with declared constructors or other initialization code are potential targets
    *   The .ctors section of a library can be examined to verify if constructors have been declared
    *   Using tools like `objdump` to check for `.ctors` sections.
    *   Using gdb to determine the difference between `__CTOR_LIST__` and `__CTOR_END__`

**4. Affected Software:**

*   The vulnerability affects GNU C library versions prior to 2.11.3, and 2.12.x before 2.12.2.
*   Specifically tested versions include:
    *   2.12.1 (FC13)
    *   2.5 (RHEL5 / CentOS5)
    *   2.11.1 (Ubuntu 10)

**5. Fix Information:**
*   Updated `glibc` packages that incorporate patches to fix the vulnerability are released by major distributions.
*   Specific package versions and update instructions for different Ubuntu releases are available within the Ubuntu Security Notice.
*   Red Hat released updated glibc packages (RHSA-2010:0793).
*   SUSE provided updated glibc packages for various affected releases.
*   VMware also released updated Service Console packages to address the glibc issue.

**6. Exploit:**

The `exploit-db.com` content provides a Metasploit module to exploit this vulnerability using the `libpcprofile.so`. It outlines steps to create a shared object and a script to:
* Leverage LD_AUDIT to create the malicious DSO in a trusted path,
* Overwrite the DSO with shellcode, then,
* Load the shellcode via LD_AUDIT in the setuid program to gain root privileges.

**7. Additional Notes**

* Some content suggests that end users do not need to be concerned, but this is in reference to non-privileged users. Security professionals and system administrators should be concerned.
* The vulnerability is rated as 'important' by Red Hat.

In summary, CVE-2010-3856 is a significant local privilege escalation vulnerability that arises from the dynamic linker's insufficient restrictions on the `LD_AUDIT` variable. Attackers can use this variable to load arbitrary code as a privileged user by exploiting the initialization routines of DSOs in trusted library paths. This vulnerability is resolved by updating to patched `glibc` packages.
