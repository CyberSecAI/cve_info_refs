  "cveId": "CVE-2010-3837",
  "description": "It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled using GROUP_CONCAT() and WITH ROLLUP together. An authenticated user could crash the server.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to how MySQL handles the `GROUP_CONCAT()` function in conjunction with the `WITH ROLLUP` modifier within prepared statements. When a `GROUP_CONCAT()` expression with `ORDER BY` is used in a query with `WITH ROLLUP`, a copy of the `Item_func_group_concat` object is made. The ORDER objects within this copy are modified to point to memory local to the cloned object. When this local memory is freed after query execution, the pointers in the original object become invalid. Subsequent executions of the prepared statement trigger a crash by dereferencing these dangling pointers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory management during cloning of objects related to `GROUP_CONCAT` and `WITH ROLLUP`",
      "Use of shared pointers to memory that has different lifecycle"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (mysqld daemon crash)",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Remote authenticated users can trigger this vulnerability through a crafted SQL query within a prepared statement."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker must have valid credentials to connect and execute queries against the MySQL server."
