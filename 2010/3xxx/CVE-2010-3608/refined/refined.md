Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass in the wpQuiz 2.7 application. The provided exploit shows that by injecting SQL into the login form, a user can bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection by allowing the input of `' or '1=1` as the username and password. This results in a query that always evaluates to true.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability results in a complete authentication bypass, allowing unauthorized access to the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker full access to the application's admin or user panel. This can lead to complete control over the application.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete data within the application's database.
- **Malicious Actions:**  After gaining access, attackers can modify application content, upload malicious files or take other actions on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the login form of the wpQuiz application via the web interface.
- **SQL Injection via login form:** Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by injecting SQL code into the username and password fields of the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable wpQuiz application.
- **Basic knowledge:** The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit shows that the SQL injection can be triggered by injecting `' or '1=1` into the ID (username) and PW (password) fields. This input bypasses the application's authentication logic by always evaluating the SQL query to TRUE.
- The vulnerable application is wpQuiz version 2.7.
- The exploit suggests that both admin.php and user.php are vulnerable endpoints.
