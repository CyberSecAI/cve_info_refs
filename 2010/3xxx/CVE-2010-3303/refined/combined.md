How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Summary | 0012232: Multiple XSS issues with custom field enumeration values | | | | |
| Description | MantisBT administrators (who can configure custom fields) can place malicious Javascript within the options they define for custom field enumeration/checkbox/radio/etc field types. These HTML-unsafe options are then printed to users throughout MantisBT (report, update, view, etc) without sanitisation.  This is low risk due to the need to be a MantisBT administrator to configure custom field values. Rather than being a pure security risk, this is more a case of allowing more characters to be used safely within custom field options. | | | | |

I'm assigning one ID to all four of these. If someone thinks they should be
split, let me know.

Use CVE-2010-3303

| Package | **www-apps/mantisbt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.11** |

### Background

MantisBT is a PHP/MySQL/Web based bugtracking system.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MantisBT. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to conduct
directory traversal attacks, disclose the contents of local files, inject
arbitrary web scripts, obtain sensitive information, bypass
authentication and intended access restrictions, or manipulate bugs and
attachments.

### Workaround

Message-Id: <201009142306.07888.hanno@hboeck.de>
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 2010 23:06:07 +0200
From: Hanno Böck <hanno@...eck.de>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: mantis before 1.2.3 (XSS)

From release notes

"Issue #12312 covers an XSS vulnerability in the upstream NuSOAP library.
The fix has been applied to the library included in MantisBT releases,
and a patch has been submitted upstream for future releases of NuSOAP.
See <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12312> for further details.

Also included with 1.2.3 are another round of XSS fixes to MantisBT,
improved excel export, translation updates, and bug fixes to the SOAP
API, installation, plugin system, and email notifications."

So although it's both xss, one is in mantis itself and one in the
shipped/bundled nusoap, so we should have 2 CVEs.
