See the "ACL handling bugs" message for more details about the ACL
merging bug.

	* acl: Fixed the logic of merging multiple ACL entries. Now it works as
	  documented, while previously it could have done slightly different
	  things depending on the order of the entries.
	* virtual: Allow opening virtual mailboxes that refer to non-existing
	  mailboxes. It seems that the benefits of this outweigh the lack of
	  error message when typoing a mailbox name.

	+ Added some disk I/O optimizations to Maildir and index code. They're
	  especially helpful with short-lived connections like POP3.
	+ pop3: Added pop3_fast_size_lookups setting.
	- doveconf sometimes failed with complaining about missing ssl_key
	  setting, causing e.g. dovecot-lda to fail.
	- lda: If there's an error in configuration, doveconf didn't exit with
	  EX_TEMPFAIL as it should have.
	- sdbox: Fixed memory leak when copying messages with hard links.
	- zlib + sdbox combination didn't work
	- zlib: Fixed several crashes, which mainly showed up with mbox.
	- quota: Don't crash if user has quota disabled, but plugin loaded.
	- doveadm fetch uid was actually returning sequence, not uid.
	- v2.0.4's subscription listing ignored (and logged a warning about)
	  subscriptions=no namespaces' entries in some configurations.
	  (So listing shared mailboxes' subscriptions could have been broken.)
	- acl: Fixed crashing when sometimes listing shared mailboxes via
	  dict proxy.

See the "ACL handling bugs" message for more details about the ACL
merging bug.

	* acl: Fixed the logic of merging multiple ACL entries. Now it works as
	  documented, while previously it could have done slightly different
	  things depending on the order of the entries.

	* acl: Don't give admin rights to all owner mailboxes. This was
	  originally done to make sure that mailbox owner couldn't accidentally
	  remove their own admin rights. But this is already prevented by
	  SETACL command, so it's not necessary. Also sysadmin may have
	  intentionally removed some admin rights from some mailboxes
	  (especially when using symlinked shared mailboxes).

	- Maildir: Fixed potential "Duplicate file entry" in dovecot-uidlist
	  file errors.
	- Maildir: Avoid unnecessary uidlist recreation during mail delivery.
	- imap: When SELECT fails, it didn't close the previous mailbox.
	- Dovecot master process could have died if it got SIGCHLD signals
	  very rapidly while it was trying to log. This could have happened
	  for example if a lot of imap/pop3 sessions disconnected at the exact
	  same time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- NetworkManager
dbus-glib allowed local users to write properties that were exported
read-only via dbus (CVE-2010-1172).
Affected Products: SLE11
- bind
A DoS vulnerability in bind's DNSSEC code has been
fixed which occured while recursively validating a server.
CVE-2010-0213 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- clamav
clamav version 0.96.3 fixes problems when scanning pdf files
(CVE-2010-3434) and also contains numerous other bug fixes.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- dovecot12
dovecot granted admin rights to all owner mailboxes (CVE-2010-3706).
When using multiple ACL entries for mailboxes the most specific one
was not always applied (CVE-2010-3707).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- festival
festival\_server uses an unsafe LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. Local users could exploit
that to execute code as another user if that user runs festival\_server.
CVE-2010-3996 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- gpg2
GnuPG2 was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by context-dependent
attackers because of reusing a freed pointer when verifying a signature
or importing a certificate with many "Subject Alternate Names".
(CVE-2010-2547)
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.0
- libfreebl3
The Mozilla NSS Library was updated to version 3.12.8 and the Mozilla
NSPR Library was updated to 4.8.6 to fix various bugs and one security
issue.
CVE-2010-3170: Disallow wildcard matching in X509 certificate Common
Names.
This update also has preparations for Firefox 4 support, and a updated
Root Certificate Authority list.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- php5-pear-mail
Passing specially crafted $from and $recepient arguments to
php5-pear-mail's sendmail.php allowed attackers to inject shell
code (CVE-2009-4023, CVE-2009-4111).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- postgresql
PostgreSQL functions implemented in Perl or TCL shared a global state
even across different user user ids. A user could therefore influence
functions of other users in an unexpected or even malicious way
(CVE-2010-3433).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# USN-1059-1: Dovecot vulnerabilities

7 February 2011

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [dovecot](/security/cves?package=dovecot) -

## Details

It was discovered that the ACL plugin in Dovecot would incorrectly

propagate ACLs to new mailboxes. A remote authenticated user could possibly

read new mailboxes that were created with the wrong ACL. ([CVE-2010-3304](/security/CVE-2010-3304))

It was discovered that the ACL plugin in Dovecot would incorrectly merge

ACLs in certain circumstances. A remote authenticated user could possibly

bypass intended access restrictions and gain access to mailboxes.

([CVE-2010-3706](/security/CVE-2010-3706), [CVE-2010-3707](/security/CVE-2010-3707))

It was discovered that the ACL plugin in Dovecot would incorrectly grant

the admin permission to owners of certain mailboxes. A remote authenticated

user could possibly bypass intended access restrictions and gain access to

mailboxes. ([CVE-2010-3779](/security/CVE-2010-3779))

It was discovered that Dovecot incorrecly handled the simultaneous

disconnect of a large number of sessions. A remote authenticated user could

use this flaw to cause Dovecot to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2010-3780](/security/CVE-2010-3780))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [dovecot-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot)
  -
  [1:1.2.12-1ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot/1%3A1.2.12-1ubuntu8.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [dovecot-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot)
  -
  [1:1.2.9-1ubuntu6.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot/1%3A1.2.9-1ubuntu6.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
I thought I'd write one mail about this, rather than duplicate the whole
thing to both v1.2.15 and v2.0.5 release announcements.

So, ever since this commit:

2009-11-10  Timo Sirainen  <[tss at iki.fi](http://dovecot.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/dovecot)>

	* src/plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c:
	acl: Merge group rights if user belongs to more than one.
	[76ff6831c9ae]

The ACLs were being merged, rather than fully replaced, a bit too often.
Since this is about merging, the problem could have happened only when
using more than one entry in the ACL file. The main problems created by
this were:

a) If admin wanted to remove some rights from mailboxes in user's
private namespace (e.g. symlinked shared mailboxes), they may not have
gotten removed.

b) When mixing up multiple ACL entries, such as groups/users the more
specific entry may not have replaced the previous entry (e.g.
group-override may not have worked as expected).

The bug happened when two or more ACL entries of same "type" existed.
The first entry was handled correctly, but the next ones may have only
been adding ACLs rather than replacing them. For example if you had the
following ACL file:

group=people lrwi
user=foo lr
user=bar lr

So basically everyone in "people" group should have "lrwi" rights, but
foo and bar users should have only "lr" rights. If foo and bar didn't
belong to people group, everything would work as expected. If they did,
then what would happen is:

 * foo would work correctly, because it was the first entry of user
type.
 * bar would keep "lrwi" rights, because the previous entry (user=foo)
was of the same type (both are "user" type), so Dovecot decided to add
the rights on top of group=people entry rather than replace them.

BTW. The other ACL bug/"feature" of automatically adding admin rights
that was fixed in v1.2.15 was already fixed in v2.0.beta2.

```
