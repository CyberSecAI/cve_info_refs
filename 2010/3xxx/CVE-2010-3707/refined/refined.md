{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ACL merging logic in Dovecot incorrectly merged multiple ACL entries of the same type, leading to incorrect permissions being applied.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect ACL merging",
    "Bypassing intended access restrictions"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote authenticated user could bypass intended access restrictions and gain access to mailboxes by exploiting the incorrect ACL merging logic. This could lead to unauthorized access to private or shared mailboxes.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote, authenticated user who has access to the mail server and the ability to manipulate ACL entries.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with access to the Dovecot mail server, and the ability to manipulate ACL entries. The attacker must also belong to a group with different rights than the targeted user, or if it targets a user it must be listed after another user in the ACL file."
