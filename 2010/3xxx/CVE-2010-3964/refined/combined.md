# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Malformed Request Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3964

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Document Conversions Launcher Service validates SOAP requests before processing on a SharePoint server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on an affected SharePoint server under the security context of a guest account.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-3964](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3964).

#### Mitigating Factors for Malformed Request Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3964

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, the Document Conversions Load Balancer Service and Document Conversions Launcher Service are not enabled in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code as a guest account that only has rights to a specific temporary directory. The content of this specific temporary directory is cleaned up regularly.

#### Workarounds for Malformed Request Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3964

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Stop and Disable Office Document Conversions Launcher Service**

  Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator on each system running the Document Conversions Launcher Service:

  `sc stop dclauncher`

  `sc config dclauncher start= disabled`

  **Impact of Workaround.** Office document conversion is disabled.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:

  `sc config dclauncher start= auto`

  `sc start dclauncher`
* **Block ports used by the Office Document Conversions Launcher Service at the firewall**

  Block the following port at the firewall:

  TCP Port 8082

  This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking this port at the enterprise firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of Workaround.** Applications and services may use the affected port. Blocking connectivity to the port may cause various applications or services to not function.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Unblock TCP port 8082 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for Malformed Request Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3964

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of a guest account on the affected SharePoint server.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the Document Conversions Launcher Service does not properly validate specially crafted Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) requests.

**What is Document Conversions Launcher Service?**

Document Conversions Launcher Service schedules and initiates the document conversions on a server. When Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 passes a document conversion request to the service, the Document Conversions Launcher Service calls the appropriate document converter. In most server farm configurations, the Document Conversions Launcher Service and the converter programs that it starts should be installed on an application server. Each application server can only have a single Document Conversions Launcher Service enabled.

Document Conversions Launcher Service runs under the HVU\_*ComputerName* account. The HVU\_*ComputerName* account is a local guest account created on the application server when the Document Conversions Launcher Service is enabled.

**What is Document Conversions Load Balancer Service?**

Document Conversions Load Balancer Service balances document conversion requests. The Document Conversions Load Balancer Service can be configured on a stand-alone server or on one server in a farm. When it receives a converter request from Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, the Document Conversions Load Balancer Service returns a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) pointing to the appropriate Document Conversions Launcher Service. SharePoint Server 2007 connects to the specified launcher via SOAP requests and requests that it convert the specified document.

Note that disabling the Document Conversions Load Balancer Service stops the document conversion process and also disables the Document Conversions Launcher Service.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of a guest user on the target server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker can send a specially crafted SOAP request to the Document Conversions Launcher Service in a SharePoint server environment that is using the Document Conversions Load Balancer Service. When the Document Conversions Launcher Service processes the specially crafted SOAP request, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution in the security context of a guest account on the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

SharePoint server environments that use the Document Conversions Load Balancer Service are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution on servers running the Document Conversions Launcher Service in the SharePoint server environment.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Document Conversion Launcher Service validates specially crafted SOAP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

* [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** or **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
