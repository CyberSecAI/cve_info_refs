  "CVE-2010-3858": {
    "description": "The CONFIG_STACK_GROWSDOWN variant of setup_arg_pages() does not check the size of the argument/environment area on the stack. When it is unworkably large, shift_arg_pages() hits its BUG_ON. This is exploitable with a very large RLIMIT_STACK limit, to create a crash pretty easily.",
    "root_cause": "The `setup_arg_pages()` function in the Linux kernel, when compiled with `CONFIG_STACK_GROWSDOWN`, lacks proper size checking for the argument and environment data placed on the stack during process creation. This oversight allows an attacker to specify an excessively large size for this data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Missing size check in `setup_arg_pages()` for argument/environment data.",
      "Potential for stack overflow due to unbounded data size.",
       "Reliance on `shift_arg_pages()` to catch the error, rather than preventing it earlier."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can trigger a kernel crash (denial of service) by providing excessively large arguments/environment when launching a new process, which leads to a `BUG_ON` in the kernel's `shift_arg_pages()` function.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local execution of a specially crafted program.",
      "Manipulating process creation with excessively large arguments and environment variables."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute code locally on the vulnerable system. They do not require any special privileges, however a large stack size needs to be available. The vulnerability is exposed through the `execv` syscall.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the kernel's stack growth check is bypassed, leading to a crash when the stack expands beyond its limits. The issue is specific to systems where the stack grows downwards (`CONFIG_STACK_GROWSDOWN`)."
