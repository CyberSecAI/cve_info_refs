How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- gdm
This update provides the following fixes:
- 633655: Change the way dbus properties are exported to avoid write
access to read-only properties.
- 627893: Upon relogin gdm displays the Windows domain, but tries to
authenticate locally
- 490621: Windows domain not remembered from previous log-in
- 583060: Optionally allow to configure to prohibit end user to use
"root" id at gdm login
- 506917: Fix window login getting a huge horizontal size
- 627893: Fix that upon relogin gdm displays the Windows domain, but
tries to authenticate locally.
In addition this update was rebuilt against the latest dbus-glib bindings
to avoid that local users can write properties that were exported read-
only via dbus (CVE-2010-1172).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- openssl/libopenssl-devel
Multithreaded OpenSSL servers using the TLS server
extension are vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack. CVE-2010-3864
has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- poppler/libpoppler4/libpoppler-devel
Specially crafted PDF files could crash poppler or potentially even
cause execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2010-3702, CVE-2010-3704)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- quagga
This update of quagga fixes two security issues:
- CVE-2010-2948: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Stack-based buffer overflow while processing malformed Route-Refresh
messages.
- CVE-2010-2949: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Denial of service while processing malformed BGP update AS path
messages
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.

Jose, This is still work is progress and there may be a few more changes to the final patch, Also we are trying to fix multiple issues in here.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- clamav
clamav was updated to version 0.96.5 to fix denial of service
problems (CVE-2010-4479, CVE-2010-4260, CVE-2010-4261)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- subversion
The SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit option allowed remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2010-3315).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- python
a race condition in the accept() implementation of smtpd.py could
lead to a denial of service (CVE-2010-3493).
integer overflows and insufficient size checks could crash the
audioop module (CVE-2010-2089, CVE-2010-1634).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit that to
modify or forge messages (CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020,
CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS version 2.4.9 fixes among other things two cross-site-scripting
and a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2010-2080, CVE-2010-3476,
CVE-2010-4071).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moonlight
Untrusted Moonlight apps could bypass constraints on methods which
potentially allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-4254).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.3
- OpenOffice\_org
Specially crafted ppt files could cause a heap based buffer overflow
in OpenOffice\_org Impress. Attackers could exploit that to crash
OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936).
The update also fixes numerous non-security bugs. Please refer to

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml documents could crash applications linked
against libxml2 (CVE-2010-4008).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- tomboy
The tomboy startup scripts put empty elements in LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
causing tomboy to load shared libraries from the current directory
(CVE-2010-4005).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit
that to modify or forge messages
(CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020, CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- php5
Insufficient handling of certain character sequences in the
utf8\_decode() function could be leveraged to conduct
cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2010-3870).
php5 could also consume large amounts of memory and crash if a long
mail address was passed to filter\_var() with parmeter
FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL (CVE-2010-3710).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- cups
- CVE-2010-3702: Specially crafted PDF files could crash pdftops or
potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code.
- CVE-2010-2941: Specially crafted IPP requests could crash cupsd
- CVE-2010-0542: A NULL pointer dereference in the \_WriteProlog()
function of the texttops image filter.
- CVE-2010-1748: An attacker with access to the web-interface may be
able to read some bytes of uninitialized memory.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Untrusted applets could read values of restricted system properties
(CVE-2010-3860).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- epiphany
Epiphany does not support verification of ssl certificates. It
nevertheless displayed all https connections as secure
(CVE-2010-3312).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2
- encfs
- CVE-2010-3073: encfs only used 32bits for the IV
- CVE-2010-3074: encfs was prone to a watermarking attack
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Upstream came up with the identical fix to my proposal based on what seems to be an independent report from Joel Voss:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=e853106b58d6b4b0467dbd6436c9bb1cfbd372cf>  <http://secunia.com/advisories/41596/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=595245#c7)  Huzaifa S.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2135-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
December 21, 2010                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : xpdf
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-3702 CVE-2010-3704

Joel Voss of Leviathan Security Group discovered two vulnerabilities
in xpdf rendering engine, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code if a malformed PDF file is opened.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.02-1.4+lenny3.

For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems don't apply, since xpdf has been
patched to use the Poppler PDF library.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## Topic

Updated tetex packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

teTeX is an implementation of TeX. TeX takes a text file and a set of
formatting commands as input, and creates a typesetter-independent DeVice
Independent (DVI) file as output.

teTeX embeds a copy of t1lib to rasterize bitmaps from PostScript Type 1
fonts. The following issues affect t1lib code:

Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way t1lib processed
Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files. If a specially-crafted font file was opened
by teTeX, it could cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2010-2642,
CVE-2011-0433)

An invalid pointer dereference flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running teTeX.
(CVE-2011-0764)

A use-after-free flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file
could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1553)

An off-by-one flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted font file could,
when opened, cause teTeX to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running teTeX. (CVE-2011-1554)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in t1lib. A specially-crafted
font file could, when opened, cause teTeX to crash. (CVE-2011-1552)

teTeX embeds a copy of Xpdf, an open source Portable Document Format (PDF)
file viewer, to allow adding images in PDF format to the generated PDF
documents. The following issues affect Xpdf code:

An uninitialized pointer use flaw was discovered in Xpdf. If pdflatex was
used to process a TeX document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it
could cause pdflatex to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3702)

An array index error was found in the way Xpdf parsed PostScript Type 1
fonts embedded in PDF documents. If pdflatex was used to process a TeX
document referencing a specially-crafted PDF file, it could cause pdflatex
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running pdflatex. (CVE-2010-3704)

Red Hat would like to thank the Evince development team for reporting
CVE-2010-2642. Upstream acknowledges Jon Larimer of IBM X-Force as the
original reporter of CVE-2010-2642.

All users of tetex are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=595245#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-05-24 07:59:07 UTC  ``` Sauli Pahlman of CERT-FI provided us with fuzzed PDF file which causes xpdf / poppler PDF parser to crash.  The crash is caused by an attempt to dereference uninitialized Gfx::parser pointer in Gfx::getPos(), which assumes parser is either NULL or valid Parser pointer.  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/poppler/Gfx.cc?id=71063d51#n879>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=595245#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2010-05-24 08:01:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 416048](attachment.cgi?id=416048&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=416048&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  This makes sure that parser in initialized to NULL in Gfx constructors.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=595245#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-30 06:30:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=595245#c2)) > Created [attachment 416048](attachment.cgi?id=416048&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=416048&action=edit "Proposed patch") > Proposed patch >  > This makes sure that parser in initialized to NULL in Gfx constructors.  Upstream came up with the identical fix to my proposal based on what seems to be an independent report from Joel Voss:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=e853106b58d6b4b0467dbd6436c9bb1cfbd372cf>  <http://secunia.com/advisories/41596/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=595245#c7)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-30 13:52:36 UTC  ``` An array indexing error was found in the way xpdf / poppler parsed Type1 fonts embedded in PDF documents.  In FoFiType1::parse(), text representation of the numeric code value was converted to integer value using atoi().  This value was checked to ensure it's less than 256, but there was no check to ensure it's not negative (string passed to atoi() was checked to only contain characters '0'-'9' before the call though).  On platforms, where atoi() could return negative result when parsing large positive values (exceeding INT_MAX), this could could lead to write out of array bounds due to use of negative index.  poppler upstream commit: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=39d140bfc0b8239bdd96d6a55842034ae5c05473>  Reference: <http://secunia.com/advisories/41596/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2010-09-30 14:00:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c0)) > On platforms, where atoi() could return negative result when parsing large > positive values (exceeding INT_MAX), this could could lead to write out of > array bounds due to use of negative index.  This does happen on e.g. x86_64, but does not happen on i386.  Affected code is present in xpdf versions 3.00 and later, it is not part of xpdf 2.x (so EL3 is not affected, EL4 tetex is not affected).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c4)  Huzaifa S.

Official xpdf patch may appear later this week.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-07 15:05:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0749 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0749.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-07 15:26:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0751 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0751.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-07 15:31:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0752 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0752.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-10-07 15:52:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0753 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0753.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2010-10-25 08:13:09 UTC  ``` xpdf upstream fixed this via xpdf-3.02pl5.patch, see [bug #595245, comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=595245#c22 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3702 xpdf: uninitialized Gfx::parser pointer dereference").   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-10 19:17:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2010:0859 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0859.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=638960#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-23 14:58:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1201 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1201.html>   ``` |  |
