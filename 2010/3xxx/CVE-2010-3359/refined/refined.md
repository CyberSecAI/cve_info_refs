  "cveId": "CVE-2010-3359",
  "description": "If LD_LIBRARY_PATH is undefined in gargoyle-free before 2009-08-25, the variable will point to the current directory. This can allow a local user to trick another user into running gargoyle in a directory with a cracked libgarglk.so and gain access to the user's account.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that if the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable is not explicitly set, the dynamic linker will default to searching the current directory for shared libraries. The `gargoyle-free` application does not properly sanitize or control this behavior.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled search path element",
       "Insecure default environment variable usage"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to another user's account. By placing a malicious shared library (libgarglk.so) in a directory, they can force a user to execute `gargoyle` within that directory, which will then load the attacker's library.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access to the system is required"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to create files and directories on the local filesystem where the targeted user may execute `gargoyle`, and the ability to craft a malicious `libgarglk.so` library."
