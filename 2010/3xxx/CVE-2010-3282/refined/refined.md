{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "When audit logging is enabled in Red Hat Directory Server and 389 Directory Server, changes to the `cn=config:nsslapd-rootpw` attribute result in the password value being logged in cleartext within the audit log.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure: The directory server's root password is logged in cleartext in the audit logs."
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of the directory server's root password, potentially allowing unauthorized access or control of the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to access the audit log file. Default permissions restrict access to the `nobody` user and root. An attacker would need to compromise one of these accounts or otherwise gain access to the log file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would require the ability to read the audit log file. This could be achieved by compromising the account running the directory server service or the root account, or by gaining access through some other means."
  },
  "fixes": [
      "The fix involves hashing the `nsslapd-rootpw` value before it is written to the audit log, similar to how user passwords are handled."
  ]
