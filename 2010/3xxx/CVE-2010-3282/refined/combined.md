# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-20 22:13:37 UTC  ``` When audit logging is enabled on Red Hat Directory Server and 389 Directory Server, changes to cn=config:nsslapd-rootpw result in the password value being logged in cleartext.  The audit log records an entry similar to the following:  dn: cn=config changetype: modify replace: nsslapd-rootpw nsslapd-rootpw: secret  User passwords, however, are not logged verbatim but in hashed form.  Although the directory server administrator can configure the path and permissions of the audit log, by default it is mode 0600, owned by the directory server user, and is located in the directory server log directory (/var/log/dirsrv/slapd-[hostname]), which is mode 0770 and owned by the directory server user ("nobody", by default)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-20 22:33:27 UTC  ``` I'm not overly familiar with Red Hat Directory Server or 389 DS, but I did install 389 in Fedora to look at this.  I'm not (yet) sure how to enable audit logging, but on preliminary inspection, I see the following configuration:  # grep audit dse.ldif nsslapd-auditlog: /var/log/dirsrv/slapd-odvfc13/audit nsslapd-auditlog-mode: 600 nsslapd-auditlog-maxlogsize: 100 nsslapd-auditlog-logrotationtime: 1 nsslapd-auditlog-logrotationtimeunit: day  Looking at default permissions, then:  # ls -al /var/log/dirsrv/ total 12 drwxr-xr-x   3 root   root   4096 Aug 20 16:03 . drwxr-xr-x. 16 root   root   4096 Aug 20 16:20 .. drwxrwx---   2 nobody nobody 4096 Aug 20 16:03 slapd-odvfc13 # ls -al /var/log/dirsrv/slapd-odvfc13/audit -rw------- 1 nobody root 0 Aug 20 16:03 /var/log/dirsrv/slapd-odvfc13/audit  The permissions here are secure.  Only user 'nobody' or 'root' have access to the logging directory, or the audit log file, as per default.  I admit that I'm not a big fan of using the 'nobody' user for services, because too many services have historically shared the same userid, so I would prefer to see in the future perhaps a dedicated user for the directory server.  Having said that, I see the exposure of this as being quite low and the 'nobody' account is unavailable for switching to due the shell being set to /sbin/nologin.  Realistically, this leaves only the root user being able to access the audit log.  And if you have root privileges, chances are you have more interesting things to do.  That's why I gave this AC:H, however perhaps it should also be Au:S since you would have to change context to another user (such as root or the user the directory server runs as).  Due to the above, we would rate this as a low impact issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c3)  Rich Megginson    2010-08-21 02:03:21 UTC  ``` Thanks Vincent.  So, what is the recommended solution?  Release an errata?  Release note this behavior?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-23 14:51:29 UTC  ``` This doesn't really fit the criteria to release an ASYNC erratum, because of the low impact.  We can and certainly should fix it along with a future update to RHDS, and it should probably be fixed in 389.  We should probably note that there is a small risk of information disclosure, but that risk is really small (you would need to expose this file in some way by manually changing permissions, and you also need to change that root user's password, _and_ have audit logging enabled).  Certainly it should be documented that there is a slight risk there.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c5)  Ulf Weltman    2010-08-23 18:24:18 UTC  ``` Vincent, HP will be required to release a patch ASAP for our customers.  On your side, if I read you correctly, you are suggesting a fix in the next regularly scheduled release and an asynchronous release notes update in the mean time.  If that is the case, can you embargo the release notes update until I can get the patch ready?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c6)  Rich Megginson    2010-08-23 21:27:10 UTC  ``` We would like to push out an update to our release notes by the middle of next week.  Will that be a problem?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-08-23 21:38:21 UTC  ``` Rich, do we have the patch that we would be using to fix the issue to provide to HP?  The fix should be consistent so that when we do issue RHDS updates, there are no unexpected changes or regressions from what HP is providing.  I also don't think there is a rush on our end to update the release notes.  If HP will be patching this right away for their customers, we shouldn't have a problem delaying any documentation/release note updates until that is done (and making sure the upstream 389 code is not updated until then either).  Ulf, Rich would be your contact point for release note updates.  SRT doesn't handle that sort of thing.  And yes, I think for something like this, and with it's low severity, it will either be issued in the next RHDS scheduled release _or_ in an ASYNC update if there are other more significant issues in the same component we would be fixing.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c8)  Rich Megginson    2010-08-23 21:57:29 UTC  ``` Vincent - Ulf has already submitted a patch.  We will most likely use the patch from Ulf in our code when we release the fix.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c9)  Ulf Weltman    2010-08-23 22:05:26 UTC  ``` Thanks Rich and Vincent.  The earliest I could release is September 15, our release train is not very flexible unfortunately.  Rich, you gave an initial nod to the fix method but I have made some minor updates since then.  Do I attach the new diff to this BZ or another?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c10)  Rich Megginson    2010-08-23 22:55:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c9)) > Thanks Rich and Vincent.

Yes - just attach the patches to this BZ.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c11)  Ulf Weltman    2010-08-24 01:09:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 440540](attachment.cgi?id=440540&action=diff "patch proposal") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=440540&action=edit "patch proposal") patch proposal  This adds hashing of nsslapd-rootpw in op_shared_modify.  It's not needed in op_shared_add since this attribute resides in cn=config which is never added, only modified.  The hashing is done after the pre-op plugins are called, just in case there is a pre-op plugin that needs the clear value.  Post-op plugins will find the hashed value but a determined plugin author could pass the clear value from a pre-op to a post-op plugin.  The userPassword hashing gets around this by squirreling away an unhashed value as unhashed#user#password for Winsync purposes, but it seems overkill for nsslapd-rootpw.  The existing hashing code in config_set_rootpw could be removed but it does no harm since it detects pre-hashed passwords and does not re-hash them.  Do you prefer that code is removed?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c12)  Rich Megginson    2010-08-25 23:03:17 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 440540](attachment.cgi?id=440540&action=diff "patch proposal") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=440540&action=edit "patch proposal") patch proposal  Looks good.  The formatting is a bit dodgy - looks like the original function uses tabs.  Where is mod->mod_bvalues[j]->bv_val allocated?  Is it safe to free it here?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c13)  Ulf Weltman    2010-08-28 00:01:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 441632](attachment.cgi?id=441632&action=diff "updated patch proposal") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=441632&action=edit "updated patch proposal") updated patch proposal  Oops, fixed the formatting.  Also moved the "if (strcasecmp (mod->mod_type, CONFIG_ROOTPW_ATTRIBUTE) != 0) continue;" up to the outer loop.  Regarding freeing mod->mod_bvalues[j]->bv_val, it's allocated by do_modify when it decodes the incoming BER.  It think it should be OK to free and replace, encoding of userPassword values happen in a similar way also in op_shared_modify.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c16)  Deon Ballard    2010-11-12 21:04:27 UTC  ``` Has HP released the fix to this yet?   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c17)  Ulf Weltman    2010-11-12 21:29:35 UTC  ``` This fix was released by HP on September 15.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c21)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-16 18:03:57 UTC  ``` Giving this the CVE name [CVE-2010-4174](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4174)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c22)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-16 18:05:58 UTC  ``` This is documented here:  <http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Release_Notes/Release_Notes-Bugs_Addressed-Known_Issues.html>  Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update to Red Hat Directory Server may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c24)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-16 18:14:23 UTC  ``` Created 389-ds tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 654054](show_bug.cgi?id=654054 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4174 RHDS/389: information disclosure in audit logs [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=625950#c25)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-16 22:29:58 UTC  ``` Actually, HP had previously assigned [CVE-2010-3282](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3282) to this issue, so we're going to use their CVE name and reject [CVE-2010-4174](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4174).
