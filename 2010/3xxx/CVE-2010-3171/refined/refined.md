{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-3171",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient isolation of the Math.random() function's seed across different domains.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-domain information leakage",
        "Predictable pseudo-random number generation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially predict the output of Math.random() in other domains, allowing them to perform cross-site information theft. The report also suggests that the insufficient entropy of the seed could enable more powerful attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious web page or script",
         "Cross-domain access"
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript in the victim's browser."
