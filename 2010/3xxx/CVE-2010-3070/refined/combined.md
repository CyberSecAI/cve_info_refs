Subject: CVE request: XSS in nusoap

Hi,

A XSS vulnerability has been reported against the nusoap PHP library caused
by insufficient sanitation of untrusted data ($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) --
CWE-79.

Original report against mantisbt:
<http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12312>

Report against nusoap (and further references):
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/forums/forum/193579/topic/3834005>

The fixes proposed by David Hicks[1] (from mantisbt) add escaping to some
other variables, but I haven't verified if they are actually exploitable (if
that's so, the patch might need to pass the charset to htmlentities too.)

[1]<http://git.mantisbt.org/?p=mantisbt.git;a=commit;h=edb817991b99cd5538f102be26865fde7c6b7212>

Could a CVE id be assigned?

Thanks,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=633011#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-09-12 13:17:05 UTC  ``` An XSS flaw has been reported against NuSOAP (original report against Mantis) [1] <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12312>  Report against NuSOAP: [2] <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/forums/forum/193579/topic/3834005>  David Hicks of Mantis community provided a temporary fix: [3] <http://git.mantisbt.org/?p=mantisbt.git;a=commit;h=edb817991b99cd5538f102be26865fde7c6b7212>  till the issue is addressed on NuSOAP side. The versions of php-nusoap packages, as shipped with Fedora release of 12 and 13 has been already updated: [4] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=629585](show_bug.cgi?id=629585 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3070 php-nusoap: XSS vulnerability due improper escaping of URLs") [5] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=629585#c2](show_bug.cgi?id=629585#c2 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3070 php-nusoap: XSS vulnerability due improper escaping of URLs") [6] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=629585#c3](show_bug.cgi?id=629585#c3 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3070 php-nusoap: XSS vulnerability due improper escaping of URLs")  But the versions of Mantis, as shipped with Fedora release of 12 and 13 are still prone to this issue (because it uses own embedded copy of the NuSOAP library and not the system one).  Please fix this issue by making Mantis to use the system php-NuSOAP library, instead of his embbeded own copy.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=633011#c1)  David Hicks    2010-09-15 00:35:43 UTC  ``` MantisBT 1.2.3 has been released to fix this XSS vulnerabilitiy in the bundled version of NuSOAP (and another few minor XSS issues).  <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=4C8FC573.3060900%40leetcode.net>  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mantisbt/files/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=633011#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-09-15 20:17:47 UTC  ``` Created mantis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 634341](show_bug.cgi?id=634341 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3070 CVE-2010-2574 CVE-2010-3303 mantis various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=633011#c3)  Gianluca Sforna    2010-10-01 20:15:18 UTC  ``` The update was pushed lately (1.1.8-4), looks like something did not work with auto-closing and commenting.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: mantis before 1.2.3 (XSS)

From release notes

"Issue #12312 covers an XSS vulnerability in the upstream NuSOAP library.
The fix has been applied to the library included in MantisBT releases,
and a patch has been submitted upstream for future releases of NuSOAP.
See <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12312> for further details.

Also included with 1.2.3 are another round of XSS fixes to MantisBT,
improved excel export, translation updates, and bug fixes to the SOAP
API, installation, plugin system, and email notifications."

So although it's both xss, one is in mantis itself and one in the
shipped/bundled nusoap, so we should have 2 CVEs.

| Summary | 0012312: NuSOAP WSDL XSS (cross-site scripting vulnerability) in Mantis 1.2.2 | | | | |
| Description | Hello!  My name is Bogdan Calin. I'm a security researcher at Acunetix (<http://www.acunetix.com>). You can contact me at this email address: bogdan [at] acunetix.com  While beta testing the latest version of our product (Acunetix WVS v7) we found a number of security vulnerabilities in various web applications.  The following vulnerabilities were found in Mantis (Version 1.2.2).   1. XSS in "/mantisbt\_1\_2\_2/api/soap/mantisconnect.php"    URI was set to 1<ScRiPt>prompt(923395)</ScRiPt>    The input is reflected inside a text element.    The input is reflected inside a tag element between double quotes.   Sample HTTP request to reproduce the problem:  GET /mantisbt\_1\_2\_2/api/soap/mantisconnect.php/1%3CScRiPt%3Eprompt(923395)%3C/ScRiPt%3E HTTP/1.1 Cookie: PHPSESSID=4a181a89451adb7b5d459ea3252b1f4a; MANTIS\_secure\_session=0; MANTIS\_PROJECT\_COOKIE=0 Host: webapps7:80 Connection: Keep-alive Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0)  If you have questions about these issues, please contact me by email.  Thanks in advance, Bogdan | | | | |
| Steps To Reproduce | 1. Visit [http://webapps7/mantisbt\_1\_2\_2/api/soap/mantisconnect.php/1%3CScRiPt%3Eprompt(923395)%3C/ScRiPt%3E](http://webapps7/mantisbt_1_2_2/api/soap/mantisconnect.php/1%3CScRiPt%3Eprompt%28923395%29%3C/ScRiPt%3E) 2. See a popup window that is confirming the XSS vulnerability. | | | | |

| [dhx](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=13334)   [dhx](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=13334)  2010-08-31 06:35  reporter    [~0026528](view.php?id=12312#c26528 "Direct link to note") | Thanks for the descriptive and informative bug report Bogdan.  If it's OK I'd like to print and frame this bug as one of the few examples we have of what defines a good bug report :)  I'll try and have this fixed shortly. I've also CC'd in Robert (our SOAP/MantisConnect specialist) and John (most likely person to roll out MantisBT 1.2.3).  Thanks again for finding this XSS bug (in a place most people wouldn't think of looking) and reporting it here so descriptively. |

Essentially they're not escaping variables/user-data before outputting it to HTML.  I'm guessing there are many more web applications (not just MantisBT) affected by this NuSOAP issue. |

I've been reporting vulnerabilities all week and didn't had time to investigate each of them properly. I will contact the NuSOAP guys to fix their code. If it's their code they should fix the problem, not you. Yes, I've quickly checked and there are many applications using NuSOAP. |

I'll attach a patch here in one moment (which I'll apply to our bundled version of NuSOAP). Their project seems a little bit dead to me so I doubt we'll see a fast upstream response on this issue :( |

If upstream makes a new release which resolves the problem we'll bundle the newer release with MantisBT (undoing the patch I have provided in this bug report).  Thanks Bodgan for your assistance and very helpful reporting :) |

Scott Nichol is alive and working on nusoap from time to time.  Btw, it seems to me that servers using the suhosin patch for PHP may be protected, as is the case on one Debian system I've tried and reproduce the problem.  Best regards, |

Subject: Unescaped PHP\_SELF XSS vulnerabilities in NuSOAP 0.9.5
Date: Thu, 02 Sep 2010 23:00:40 +1000
```
Package: nusoap
Version: 0.9.5-1
Owner: olivier.berger@it-sudparis.eu
Tags: security

Bogdan Calin of Acunetix discovered some cross site scripting
vulnerabilities in NuSOAP 0.9.5 relating to lack of escaping of
PHP_SELF. This is an issue because of potentially malicious URLs being
constructed along the lines of:

[http://site/soapserver.php/1%3CScRiPt%3Eprompt(923395)%3C/ScRiPt%3E](http://site/soapserver.php/1%3CScRiPt%3Eprompt%28923395%29%3C/ScRiPt%3E)

In such an event, NuSOAP will print a WSDL output page (service
description) containing the maliciously crafted URL.

An upstream bug report exists at
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/forums/forum/193579/topic/3834005>
and a preliminary patch has been provided by the MantisBT project (which
bundles NuSOAP) at: <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=12312>

Hi.

Thanks for reporting this.

After a quick analysis, I tend to believe that users of the standard PHP
5.3 apache module packages with "suhosin.server.strip On" are safe : the
%3C and likes are converted to question marks ('?').

Still, this deserves some fixing.

Any comments or help welcome.

Best regards,

I'm not so sure the whole of the patch proposed by the Mantis team is
completely justified, and here's another alternative (shorter but
sufficiant I think). Still waiting for some opinion of upstream on this.

Any comments ?

There's even a shorter version of the patch, provided by Raphael
Geissert (attached).

I've asked the security team to upload an updated 0.7.3 package for
squeeze/testing-security, and I'll prepare a version for 0.9.5 for
unstable.

FYI, the 0.9.5-2 package including the same fix is ready in :
        - URL: <http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/n/nusoap>
        - Source repository: deb-src <http://mentors.debian.net/debian> unstable main contrib non-free
        - dget <http://mentors.debian.net/debian/pool/main/n/nusoap/nusoap_0.9.5-2.dsc>

waiting for someone to sponsor it.
