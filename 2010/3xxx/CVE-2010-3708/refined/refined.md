{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The drools serialization format allows embedding class files. During deserialization, these class files are loaded by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running the drools engine. If a class file (controlled by an attacker) defines code within a static initializer, this code is executed during deserialization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Remote code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted serialized data",
      "Supply of a custom class via the serialization stream"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted serialized data stream to the vulnerable application. They must control the contents of the serialized data stream.",
      "more_info": "The vulnerability is present in JBoss Drools. The attacker embeds a malicious class file within the serialized data. The class file contains a static initializer which allows for code execution. Deserialization triggers the loading and initialization of the malicious class, leading to code execution"
