  "CVE-2010-3772": {
    "description": "Security researcher wushi of team509 reported that when a XUL tree had an HTML <div> element nested inside a <treechildren> element then code attempting to display content in the XUL tree would incorrectly treat the <div> element as a parent node to tree content underneath it resulting in incorrect indexes being calculated for the child content. These incorrect indexes were used in subsequent array operations which resulted in writing data past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could use this issue to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on their machine.",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of nested HTML elements within a XUL tree, specifically an HTML div element nested inside a <treechildren> element. The code incorrectly treats the <div> as a parent node, which leads to wrong index calculations for child content. This error results in out-of-bounds write operations.",
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash the victim's browser, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
     "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a malicious webpage containing a specifically crafted XUL tree with an HTML div nested within it. When a user opens this malicious webpage, the vulnerability is triggered.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML page with a specific structure involving a XUL tree, a <treechildren> element, and a nested HTML <div> element. The attacker then has to trick the user into opening the malicious webpage. No further specific capabilities are mentioned, however, a good understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript would be required."
