Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-3294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a flaw in the `apc.php` script, which is part of the Alternative PHP Cache (APC) extension. This script is intended for providing a detailed analysis of the internal workings of APC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to conduct a cross-site scripting attack. This could allow the attacker to execute malicious scripts within the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. An attacker could exploit the XSS vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL or injecting malicious code into the vulnerable `apc.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the server hosting the vulnerable `apc.php` script.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts that will be executed within the victim's browser.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Information:**
- The `apc.php` script is not deployed automatically during package installation. It needs to be manually copied to the web root to be exposed and be exploitable.
- The issue was addressed in `php-pecl-apc` version 3.1.4 and later.
- Red Hat assigned a "Low" severity rating to the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects versions prior to 3.1.4.
- The fix involves updating the php-pecl-apc package to version 3.1.9, which includes the patch for the XSS vulnerability.
- The fix also involves manual re-deployment of the `apc.php` script after upgrading the package.
- The affected products include Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and other distributions using affected versions of the APC extension.
