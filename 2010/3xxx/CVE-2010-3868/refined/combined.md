## Topic

Updated pki-ca, pki-util, and pki-common packages that fix three security
issues and add several enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Certificate System 8.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to
manage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments. Simple
Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is a PKI communication protocol
used to automatically enroll certificates for network devices.

The certificate authority allowed unauthenticated users to request the
one-time PIN in an SCEP request to be decrypted. An attacker able to sniff
an SCEP request from a network device could request the certificate
authority to decrypt the request, allowing them to obtain the one-time
PIN. With this update, the certificate authority only handles decryption
requests from authenticated registration authorities. (CVE-2010-3868)

The certificate authority allowed the one-time PIN used in SCEP requests
to be re-used. An attacker possessing a valid SCEP enrollment one-time PIN
could use it to generate an unlimited number of certificates.
(CVE-2010-3869)

The certificate authority used the MD5 hash algorithm to sign all SCEP
protocol responses. As MD5 is not collision resistant, an attacker could
use this flaw to perform an MD5 chosen-prefix collision attack to generate
attack-chosen output signed using the certificate authority's key.
(CVE-2004-2761)

This update also adds the following enhancements:

* New configuration options for the SCEP server can define the default and

allowed encryption and hash algorithms. These options allow disabling uses
of the weaker algorithms not required by network devices and prevent
possible downgrade attacks. These can be configured by adding the following
options to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file:

ca.scep.encryptionAlgorithm=DES3
 ca.scep.allowedEncryptionAlgorithms=DES3
 ca.scep.hashAlgorithm=SHA1
 ca.scep.allowedHashAlgorithms=SHA1,SHA256,SHA512

* With this update, the certificate authority's SCEP server is disabled by

default. The SCEP server can be enabled by adding the 'ca.scep.enable=true'
option to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file.

* A separate key pair can now be configured for use in SCEP communication.

Previously, the main certificate authority's key pair was used for SCEP
communication too. A designated SCEP key pair can be referenced by adding
a new option, ca.scep.nickname=[scep certificate nickname], to the
certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration file.

* The certificate authority now allows the size of nonces used in SCEP

requests to be restricted by adding a new option, ca.scep.nonceSizeLimit=
[number of bytes], to the certificate authority's CS.cfg configuration
file. The limit is set to 16 bytes in the default CS.cfg configuration
file.

All users of Red Hat Certificate System 8 should upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 12:52:15 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2004-2761](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-2761) to the following vulnerability:  The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is not collision resistant, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct spoofing attacks, as demonstrated by attacks on the use of MD5 in the signature algorithm of an X.509 certificate.  References: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/836068> <http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/199> <http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/067> <http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/> <http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/> <http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2008/12/30/md5-weaknesses-could-lead-to-certificate-forgery/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 13:30:44 UTC  ``` As noted in the Knowledgebase article, Red Hat Certificate System is configured to use SHA-1 hash algorithm by default:  <https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-15379>  It was discovered, however, that Red Hat / Dogtag Certificate System used MD5 algorithm for SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) protocol communication and provided no way to disable the use of MD5.  There are additional implementation properties that make an MD5 chosen-prefix collision attack more feasible against Certificate System's SCEP component:  - Main Certificate Authority's key pair used to issue certificates is used to secure SCEP communication too (to decrypt requests and sign responses).  - All SCEP responses are signed by CA, including negative / failure responses.  An attacker does not need to have a valid enrollment one-time PIN to get signed reply from the Certificate System.  - Certificate System does not limit the size of the the senderNonce provided in the SCEP request and which is echoed back in the SCEP reply.  It also did not provide its own senderNonce in SCEP reply packets.  Colliding prefix can be used as part of the sender nonce that is echoed back by the CA unchanged.  This may allow attacker to create certificate or CRL signed using CA's key and using MD5 has algorithms.  Following changes were done in the Certificate System to address this problem:  - Support for SHA hash function family (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) was added to Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.  These hash functions were previously supported in version 8.  SHA-1 hash function is now used by default.  - CS.cfg configuration file can now specify default and allowed algorithms to be used by the SCEP component, e.g.:     ca.scep.hashAlgorithm=SHA1     ca.scep.allowedHashAlgorithms=SHA1,SHA256,SHA512 Similar options - ca.scep.encryptionAlgorithm and ca.scep.allowedEncryptionAlgorithms - can be used to configure encryption algorithm preferences.  Allowed algorithms list can be used to avoid downgrade to the use of weaker algorithms in cases where network devices tries to use DES/MD5 first for compatibility with older SCEP specifications.  The use of SHA hash algorithm avoids the MD5 collision problem.  Following additional changes aim to make the attack less feasible in configuration where the use of MD5 can not be disabled.  - It is possible to limit the size of the nonce copied from SCEP requests to SCEP responses using ca.scep.nonceSizeLimit option.  Default CS.cfg file sets the limit to 16 bytes.  - SCEP replies now include server-generated nonce.  - Separate key pair can be used for SCEP communication.  It can be specified in the CS.cfg configuration using ca.scep.nickname option.  - SCEP component is disabled by default.  It can be enabled by adding ca.scep.enable=true to the CS.cfg configuration file.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2010-11-02 23:14:51 UTC  ``` Is the intent of this bug to phase out MD5 usage in programs (i.e. replacing it with SHA256?) in Red Hat products?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-03 10:07:56 UTC  ``` Not a phase out all MD5, but phase out where needed.  Results of the efforts that were done in Fedora to add support for stronger hashes are to be seen in future Red Hat products too, of course.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:07:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 7.3  Via RHSA-2010:0837 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0837.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:12:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 8  Via RHSA-2010:0838 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0838.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-09 13:58:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=648886#c1))  > Following changes were done in the Certificate System to address this > problem: >  > - Support for SHA hash function family (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) was added > to Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=648882#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 12:33:49 UTC  ``` Red Hat / Dogtag Certificate System's Certificate Authority can be asked to decrypt one-time PIN used in the SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) protocol requests.  This feature is intended to be used by Registration Authorities that act as proxies between CA users (e.g. network devices enrolling using SCEP protocol) and CA itself.  However, Red Hat Certificate System lacked proper authentication mechanisms to ensure such decryption requests are only replied if sent form the configured Registration Authority.  An attacker able to sniff SCEP request of the network could use this flaw to request decryption of the sniffed request and obtain one-time PIN.  Red Hat Certificate System updates add proper authentication, only configured authenticated Registration Authorities can request SCEP one-time PIN decryption.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=648882#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:06:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 7.3  Via RHSA-2010:0837 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0837.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=648882#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:12:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 8  Via RHSA-2010:0838 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0838.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=648882#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-09 13:46:18 UTC  ``` <https://fedorahosted.org/pki/changeset/1261>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=648883#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 12:41:14 UTC  ``` Red Hat / Dogtag Certificate System did not prevent re-use of the one-time PIN used in the SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) protocol enrollment requests.  The check was done to ensure that PIN is valid, but the PIN was never removed from the list of valid PINs once it was used.  An attacker possessing a valid SCEP enrollment one-time PIN could use it to generate an unlimited number of certificates.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=648883#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:06:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 7.3  Via RHSA-2010:0837 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0837.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=648883#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:12:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 8  Via RHSA-2010:0838 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0838.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=648883#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-09 13:47:14 UTC  ``` <https://fedorahosted.org/pki/changeset/1246>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=648882#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-02 12:33:49 UTC  ``` Red Hat / Dogtag Certificate System's Certificate Authority can be asked to decrypt one-time PIN used in the SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) protocol requests.  This feature is intended to be used by Registration Authorities that act as proxies between CA users (e.g. network devices enrolling using SCEP protocol) and CA itself.  However, Red Hat Certificate System lacked proper authentication mechanisms to ensure such decryption requests are only replied if sent form the configured Registration Authority.  An attacker able to sniff SCEP request of the network could use this flaw to request decryption of the sniffed request and obtain one-time PIN.  Red Hat Certificate System updates add proper authentication, only configured authenticated Registration Authorities can request SCEP one-time PIN decryption.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=648882#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:06:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 7.3  Via RHSA-2010:0837 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0837.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=648882#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-08 20:12:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 8  Via RHSA-2010:0838 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0838.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=648882#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-09 13:46:18 UTC  ``` <https://fedorahosted.org/pki/changeset/1261>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
