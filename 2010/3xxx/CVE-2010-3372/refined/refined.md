```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Bad handling of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable could lead to an attacker injecting malicious libraries.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution by loading malicious shared libraries.
- Attack vectors: Exploiting the vulnerability requires manipulating the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the vulnerable application is executed.
