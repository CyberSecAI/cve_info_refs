# Release Announcement for ARC version 0.8.3

October 29, 2010

The 0.8.3 is a minor bugfix release for the [0.8.2](http://www.nordugrid.org/arc/releases/0_8_2) release.

The Advanced Resource Connector as of version 0.8.3 is an open source
software solution that enables production quality computational grids
for high throughput computing, encompassing a wide range of size and
purpose. The middleware integrates computing resources (typically,
computing clusters managed by a batch system) and, to a lesser extent,
storage services, making them available via an information system and
a common secure grid layer. The middleware builds upon standard open
source solutions such as OpenSSL, OpenLDAP and libxml2, as well as
some Globus Toolkit 5 pre-WS libraries. It relies on well-tested
technologies in creating unique ARC-specific services and tools. ARC
developers strive to achieve simplicity, non-invasiveness, high
performance, stability and reliability. With release 0.8.3 ARC
middleware is officially supported on major Linux flavours, and is known
to operate smoothly on other Linux systems, with a variety of batch
job management systems. Starting from release 0.8.2 several of the new
components are also available on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X
platforms.

### Known issues as of 0.8.3 release

* Some users have ran into problems with Python path not set correctly
  on 64bit systems ([bug #1946](http://bugzilla.nordugrid.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1946)).

  Proposed workaround: PYTHONPATH variable needs to include both
  /opt/nordugrid/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ and
  /opt/nordugrid/lib64/python2.4/site-packages/
  depending on your Python version.
* The new GUI, arcjobtool does not work on Ubuntu.
* The new GUI, arcjobtool requires you to install nordugrid-arc-nox-plugins-globus if you want to submit to ARC-CE resources.
* Deployment of the replicated A-hash for Chelonia
  Deployment of the replicated A-hash for Chelonia requires at least
  version 4.6 of db4 while db4-4.3 is provided by the RHEL5
  distribution. The replicated A-hash has been validated on 64-bit RHEL5
  with db4-4.7 and bsddb3-4.8.2, neither of which are provided as part
  of the RHEL5 distribution.

  db4-4.7 may be downloaded from Oracle and built from the source
  tarball (see "Previous releases" on
  [Oracle downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/downloads/)).
  It can be installed in either /usr (doesn't conflict with 4.3) or
  /usr/local (it is automatically discovered by bsddb3 in either
  location).

  db4-4.8 was found not to work and according to the release notes
  bsddb3 doesn't support db4-5.0 yet.

  bsddb3 provides the required python bindings to db4. It can be
  downloaded from
  [here](http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/b/bsddb3/bsddb3-4.8.2.tar.gz).
  Build and install instructions are included, see README.txt after
  unpacking the tarball. If e.g. db4-4.7 is installed in /usr or
  /usr/local you should be able to build and install bsddb3 with
  "python setup.py build; python setup.py install".

### To get ARC 0.8.3:

The standalone client tarballs are available from: <http://download.nordugrid.org>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
