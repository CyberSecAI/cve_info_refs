```
Package: mono-debugger
Version: 2.4.3-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
User: team@security.debian.org
Usertags: ldpath

Hello,

During a review of the Debian archive, I've found your package to
contain a script that can be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code.

The vulnerability is introduced by an insecure change to
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and environment variable used by ld.so(8) to look for
libraries on a directory other than the standard paths.

Vulnerable code follows:

/usr/bin/mdb-symbolreader line 2:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
/usr/bin/mdb line 2:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"

When there's an empty item on the colon-separated list of
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so treats it as '.' (i.e. CWD/$PWD.)
If the given script is executed from a directory where a potential,
local, attacker can write files to, there's a chance to exploit this
bug.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE id [CVE-2010-3369](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3369). Please make sure
you mention it when forwarding this report to upstream and when fixing
this bug (everywhere: upstream and here at Debian.)

[0] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3369>
[1] <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3369>

Sincerely,
Raphael Geissert

Thanks for the patch!

You can if you wish, but I intend(ed) to prepare maintainer uploads to
fix these bugs this weekend. I'll incorporate your patches (with
attribution, of course) into a maintainer upload then.

If I don't get to it for any reason then please proceed.

Cheers,
Iain

Please hold. That patch does not cut it. See:

    (
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH="::"
        echo LD_LIBRARY_PATH="@libdir@${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
    )

    # => LD_LIBRARY_PATH=@libdir@:::

OK, it seems like you care for and understand this issue much more
than anyone on the team, so please just upload when you are ready.

You can come to #debian-cli and fix directly in VCS too if you
wish. Please make sure upstream is aware of your fixes too.

Thanks,
Iain

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
