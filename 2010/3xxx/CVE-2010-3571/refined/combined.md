# Advisory Details

October 12th, 2010
## Oracle Sun Java ICC Profile Unicode Description Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-203ZDI-CAN-802

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-3571](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3571) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Java Runtime](http://java.sun.com/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['10577']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle's Java Runtime Environment. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the color profile parser. When processing a particular Tag structure out of a color profile, the parser will read a 32-bit integer and use it to calculate the size for a memory allocation. Due to the result being larger than 32 bits, an integer overflow will occur. This will lead to code execution under the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuoct2010-176258.html> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-06-30 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-10-12 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
Specially crafted ppt files could cause a heap based buffer overflow in
OpenOffice\_org Impress. Attackers could exploit that to crash
OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936).
This update also fixes numerous non-security bugs. Please refer to the
package changelog for details.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- acroread/acroread\_ja
Specially crafted PDF documents could crash acroread or lead to execution
of arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2883, CVE-2010-2884, CVE-2010-2887,
CVE-2010-2889, CVE-2010-2890, CVE-2010-3619, CVE-2010-3620, CVE-2010-3621,

SUSE Moblin 2.0-2.1
- cifs-mount/samba
A buffer overflow in the sid\_parse() function of samba could potentially
be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-3069).
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.0-2.1
- dbus-1-glib
A flaw in dbus-glib was fixed that allowed other local programs to
bypass the 'access' flag on properties. (CVE-2010-1172)
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- festival
festival\_server uses an unsafe LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. Local users could exploit
that to execute code as another user if that user runs festival\_server.
CVE-2010-3996 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- freetype2
When loading specially crafted font files applications linked against
freetype2 could crash or potentially even execute arbitrary code

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

---

## 1. Overview:

The Sun 1.6.0 Java release includes the Sun Java 6 Runtime Environment and
the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Sun Java 6 Runtime
Environment and the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the "Oracle Java SE and Java
for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory" page, listed in the References
section. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1321](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1321.html), [CVE-2010-3541](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3541.html), [CVE-2010-3548](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3548.html), [CVE-2010-3549](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3549.html), [CVE-2010-3550](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3550.html), [CVE-2010-3551](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3551.html), [CVE-2010-3552](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3552.html), [CVE-2010-3553](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3553.html), [CVE-2010-3554](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3554.html), [CVE-2010-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3555.html), [CVE-2010-3556](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3556.html), [CVE-2010-3557](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3557.html), [CVE-2010-3558](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3558.html), [CVE-2010-3559](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3559.html), [CVE-2010-3560](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3560.html), [CVE-2010-3561](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3561.html), [CVE-2010-3562](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3562.html), [CVE-2010-3563](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3563.html), [CVE-2010-3565](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3565.html), [CVE-2010-3566](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3566.html), [CVE-2010-3567](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3567.html), [CVE-2010-3568](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3568.html), [CVE-2010-3569](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3569.html), [CVE-2010-3570](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3570.html), [CVE-2010-3571](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3571.html), [CVE-2010-3572](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3572.html), [CVE-2010-3573](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3573.html) and [CVE-2010-3574](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3574.html) to these issues.

The RHSA-2010:0337 update mitigated a man-in-the-middle attack in the way
the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update
implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC
5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3555.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0770.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.6.0-sun installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0 | Medium | See Recommended Actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. It is recommended that customers migrate to one of Avaya's conferencing solutions including Aura® Conferencing 7.0 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

```
```

3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.
```
```

```
```
  * Hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Fusion.
```
```
 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.
```
```
    VMware would like to thank Claudio Criscione of Secure Networking
    for reporting this issue to us.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

More information about this vulnerability can be found in the security advisory issued by HP:

## 2. Avaya System Products with HP-UX Running Java:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Proactive Contact | 3.0.x | Low | Upgrade to PC 4.2.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.
