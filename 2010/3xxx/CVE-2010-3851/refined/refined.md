{
  "CVE-2010-3851": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The libguestfs library does not allow the format of a disk to be specified explicitly. This can cause issues when the library is used to administer an image where a malicious guest admin can exploit automatic image format detection in qemu.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing disk format specifier when adding a disk leading to arbitrary file read on host",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious guest administrator can read arbitrary files on the host system by forging an image header with a backing store.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest administrator crafts a disk image with a forged header to trick the libguestfs tool, leading to arbitrary file reads on the host system when the tool is used to manage the disk.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious guest administrator with the ability to craft disk images."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "libguestfs does not explicitly specify the disk format when adding a disk, relying on automatic detection by QEMU.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the automatic image format detection within QEMU, which can be exploited by a crafted image.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious guest can potentially read arbitrary files on the host by crafting a disk image that uses a backing file on the host's filesystem.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack involves a malicious guest crafting a disk image (e.g., a qcow2, VMDK, or VDI header within a raw disk image) that specifies a backing file on the host system, and also injecting a modified binary into the guest.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires control over the guest and an understanding of how libguestfs tools operate. They also need to be able to create a malicious image with a forged header."
