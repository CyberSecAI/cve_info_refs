```
Package: henplus
Version: 0.9.7.ds1-2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
User: team@security.debian.org
Usertags: ldpath

Hello,

During a review of the Debian archive, I've found your package to
contain a script that can be abused by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code.

The vulnerability is introduced by an insecure change to
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and environment variable used by ld.so(8) to look for
libraries on a directory other than the standard paths.

Vulnerable code follows:

/usr/bin/henplus line 32:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/jni"

When there's an empty item on the colon-separated list of
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, ld.so treats it as '.' (i.e. CWD/$PWD.)
If the given script is executed from a directory where a potential,
local, attacker can write files to, there's a chance to exploit this
bug.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE id [CVE-2010-3358](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3358). Please make sure
you mention it when forwarding this report to upstream and when fixing
this bug (everywhere: upstream and here at Debian.)

Sincerely,
Raphael Geissert
