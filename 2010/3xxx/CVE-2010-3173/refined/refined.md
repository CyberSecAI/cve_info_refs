{
  "CVE-2010-3173": {
    "root_cause": "The SSL DHE (Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) mode implementation for key exchanges in SeaMonkey and Firefox accepted DHE keys that were 256 bits in length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of weak cryptographic keys",
      "Inadequate enforcement of minimum key lengths"
    ],
    "impact": "Acceptance of weak DHE keys allowed attackers to more easily break the cryptographic protection mechanisms through brute-force attacks, weakening the security of SSL connections.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and manipulate the key exchange process, which includes having the ability to act as a rogue server, or modify the connection to a legitimate server."
