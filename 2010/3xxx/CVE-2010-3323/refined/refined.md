Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3323:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the `SPLUNKD_SESSION_KEY` parameter being susceptible to session hijacking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application exposes the `SPLUNKD_SESSION_KEY` parameter, making it vulnerable to session hijacking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially hijack a valid user's session. This could lead to unauthorized access to the Splunk application, potentially allowing them to view sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into visiting a specially crafted web page. This web page would be designed to disclose the user's valid `splunkd` session key to the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page and trick a valid, authenticated Splunk user into visiting it. The attacker does not need any initial access to the Splunk instance itself.
