Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-3355:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `ember` script (version 0.5.7) incorrectly sets the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. It prepends `$prefix/lib/ember:` to the existing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. If `$prefix/lib/ember` is empty or results in an empty string (which it apparently could, although not explicitly stated in the report), this effectively introduces an empty item in the colon-separated `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Library Loading:** When `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` contains an empty item, the dynamic linker (`ld.so`) interprets it as the current working directory (`.`).
*   **Path Traversal**: By design, the application is insecure when executed from a directory where a malicious user can write files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can place a malicious shared library (a Trojan horse) in the same directory where the `ember` script is executed. Because of the way `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set, the malicious library can be loaded instead of the intended one when `ember` is run. This gives the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the `ember` script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have write access to the directory from where the vulnerable `ember` script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system where the vulnerable `ember` script is installed.
*   **Write Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to write files (create a malicious shared library) in the current working directory from where the ember script is executed.
*   **Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into executing the vulnerable `ember` script from the attacker controlled directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `ember` version 0.5.7-1 and is fixed in version 0.5.7-1.1.
*   The fix involves proper escaping of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to avoid the empty path issue, although the specific details of the fix are not explicitly included.
*   The report mentions that this is a "grave" security issue.
