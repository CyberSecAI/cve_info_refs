patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

## Details

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and

SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject

arbitrary content at the beginning of the user's session. USN-923-1

disabled SSL/TLS renegotiation by default; this update implements

the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC 5746,

and thus supports secure renegotiation between updated clients and

servers. ([CVE-2009-3555](/security/CVE-2009-3555))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate

request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker to

trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients. ([CVE-2010-3541](/security/CVE-2010-3541))

It was discovered that JNDI could leak information that would allow an

attacker to to access information about otherwise-protected internal

network names. ([CVE-2010-3548](/security/CVE-2010-3548))

It was discovered that HttpURLConnection improperly handled the

"chunked" transfer encoding method, which could allow attackers to

conduct HTTP response splitting attacks. ([CVE-2010-3549](/security/CVE-2010-3549))

It was discovered that the NetworkInterface class improperly

checked the network "connect" permissions for local network

addresses. This could allow an attacker to read local network

addresses. ([CVE-2010-3551](/security/CVE-2010-3551))

It was discovered that UIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection

usage, allowing an attacker to create objects. ([CVE-2010-3553](/security/CVE-2010-3553))

It was discovered that multiple flaws in the CORBA reflection

implementation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by

misusing permissions granted to certain system objects. ([CVE-2010-3554](/security/CVE-2010-3554))

It was discovered that unspecified flaws in the Swing library could

allow untrusted applications to modify the behavior and state of

certain JDK classes. ([CVE-2010-3557](/security/CVE-2010-3557))

It was discovered that the privileged accept method of the ServerSocket

class in the CORBA implementation allowed it to receive connections

from any host, instead of just the host of the current connection.

An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined by

network permissions. ([CVE-2010-3561](/security/CVE-2010-3561))

It was discovered that there exists a double free in java's

indexColorModel that could allow an attacker to cause an applet

or application to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privilege of the user running the java applet or

application. ([CVE-2010-3562](/security/CVE-2010-3562))

It was discovered that the Kerberos implementation improperly checked

AP-REQ requests, which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of

service against the receiving JVM. ([CVE-2010-3564](/security/CVE-2010-3564))

It was discovered that improper checks of unspecified image metadata in

JPEGImageWriter.writeImage of the imageio API could allow an attacker

to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running a

java applet or application. ([CVE-2010-3565](/security/CVE-2010-3565))

It was discovered that an unspecified vulnerability in the ICC

profile handling code could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user running a java applet or

application. ([CVE-2010-3566](/security/CVE-2010-3566))

It was discovered that a miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering

implementation would allow out-of-bounds memory access. This could

allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user running a java application. ([CVE-2010-3567](/security/CVE-2010-3567))

It was discovered that an unspecified race condition in the way

objects were deserialized could allow an attacker to cause an applet

or application to misuse the privileges of the user running the java

applet or application. ([CVE-2010-3568](/security/CVE-2010-3568))

It was discovered that the defaultReadObject of the Serialization

API could be tricked into setting a volatile field multiple times.

This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user running a java applet or application.

([CVE-2010-3569](/security/CVE-2010-3569))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate

request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker to

trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients. ([CVE-2010-3573](/security/CVE-2010-3573))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class improperly checked

whether the calling code was granted the "allowHttpTrace" permission,

allowing an attacker to create HTTP TRACE requests. ([CVE-2010-3574](/security/CVE-2010-3574))

java-1.6.0-sun security update (RHSA-2010-0770)

Original Release Date: October 29, 2010

Last Revised: October 10, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-307

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Sun 1.6.0 Java release includes the Sun Java 6 Runtime Environment and
the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Sun Java 6 Runtime
Environment and the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the "Oracle Java SE and Java
for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory" page, listed in the References
section. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1321](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1321.html), [CVE-2010-3541](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3541.html), [CVE-2010-3548](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3548.html), [CVE-2010-3549](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3549.html), [CVE-2010-3550](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3550.html), [CVE-2010-3551](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3551.html), [CVE-2010-3552](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3552.html), [CVE-2010-3553](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3553.html), [CVE-2010-3554](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3554.html), [CVE-2010-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3555.html), [CVE-2010-3556](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3556.html), [CVE-2010-3557](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3557.html), [CVE-2010-3558](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3558.html), [CVE-2010-3559](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3559.html), [CVE-2010-3560](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3560.html), [CVE-2010-3561](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3561.html), [CVE-2010-3562](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3562.html), [CVE-2010-3563](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3563.html), [CVE-2010-3565](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3565.html), [CVE-2010-3566](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3566.html), [CVE-2010-3567](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3567.html), [CVE-2010-3568](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3568.html), [CVE-2010-3569](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3569.html), [CVE-2010-3570](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3570.html), [CVE-2010-3571](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3571.html), [CVE-2010-3572](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3572.html), [CVE-2010-3573](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3573.html) and [CVE-2010-3574](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3574.html) to these issues.

The RHSA-2010:0337 update mitigated a man-in-the-middle attack in the way
the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update
implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC
5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3555.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0770.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.6.0-sun installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0 | Medium | See Recommended Actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. It is recommended that customers migrate to one of Avaya's conferencing solutions including Aura® Conferencing 7.0 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

java-1.6.0-openjdk security and bug fix update (RHSA-2010-0768)

Original Release Date: October 29, 2010

Last Revised: August 20, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-308

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit.

defaultReadObject of the Serialization API could be tricked into setting a
volatile field multiple times, which could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the applet
or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3569](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3569.html) to this issue.

Race condition in the way objects were deserialized could allow an
untrusted applet or application to misuse the privileges of the user
running the applet or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3568](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3568.html) to this issue.

Miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering implementation caused
out-of-bounds memory access, which could allow remote attackers to execute
code with the privileges of the user running the java process.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3567](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3567.html) to this issue.

JPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the imageio API improperly checked certain
image metadata, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the user running the applet or application.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3565](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3565.html) to this issue.

Double free in IndexColorModel could cause an untrusted applet or
application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the applet or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3562](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3562.html) to this issue.

The privileged accept method of the ServerSocket class in the Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) implementation in OpenJDK allowed it to
receive connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current
connection. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined
by network permissions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3561](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3561.html) to this issue.

Flaws in the Swing library could allow an untrusted application to modify
the behavior and state of certain JDK classes. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3557](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3557.html) to this issue.

Flaws in the CORBA implementation could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code by misusing permissions granted to certain system objects.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3554](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3554.html) to this issue.

UIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection usage, allowing untrusted
callers to create objects via ProxyLazyValue values. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3553](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3553.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection improperly handled the "chunked" transfer encoding
method, which could allow remote attackers to conduct HTTP response
splitting attacks. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3549](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3549.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection improperly checked whether the calling code was granted
the "allowHttpTrace" permission, allowing untrusted code to create HTTP
TRACE requests. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3574](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3574.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection did not validate request headers set by applets, which
could allow remote attackers to trigger actions otherwise restricted to
HTTP clients. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-3541](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3541.html) and [CVE-2010-3573](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3573.html) to these issues.

The Kerberos implementation improperly checked the sanity of AP-REQ
requests, which could cause a denial of service condition in the receiving
Java Virtual Machine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3564](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3564.html) to this issue.

The RHSA-2010:0339 update mitigated a man-in-the-middle attack in the way
the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update
implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC
5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3555.html) to this issue.

The NetworkInterface class improperly checked the network "connect"
permissions for local network addresses, which could allow remote attackers
to read local network addresses. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3551](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3551.html) to this issue.

Information leak flaw in the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
could allow a remote attacker to access information about
otherwise-protected internal network names. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3548](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3548.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0768.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.6.0-openjdk installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0 | Medium | See recommended actions and Mitigating Factors table below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. It is recommended that customers migrate to one of Avaya's conferencing solutions including Aura® Conferencing 7.0 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Platform | 1.1, 6.0 thru 6.0.3.5.3 | Low | Upgrade to SP6.0 Patch 6.0.3.6.3 or later. Rated a Low Risk since the jdk in Domain-0 is not a daemon and is used in a very limited fashion for a single application that is not accessible through the network interface. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## 1. Overview:

**Title:** HPSBUX02608 SSRT100333 rev.1 - HP-UX Running Java, Remote Execution of Arbitrary Code, Disclosure of Information, and Other Vulnerabilities

**Potential Impact:** Remote execution of arbitrary code, disclosure of information, and other vulnerabilities.

**Summary:** Potential security vulnerabilities have been identified in
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Developer Kit (JDK) running on
HP-UX. These vulnerabilities could allow remote execution of arbitrary
code, disclosure of information, and other vulnerabilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names

## 2. Avaya System Products with HP-UX Running Java:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Proactive Contact | 3.0.x | Low | Upgrade to PC 4.2.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.

 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.
