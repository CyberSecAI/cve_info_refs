```
{
  "Root cause": "The glibc dynamic linker/loader (ld.so) incorrectly expands the $ORIGIN dynamic string token in the LD_AUDIT environment variable for setuid/setgid programs. This violates the ELF specification recommendation to not perform $ORIGIN expansion for such privileged programs.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of $ORIGIN in LD_AUDIT",
    "Failure to adhere to ELF specification guidelines for setuid/setgid programs",
     "Insufficient restrictions on LD_AUDIT environment variable for setuid/setgid binaries",
    "Reusing DT_NEEDED resolution infrastructure for LD_AUDIT support without proper security measures"
  ],
  "Impact": "Local privilege escalation to root. An attacker can execute arbitrary code as root by exploiting the insecure $ORIGIN expansion.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Manipulating LD_AUDIT to load a malicious shared object (DSO).",
    "Creating a hard link to a setuid/setgid binary in an attacker-controlled directory."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user with the ability to create a hard link to a setuid/setgid binary in a directory they control and the ability to set environment variables. Write access to the filesystem containing the setuid/setgid binary. Additionally the target binary must be readable to the user."
