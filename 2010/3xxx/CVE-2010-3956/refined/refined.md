**2. Extracted Information for CVE-2010-3956:**

   *   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
        *   The vulnerability is caused by the OpenType Font (OTF) driver not properly indexing an array when parsing OpenType fonts. This improper indexing can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
        *   **Improper Array Indexing:** The OTF driver does not correctly handle array indexing when parsing OpenType fonts leading to memory corruption.
        *   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.

   *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, gaining complete control of the system.
        *   **System Compromise:** An attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
   *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Network Share:** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, an attacker could host a specially crafted OpenType font on a network share. When a user navigates to this share in Windows Explorer, the preview mechanism triggers the vulnerability.
        *   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a website containing a specially crafted font that triggers the vulnerability when visited by a user.
        *   **Local Application:** On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems, an attacker would need to be logged on locally to execute a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

   *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   **Remote Network Share (Vista and later):** The attacker needs a network share accessible to the target or the ability to host a malicious website.
        *   **Local Access (XP and Server 2003):** The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system locally and run a malicious application.
        *   **Malicious Font File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted OpenType font to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects systems where the OpenType Font driver parses specially crafted fonts.
* The vulnerability exists in how the driver indexes the array when processing the font.

**Mitigations/Workarounds (from the Microsoft Bulletin):**

*   **Disable Preview and Details Panes:** Disabling the preview and details panes in Windows Explorer can prevent the automatic triggering of the vulnerability when browsing a network share. This does not prevent exploitation via other attack vectors.

**Update:**

* The Microsoft security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the OpenType Font driver indexes the array.
