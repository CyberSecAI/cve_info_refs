Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `FastBackServer.exe` application, which listens on TCP port 11460 by default.
*   A vulnerable function within this application uses values directly from received network packets as the size and data for `memcpy` calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the size and data values received from network packets before using them in `memcpy` operations.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** By providing crafted size and data values, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
*   **Complete Compromise:** The code execution occurs in the context of the `fastback` server, potentially giving the attacker full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out over the network by sending crafted packets to the vulnerable server listening on TCP port 11460.
*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need to be present on the local network or have any authentication to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system where the vulnerable `FastBackServer.exe` is running.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-10-182, and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).
*   The vulnerability affects IBM Tivoli Storage Manager FastBack.
*   A Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS filter (ID 9488) is available to protect against this vulnerability.
