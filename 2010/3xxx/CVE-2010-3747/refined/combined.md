# Advisory Details

October 15th, 2010
## RealNetworks RealPlayer ActiveX Control CDDA URI Uninitialized Pointer Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-210ZDI-CAN-600

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-3747](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3747) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [RealNetworks](http://www.real.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [RealPlayer](http://www.real.com) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9337']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The specific flaw exists during the parsing of long CDDA URIs due to a failure to initialize a particular component of an object. The application will later call a method in the object leading to the uninitialized pointer being called. If an attacker can place data they control at the uninitialized location, the application will call malicious pointer which can lead to code execution under the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://service.real.com/realplayer/security/10152010_player/en/> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2009-11-24 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-10-15 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

This module exploits a initialization flaw within RealPlayer 11/11.1 and
RealPlayer SP 1.0 - 1.1.4. An abnormally long CDDA URI causes an object
initialization failure. However, this failure is improperly handled and
uninitialized memory executed.
