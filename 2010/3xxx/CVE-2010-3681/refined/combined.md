Subject: Re: CVE Request -- MySQL v5.1.49 -- multiple DoS
 flaws

Sorry for the delay...

There are several issues of the same bug type, but based solely on the
"Version" field in the associated MySQL bug IDs, it appears that each
issue has a different set of affected (fixed?) versions.  So these all
wind up being SPLIT from each other.

> 1, Security Fix: After changing the values of the innodb_file_format or
>                 innodb_file_per_table configuration parameters, DDL

>   Reason:       Assertion failure leading to server abort.

CVE-2010-3676

> 2, Security Fix: Joins involving a table with a unique SET column could cause
>                 a server crash. (Bug#54575)
>   References:   <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54575>

>                 for IN() or CASE operations when NULL arguments were either
>                 passed explicitly as arguments (for IN()) or implicitly

Description:
The assert happens in ha_myisam.cc line 1596:
---------------------------------------------
int ha_myisam::index_next(uchar *buf)
{
  MYSQL_INDEX_READ_ROW_START(table_share->db.str, table_share->table_name.str);
  DBUG_ASSERT(inited==INDEX);   <------------
  ha_statistic_increment(&SSV::ha_read_next_count);
  int error=mi_rnext(file,buf,active_index);
  table->status=error ? STATUS_NOT_FOUND: 0;
  MYSQL_INDEX_READ_ROW_DONE(error);
  return error;
}

My script:
----------
--disable_warnings
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
--enable_warnings
CREATE TABLE t1  ( pk INT , PRIMARY KEY (pk));
HANDLER t1 OPEN AS handler_a;
HANDLER handler_a READ FIRST;
HANDLER handler_a READ `PRIMARY` NEXT;

DROP TABLE t1;

3423 Ramil Kalimullin	2010-06-09
      Fix for [bug #54007](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=54007): assert in ha_myisam::index_next, HANDLER

      Problem: the server missed the fact that one can read from
      2 indexes alternately using HANDLER interface.

      Fix: check if the same (initialized) index is involved
      reading next/prev values from the index.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

the mipv6 daemon did not check the origin of netlink messages, therefore
allowing local users to spoof messages (CVE-2010-2522).
remote attackers could cause buffer overflows in mipv6d (CVE-2010-2523).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- mysql
- local users could delete data files for tables of other users
(CVE-2010-1626).
- authenticated users could gather information for tables they
should not have access to (CVE-2010-1849)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-1848)
- authenticated users could potentially execute arbitrary code as
the user running mysqld (CVE-2010-1850)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-3677,
CVE-2010-3678, CVE-2010-3681, CVE-2010-3682, CVE-2010-3683)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1
- postgresql
PostgreSQL functions implemented in Perl or TCL shared a global state
even across different user user ids. A user could therefore influence
functions of other users in an unexpected or even malicious way
(CVE-2010-3433).
PostgreSQL was updated to version 8.1.22 which fixes the security issue.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3
- squid3
A remote trusted client can cause a NULL pointer dereference within
squid to make it crash. (CVE-2010-3072: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

This issue affects the versions of the mysql package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this flaw as having low security impact, as exploitation of this issue would mean only a temporary denial of service, since the mysql daemon shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 will be automatically restarted after the abort.  A future update may address this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  --  This issue affects the versions of the mysql package, as shipped with Fedora release of 12 and 13.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=628680#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-08-31 12:55:00 UTC  ``` CVE Request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/08/30/8>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=628680#c13)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-09-23 09:33:36 UTC  ``` Created mysql tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 636780](show_bug.cgi?id=636780 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2010-3676 CVE-2010-3677 CVE-2010-3678 CVE-2010-3679 CVE-2010-3680 CVE-2010-3681 CVE-2010-3682 CVE-2010-3683 mysql various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=628680#c14)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-09-29 08:43:38 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2010-3681](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3681) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=628680#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-03 20:05:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0824 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0824.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=628680#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-11-03 20:22:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0825 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0825.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=628680#c20)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-03 20:51:00 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of mysql as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3677 CVE-2010-3680 CVE-2010-3681 CVE-2010-3682 CVE-2010-3833 CVE-2010-3834 CVE-2010-3835 CVE-2010-3836 CVE-2010-3837 CVE-2010-3838 CVE-2010-3840

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2010-3677

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) via a join query that uses a
  table with a unique SET column.

CVE-2010-3680

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by creating temporary tables
  while using InnoDB, which triggers an assertion failure.

CVE-2010-3681

  It was discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated users to cause
  a denial of service (mysqld daemon crash) by using the HANDLER interface
  and performing "alternate reads from two indexes on a table," which
  triggers an assertion failure.

CVE-2010-3682

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled use of EXPLAIN with
  certain queries.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3833

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled propagation during
  evaluation of arguments to extreme-value functions.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3834

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled materializing a derived
  table that required a temporary table for grouping.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3835

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain user-variable
  assignment expressions that are evaluated in a logical expression context.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3836

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled pre-evaluation of LIKE
  predicates during view preparation.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3837

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled using GROUP_CONCAT()
  and WITH ROLLUP together.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3838

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain queries using a
  mixed list of numeric and LONGBLOB arguments to the GREATEST() or
  LEAST() functions.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

CVE-2010-3840

  It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled improper WKB data
  passed to the PolyFromWKB() function.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.51a-24+lenny5

The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5.0 anymore.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
