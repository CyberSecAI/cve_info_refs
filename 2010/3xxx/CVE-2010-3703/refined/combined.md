How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- clamav
clamav was updated to version 0.96.5 to fix denial of service
problems (CVE-2010-4479, CVE-2010-4260, CVE-2010-4261)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- subversion
The SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit option allowed remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2010-3315).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- python
a race condition in the accept() implementation of smtpd.py could
lead to a denial of service (CVE-2010-3493).
integer overflows and insufficient size checks could crash the
audioop module (CVE-2010-2089, CVE-2010-1634).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit that to
modify or forge messages (CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020,
CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS version 2.4.9 fixes among other things two cross-site-scripting
and a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2010-2080, CVE-2010-3476,
CVE-2010-4071).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moonlight
Untrusted Moonlight apps could bypass constraints on methods which
potentially allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-4254).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.3
- OpenOffice\_org
Specially crafted ppt files could cause a heap based buffer overflow
in OpenOffice\_org Impress. Attackers could exploit that to crash
OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936).
The update also fixes numerous non-security bugs. Please refer to
the package changelog for details.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- kdenetwork4
Specially crafted metalink files allowed attackers to create files
outside the download directory (CVE-2010-1000)
The update also fixes ICQ login problems with kopete.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- zope
A race condition in zope allowed attackers to crash the server
(CVE-2010-3495).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could crash xpdf or potentially even
cause execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2010-3702, CVE-2010-3703,
CVE-2010-3704)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1
- gnutls
Support for RFC5746 TLS renegotiations was backported to defend
against man in the middle attacks (CVE-2009-3555).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- opera
opera 11.00 fixes among other things several security vulnerabilities.
Please refer opera's site for more information:

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
