Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2010-3703:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `PostScriptFunction` within the poppler library. Specifically, there was a use of an uninitialized pointer, which could lead to a crash or memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of an uninitialized pointer. If this pointer was controlled by a crafted PDF, it could lead to memory corruption, or even code execution via virtual method call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could cause a denial of service by crashing the application.
- Memory corruption could occur, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- In some scenarios, it may be possible to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user opening the crafted PDF file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted PDF documents. If a user or an automated system opens a malicious PDF file, the vulnerability can be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted PDF document that exploits the uninitialized pointer vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick a user or automated process into opening the malicious PDF document, potentially by email, web links, etc..

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was corrected in poppler git commit `bf2055088a`.
- The issue primarily affects recent versions of poppler after commit `b1d4efb082`
- This issue does not affect xpdf or other applications that only embed xpdf code, but rather is specific to the Poppler library.
- The fix involves ensuring the `stack` variable is properly initialized: `stack = NULL;`

- Multiple vendors like Ubuntu, Slackware, and SUSE released patches for this vulnerability
- Red Hat also addressed the vulnerability, with errata `RHSA-2010:0859`
- Secunia also made a security advisory about this vulnerability.
