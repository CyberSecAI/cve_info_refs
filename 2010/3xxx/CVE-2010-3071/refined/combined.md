```
Package: bip
Version: 0.8.2-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Unauthenticated users can easily cause a NULL pointer dereference in bip (bip is
listening at localhost:7778):

$ echo USER | telnet localhost 7778

<other window>

==25787== Process terminating with default action of signal 11 (SIGSEGV)
==25787==  Access not within mapped region at address 0x0
==25787==    at 0x11BE5C: bip_on_event (irc.c:2483)
==25787==    by 0x11BF4A: irc_main (irc.c:2554)
==25787==    by 0x113A97: main (bip.c:1316)

The NULL pointer dereference happens in this code:

    if (r == ERR_PROTOCOL) {
        mylog(LOG_ERROR, "[%s] Error in protocol, closing...",
                LINK(lc)->name);
        goto prot_err_lines;
    }

AFAIK this has been reported upstream. However, I haven't talked directly with
any bip developer about this so far.

Cheers,
Uli

Subject: CVE Request -- Bip -- Remote Dos (crash) by exchanging user credentials

Hello Steve, vendors,

   A denial of service flaw was found in the way Bip IRC Bouncer
exchanged user credentials by initiating the IRC protocol session.
A remote, unauthenticated user could send a specially crafted
connection request, leading to bip daemon crash (NULL pointer dereference)

References:
   [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=595409>
   [2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=630437>

Could you allocate CVE id for this one?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
