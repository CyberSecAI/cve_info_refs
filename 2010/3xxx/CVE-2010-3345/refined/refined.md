Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2010-3345:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles memory when accessing objects that have not been correctly initialized or have been deleted. This improper handling of memory can lead to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to incorrect object initialization or deletion within the browser's memory management.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- An attacker could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the system, enabling them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted web page.
- Attackers can host malicious content on compromised websites, websites that accept user content, or through malicious advertisements.
- Attackers would need to convince users to visit a malicious website, typically through phishing emails or malicious links in instant messages.
- It is also possible to embed malicious ActiveX controls in an application or Microsoft Office document, using the IE rendering engine to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or embed malicious content in another means that will be accessed by a user running a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website or to open a document containing the malicious code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for multiple versions of Internet Explorer.
- Microsoft released a security update to address this vulnerability as part of MS10-090.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin, and Microsoft was not aware of any active attacks exploiting the vulnerability at the time.
- Mitigations include running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003/2008 with Enhanced Security Configuration, and disabling/blocking ActiveX controls and Active Scripting.
- Workarounds involve disabling or prompting before running Active Scripting or using a user-defined style sheet to override website CSS.
