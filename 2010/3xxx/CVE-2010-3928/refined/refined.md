        "Improper input validation leading to escape sequence injection."

        "Malicious file containing escape sequences.",
         "The user must be convinced to take a standard action that does not feel harmful, such as viewing a file"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create or modify a file containing malicious escape sequences. The user must open or view this file.",
        "more_information": "This vulnerability is related to how RVM processes and displays data in the terminal, allowing an attacker to inject escape sequences through a maliciously crafted file. The user must be convinced to view the crafted file in order to trigger the vulnerability."

       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)."

      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create or modify a file containing malicious escape sequences. The user must open or view this file.",
         "more_information": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, which allows attackers to inject escape sequences into the terminal output through a malicious file. The severity of this is rated as medium with a CVSS v2 base score of 4.3."
