  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2010-3862",
    "summary": "JBoss Remoting Denial-Of-Service",
    "details": "The vulnerability is located in the org.jboss.remoting.transport.bisocket.BisocketServerInvoker$SecondaryServerSocketThread.run() method. This method contains the accept-loop for the bisocket control connection. After accepting a connection, the thread attempts to read an action code and a listener id from the connection. If the client sends no data, the thread blocks indefinitely in the read call, preventing any further connections from being accepted. This effectively causes a denial-of-service.",
    "affected_component": "JBoss Remoting",
    "root_cause": "The accept-loop thread directly reads from the newly created connection, blocking on the read call if no data is sent, preventing further connection attempts.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
      "Blocking thread"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can prevent new client connections to the bisocket control port, and also prevent JBossMessaging from sending messages to consumers. In some configurations, it could hang attempts to send message payloads, potentially requiring a server restart.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network connection"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker only needs the ability to connect to the bisocket control connection port (i.e. via telnet) and not send any data."
  },
  "patch_details": {
    "solution": "The fix involves offloading the processing of the newly created socket to a separate thread, thereby preventing the accept-loop thread from blocking on the read call. A thread pool is used to limit the number of threads created and a timeout value is set to prevent hanging of socket processing threads by withholding expected bytes.",

        "Remoting release 2.5.3.SP1",
