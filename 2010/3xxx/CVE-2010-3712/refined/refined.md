Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from inadequate filtering of multiple encoded entities in Joomla! versions prior to 1.5.21. This insufficient input sanitization allows for XSS attacks. Specifically, the query string parameters were not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. User-supplied input in URLs is not properly sanitized, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can create specially crafted URLs that, when visited by a victim, execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   **Session Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to the compromise of the currently logged-in user's session. This includes administrator sessions, allowing attackers to impersonate arbitrary users and perform actions within the administrative interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URLs:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted URLs. These URLs contain encoded malicious scripts within the query string parameters. The specific parameters and the methods of injection vary between the different Joomla! versions (1.5.20 and 1.6.0), but the underlying issue remains the lack of proper input sanitization.
    *   SEO enabled URLs
    *   SEO disabled URLs

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft malicious URLs.
*   **Ability to distribute malicious URLs:** Attackers need the ability to trick victims into clicking malicious URLs which can be done via phishing, social engineering, or other methods.
*  **No special access**: The attacker does not need any specific access to the server, the vulnerability is triggered through the browser by the user visiting the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was present in Joomla! 1.5.20 and all previous 1.5 releases. The same vulnerability was also found in Joomla! 1.6.0.
*   The issue in 1.5.20 was resolved in version 1.5.21.
*   The issue in 1.6.0 was resolved in version 1.6.1.
