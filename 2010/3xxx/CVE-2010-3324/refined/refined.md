{
  "CVE-2010-3324": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way that the SafeHTML function sanitizes HTML.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of HTML input by the SafeHTML function leading to cross-site scripting."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks against users of a site that is filtering HTML content via SafeHTML. An attacker could then potentially run scripts on behalf of the targeted site's users.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a target site using SafeHTML. Any web page on that site containing the malicious script can be a vector for XSS attacks. After the script is submitted, when a user visits a page with the malicious script it could be run in their security context"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to submit a specially crafted script using SafeHTML to a target site, and then convince a user to visit a page on that target site to execute the script."
