  "CVE-2010-3591": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability exists in Oracle Document Capture's ActiveX component (empop3.dll), specifically within the `DownloadSingleMessageToFile` method. This method is insecure and allows for arbitrary file deletion on the system.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `DownloadSingleMessageToFile` method in the `empop3.dll` ActiveX component lacks proper validation of the file path parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the system.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Insecure method usage",
        "Arbitrary file deletion"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the system by exploiting the insecure method.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious HTML page embedding the vulnerable ActiveX component and calling the vulnerable method can be delivered to the victim.",
        "Visiting the crafted HTML page will cause the arbitrary file deletion on the user's system."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML page containing the ActiveX component with the vulnerable `DownloadSingleMessageToFile` method, which then needs to be delivered to a victim. The victim must visit this malicious page using a web browser with ActiveX support."
    },
      "affected_products": [
       "Oracle Document Capture 10.1.3.4",
