Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-3731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `db2dasrrm` process of IBM DB2.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a request to the `com.ibm.db2.das.core.DasSysCmd` function.
- The username supplied in the request is copied to a fixed-length stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
- By sending a username string that is larger than the buffer, an overflow can occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow due to missing bounds check on username input.
- Lack of input validation in the `db2dasrrm` process when handling the `DasSysCmd` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- Full compromise of the affected system: If code execution is achieved, attackers may be able to gain full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: Remote attackers can send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable DB2 instance.
- Input: Malicious username string provided as part of the request to `com.ibm.db2.das.core.DasSysCmd`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access to the vulnerable IBM DB2 instance over the network.
- Ability to send specially crafted requests containing a long username string to the `db2dasrrm` service.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2010-06-30, and the advisory was publicly released on 2011-01-31.
- The vulnerability was present in IBM DB2 versions 9.1, 9.5 and 9.7 (specific fix pack versions are mentioned in the additional details).
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-11-035 and ZDI-CAN-775.
- The CVSS score is 9.0 with vector AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C
