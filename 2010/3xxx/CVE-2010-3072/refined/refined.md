**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-3072

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Squid proxy caching server internally processed NULL buffers within its string handling functions. Specifically, the `strcmp` and `strncmp` functions were not properly handling NULL or empty strings, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of NULL or empty strings within the `strcmp` and `strncmp` functions in Squid's string handling implementation.
- Failure to check for NULL pointers before dereferencing them, leading to a potential crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, trusted client could send a specially crafted request containing NULL or empty strings, causing the squid daemon to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.
- This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the proxy server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a network request sent to the Squid proxy server by a remote, trusted client.
- The specially crafted request contains a NULL or empty string that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the vulnerable string comparison functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a trusted client, implying that they have some form of access to interact with the Squid proxy server.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with specific crafted payloads containing NULL or empty strings to the vulnerable Squid instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Squid versions 3.0 up to 3.0.STABLE25, 3.1 up to 3.1.7, and 3.2 up to 3.2.0.1.
- The issue was fixed in Squid versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.0.2.
- Patches addressing the problem are available for Squid 3.0 and 3.1.
- A workaround for the known active 0-day trigger involves setting the `ignore_expect_100` squid.conf option to "off" or building Squid with the `--disable-http-violations` flag.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Phil Oester.
