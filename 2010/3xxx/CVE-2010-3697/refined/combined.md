How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <20101001162950.GP1955@redhat.com>
Date: Fri, 1 Oct 2010 10:29:50 -0600
From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: freeradius

Requesting CVE names for two flaws fix in freeradius 2.1.10:

DoS via certain DHCP requests
[1] <https://bugs.freeradius.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=77>
[2] <http://secunia.com/advisories/41621>
[3] <http://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/commit/4dc7800b866f889a1247685bbaa6dd4238a56279>
[4] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=639390>

crash when processing requests queued for more than 30 seconds
[1] <https://bugs.freeradius.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35>
[2] <http://secunia.com/advisories/41621>
[3] <http://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/commit/ff94dd35673bba1476594299d31ce8293b8bd223>
[4] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=639397>

Both issues only affect 2.1.x (1.1.x does not have the affected files or
functions).  It looks as though the first issue only affected 2.1.9; I'm
not yet sure if or how far the second issue may go back.

Could two CVE names be assigned to this issue please?

Thanks!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=639397#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-01 16:11:03 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that an error when processing requests queued for more than 30 seconds in src/main/event.c could be exploited to cause the process to crash by sending a large number of requests for an extended period of time.  This flaw seems to only affect 2.1.x and was fixed [3] in 2.1.10.  [1] <https://bugs.freeradius.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=35> [2] <http://secunia.com/advisories/41621> [3] <http://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/commit/ff94dd35673bba1476594299d31ce8293b8bd223>  The offending file (event.c), nor the affected function (wait_for_child_to_die()) are not present in the version of freeradius as provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (1.1.3).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=639397#c2)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-01 21:53:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned the name [CVE-2010-3697](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3697).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=639397#c3)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-01 21:59:08 UTC  ``` Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 639490](show_bug.cgi?id=639490 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2010-3696 CVE-2010-3697 freeradius various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=639397#c4)  aland    2010-10-03 16:45:32 UTC  ``` It would help to talk to the vendor before requesting a CVE, and filing a security issue.    1) it is exploitable *only* by known clients.      i.e. by people within the trust network    2) you have to send 10's of millions of packets to see it      on some systems I've sent *billions* of packets, and not seen it.    3) the system has to log to a database    4) which is down for extended periods of time.  The net effect is that "if your RADIUS server is unresponsive for extended periods, there's an issue which can make it unresponsive"  As a result, the issue is annoying, but minor.  It is *not* externally exploitable, and has *no* security impact.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=639397#c5)  Vincent Danen    2010-11-25 17:51:23 UTC  ``` I am inclined to agree with Alan here.  If the RADIUS server is down already, it isn't really a denial of service since the service is already unavailable.  As a result, this is not something we intend to fix as it has no security impact.  Statement:  Red Hat does not consider this to a security issue.  In order for the crash condition to be observed, the RADIUS server must already be unresponsive for extended periods of time, the net result of which is that you cannot DoS an already-unresponsive server.  Other specialized conditions are required as well, that make an attack using this flaw unviable.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=639397#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-03 16:49:46 UTC  ``` Upstream has made the following public dispute to this flaw (<http://freeradius.org/security.html>):  2010.10.01 [CVE-2010-3697](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3697) - This issue was filed without consulting with us, and we do not agree with the assessment.  The correct summary is that if the database is down for a long time and the server is unresponsive, there are corner cases where known clients (not attackers) sending large amounts of data can cause the server to crash.  In normal operation, when the server stops responding to packets (i.e. because the database is down), the NAS will stop sending it packets, and will fail over to another server. In addition, our tests indicate that this issue occurs only when the database is down for extended periods of time, and the server receives many millions of packets during that time. i.e. the problem will not occur in most deployments.  We recommend that deployments monitor their database and RADIUS server. If the database is down for extended periods, the root cause should be investigated and corrected. When FreeRADIUS is configured to depend on a database, database outages will naturally cause service outages for the RADIUS server. People who want a fix to this issue can upgrade to the latest version of the server.   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Do not delete "old" requests until they are free.

```
If the request is in the queue for 30+ seconds, do NOT delete it.
Instead, mark it as "STOP PROCESSING", and do "wait_for_child_to_die",
which waits for a child thread to pick it up, and acknowledge that it's
done.  Once it's marked done, we can finally clean it up.

This may be the underlying issue behind bug [FreeRADIUS#35](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/pull/35)
```
