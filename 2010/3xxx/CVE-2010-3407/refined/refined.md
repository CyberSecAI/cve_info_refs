{
  "CVE-2010-3407": {
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in IBM Lotus Domino versions 8.0 and 8.5 when handling iCalendar email addresses. Specifically, the nrouter.exe service doesn't perform sufficient bounds checking when copying the MAILTO header contents of a calendar request into a fixed-size stack buffer using `Cstrcpy`. An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted malicious email to the Lotus Domino SMTP server with an overly long email address. This allows for arbitrary code execution in the context of the nrouter process.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient bounds checking in the `MailCheck821Address` function before performing a string copy (`Cstrcpy`) operation. This occurs when handling iCalendar email addresses within the MAILTO header.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to lack of bounds checking during string copy operations."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code on systems running vulnerable IBM Lotus Domino servers in the context of the `nrouter.exe` process.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted email containing an iCalendar object with a long email address in the MAILTO header to a vulnerable Lotus Domino SMTP server.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a Lotus Domino server and know a valid mailbox email address. No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability."
