{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing `detach()` implementation in `XMLDocumentParser` which leads to a use-after-free condition. The parser retains a reference to a Document object on its node stack even after the document has been deleted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Missing resource management"
    ],
    "impact": "Visiting a specially crafted webpage can cause the browser to crash and potentially execute arbitrary code due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage",
        "Exploitation of the vulnerability through rendering of SVG fonts which are not properly decoded"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host or inject a malicious webpage with a specific crafted SVG font, which is not properly decoded, to trigger the vulnerability when the browser attempts to render it.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability was triggered during the processing of a malformed SVG font file which was incorrectly declared in the CSS via the format('svg') declaration and resulted in a crash when the XML parser tried to access a freed `Document` object. The `CachedFont::ensureSVGFontData` method was identified as the location of the incorrect logic that lead to the crash."
