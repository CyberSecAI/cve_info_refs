1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

if (m\_currentNode && m\_currentNode != document())
m\_currentNode->deref();
m\_currentNode is a Document, but DocumentParser::m\_document is null, so we're wrongly trying to deref the document.
Could it be an HTML5 parser related change that DocumentParser::m\_document is null here?

[Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=44533#c3)
2010-08-24 14:14:34 PDT

The ASSERT/crash is that the Document is already being deleted and the XMLDocumentParser still has a reference to it on its node stack.
This may have been caused by changes to fragment parsing. Seems we should have cleared the node stack earlier.
I'm not sure how this worked before.

[Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=44533#c4)
2010-08-24 14:20:27 PDT

I don't think it's "safe" in this case, to blast away the Document before telling the XMLDocumentParser we're done.
I believe the wrong code is bool CachedFont::ensureSVGFontData().
bool CachedFont::ensureSVGFontData()
{
ASSERT(m\_isSVGFont);
if (!m\_externalSVGDocument && !errorOccurred() && !isLoading() && m\_data) {
m\_externalSVGDocument = SVGDocument::create(0, KURL());
m\_externalSVGDocument->open();
RefPtr<TextResourceDecoder> decoder = TextResourceDecoder::create("application/xml");
m\_externalSVGDocument->write(decoder->decode(m\_data->data(), m\_data->size()));
m\_externalSVGDocument->write(decoder->flush());
if (decoder->sawError()) {
m\_externalSVGDocument.clear();
return 0;
}
m\_externalSVGDocument->finishParsing();
m\_externalSVGDocument->close();
}
We should move the decoding up to before opening the document, or we should let the parse finish and only abort on decoding error after the parse is done.
I'm not sure what the old parser was doing here, but it's possible it was doing Bad Things™.

On second thought, I think the root cause here is that XMLDocumentParser needs a detach() implementation, which should do things like clearing the node stack at that time.

This looks good. Don't we want a test case for the original crash though?

I'm not averse to adding one. The case encountered by the orignal crash is now transformed to be covered by a whole bunch of Layout Tests. I'll see if I can whip up an SVG font with invalid decoding however.

I believe <http://weblab.ab-c.nl/css/font/abc.aspx> is the font in question. It's a truetype file, but maybe somehow it's heading down the SVG font path?

2010-08-24 17:04:48 PDT

The page is explicitly telling WebKit it's an SVG font when it isn't:
<http://weblab.ab-c.nl/css/weblab.css>:
@font-face {font-family: 'abc'; src: url('font/abc.aspx#webfont6R4Fh5cD') format('svg'), url('font/abc.aspx')}
So a test case should be easy to create.

#### Safari 5.1 and Safari 5.0.6

* **CFNetwork**

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: In certain situations, Safari may treat a file as HTML, even if it is served with the 'text/plain' content type. This may lead to a cross-site scripting attack on sites that allow untrusted users to post text files. This issue is addressed through improved handling of 'text/plain' content.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2010-1420 : Hidetake Jo working with Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR), Neal Poole of Matasano Security

* **CFNetwork**

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

  Impact: Authenticating to a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: The NTLM authentication protocol is susceptible to a replay attack referred to as credential reflection. Authenticating to a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution. To mitigate this issue, Safari has been updated to utilize protection mechanisms recently added to Windows. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems.

  CVE-ID
