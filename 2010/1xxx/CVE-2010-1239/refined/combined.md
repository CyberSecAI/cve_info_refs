### Escape From PDF

Filed under: [Hacking](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/hacking/),[PDF](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/pdf/) ‚Äî Didier Stevens @ 19:46

This is a special PDF hack: I managed to make a PoC PDF to execute an embedded executable without exploiting any vulnerability!

I use a launch action triggered by the opening of my PoC PDF. With Adobe Reader, the user gets a warning asking for approval to launch the action, but I can (partially) control the message displayed by the dialog. Foxit Reader displays no warning at all, the action gets executed without user interaction.

PDF viewers like Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader don‚Äôt allow embedded executables (like binaries and scripts) to be extracted and executed:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-201757.png?w=610&h=314 "20100329-201757")

But I found another way to launch a command (/Launch /Action), and ultimately run an executable I embedded using a special technique. With Adobe Reader, a launch action needs to be approved by the user:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-201213.png?w=478&h=262 "20100329-201213")

But I can partially control the message displayed by this dialog box:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-211248.png?w=478&h=262 "20100329-211248")

I can use this to social-engineer users to ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù the file:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-211313.png?w=478&h=262 "20100329-211313")

Do you believe this could this mislead some of your users? Or maybe you can come up with a better message to fool your users.

With Foxit Reader, no warning is displayed:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-211310.png?w=457&h=385 "20100329-211310")

I‚Äôm not publishing my PoC PDF yet, but you can download a PDF that will just launch cmd.exe [here](http://didierstevens.com/files/data/launch-action-cmd.zip). Use it to test your PDF reader.

With Adobe Reader, the only thing preventing execution is a warning. Disabling JavaScript will not prevent this (I don‚Äôt use JavaScript in my PoC PDF), and patching Adobe Reader isn‚Äôt possible (I‚Äôm not exploiting a vulnerability, just being creative with the PDF language specs).

I shared my PoC with Adobe‚Äôs PSIRT. Maybe they will come up with a solution to prevent this, should they consider that the protection offered by the warning dialog is not sufficient. BTW, [preventing Adobe Reader from creating new processes](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2009/10/05/preventing-applications-from-starting-malicious-applications/) blocks this trick.

In this case, Foxit Reader is probably worse than Adobe Reader, because no warning gets displayed to prevent the launch action. My PoC PDF requires some changes for Foxit Reader, because ultimately, the executable doesn‚Äôt run. But that‚Äôs probably due to some variation in the PDF language supported by Foxit Reader.

Tested with Adobe Reader 9.3.1 on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7.

1. PDF-XChange Viewer (2.0 Build 44) seems to be safe. It displays a clear (not faked) warning. And when I confirm with ‚Äúyes‚Äù I get an error. Nothing else happens.

3. @Christoph Thanks for testing. FYI: I don‚Äôt manipulate the warning dialog in the PDF I offer for download.

5. Nice work on the messing with the warning box. The workaround to block acrobat blocking process was interesting too ‚Äì it seems crazy that ‚Äúenhanced security‚Äù mode in acrobat doesn‚Äôt disable the /launch action.

   FYI a cross reader/os version (albeit without message box bit) has been published a while ago from Fred Raynal:

   /OpenAction <<

   /F <>

   /S /Launch

   >>

   Also available here: <http://seclabs.org/fred/docs/sstic09/samples/actions/launch/calc.pdf>

   This is the interesting bit anyways:

   /DOS (C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\calc.exe)

9. Nice!

   The lack of user confirmation in Foxit makes me remember a somewhat similar vulnerability I‚Äôve reported a year ago in Foxit Reader: it didn‚Äôt require user confirmation before launching an executable via the ‚ÄúOpen/Execute a file‚Äù action. (Just local executables, no arbitrary embedded exes at that time).

   <http://www.coresecurity.com/content/foxit-reader-vulnerabilities>

   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2009-0836>

   Seems like the flaw remained alive somewhere!

11. In the case of foxit, I also did notice it executes without warning, however it doesn‚Äôt seem posible to pass parameters to whatever command you launch. If that is the case it sorts of renders the vulnerability useless, what do you think?

13. Hi,

    This as been available in metasploit for months now:

    <http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/repository/revisions/8379/changes/modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/adobe_pdf_embedded_exe.rb>

    You can also name the exe acroread.exe to make it less suspicious

17. @racinedestyle No, I had a look at the Ruby code, my PoC is different. Although we both use a launch action for cmd.exe, I don‚Äôt use JavaScript, embedding and extracting is totally different, and I control the content of the dialog box.

    But I‚Äôve contacted Colin with details of my PoC.

19. Nice post and PoC, congrats Didier!

    From my tests with ‚Äúlaunch\_action\_cmd.pdf‚Äù, PDF-XChange Viewer under Windows7 shows a legit warning message:

    ‚ÄúThe application ‚Äú%1‚Ä≥ is set to be launched by this PDF file.

    The file may contain program, macros or viruses that may potentially harm your computer.

    Only open if you are sure it is safe.‚Äù

    Also once accepted the message, tries to open the wrong path for cmd.exe and fails. The PATH used I suppose is the current PATH of the PDF file.

21. I just checked with Sumatra PDF Reader (using the Portable version from portableapps.com), and it simply ignores the command to open the cmd.exe. I get the page, but no window. üôÇ

35. Hi,

    a kind of this foxit exploit is already within metasploit (I guess the one Francisco mentioned). I used this in a PoC to ‚Äúrcp‚Äù a reverse\_shell.exe into the users startup folder. Worked like a charm.

    The last time I used it was in late December 09. I‚Äôve no idea if it is fixed already.

135. [‚Ä¶] Didier Stevens found the vulnerability/ design flaw. Essentially it allows you to include executable files within a .pdf file, and auto-execute them as soon as the PDF is viewed! What‚Äôs more is that it doesn‚Äôt require javascript to be enabled. The PDF format does not allow you to embed binaries, but there is a ‚ÄòLaunch Action‚Äô which can launch a command, Didier has manipulated this to execute embedded data and he has even managed to manipulate the user warning shown below to display a custom message.

209. @lurk I believe Foxit Reader 1.3 has no support for Launch Actions. So it just ignores it; That‚Äôs what all PDF readers do (AFAIK): if they encounter an unknown keyword during the parsing process, they just ignore it. This way, they can still render documents with a higher PDF language version number than the one the reader is supporting.

Die Schwachstelle wurde von Didier Stevens dem Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) gemeldet. Allerdings wird es hier nicht ein einfach Patch tun, da es sich um eine PDF-Spezifikation handelt und nicht um eine Sicheheitsl√ºcke in den entsprechenden PDF-Viewern. [‚Ä¶]

243. All I want is a PDF reader that reads all PDF files, prints some out, and DOES NOT have Javascript or launching executable code or any of that OBVIOUS exploitable stuff. Is it just Sumatra that is out there? And that doesn‚Äôt even display many PDF files?

     This is why PDF as a format needs to be abandoned.

345. Folks in my LJ have pointed out that, of course, the embedded command in the text file is, specifically, a Windows command. Of course it‚Äôs not going to work in Mac or Linux.

     The question is, if the function call is replaced by the appropriate ‚ÄòNix command, will it work? And if it doesn‚Äôt work, is that due to ‚Äúsuperior OS security‚Äù, or just the erratic feature support that us Linux users all bitch about when it interferes with things we want to do, and gloat about when it interferes with potential hazards?

     I lack the ‚ÄòFu to make the appropriate test files myself; I‚Äôm going to try the version linked in the comments above.

     /F (cmd.exe)(/params)

     /F (cmd.exe) /params

     didnt work.

     And this does not open aterm or gimp or anything on linux. Adobe throws the file exec warning what I OK down then nothing happens (Adobe reader 9.1.2).

351. The test file that is supposed to run cmd.exe does not function correctly when it is opened with Acrobat reader 6.02 running on windows 98. I get this error: There was an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be repaired.

     Win-98 does not have cmd.exe. I copied calc.exe to cmd.exe but still got the same error. Conclusion: Windows 98 continues to be largely invulnerable to most malware, viruses, trojans, etc.

367. I‚Äôv tried posting this several times since 3/30, but it hasn‚Äôt gone through. Going to try it again, this time by obfuscating the URLs:

     Actions (including Launch) have been in the PDF spec since 1.1 (1996).

     There are many similar examples of this, including:

     You can make other PDF viewers (such as Nuance and PDF-XChange Viewer ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù to this by including the full path (as the spec describes) in a manner that Paul mentions in his 2nd post. I.e., include 4 backslashes for every backslash in the path.

369. ‚ÄúI managed to make a PoC PDF to execute an embedded executable without exploiting any vulnerability!‚Äù

     Technically, no. You did have to exploit two vulnerabilities:

     1. The fact that the wording of a security alert can be altered to hide what‚Äôs actually being opened by the PDF IS a vulnerability (of the application I believe, unless the PDF spec REQUIRES you to put that text before/instead of the actual URI in any warning message, in which case it‚Äôs a vulnerability baked into the specification.)

     2. While not a vulnerability in the application or the spec, there is still the ultimate vulnerability behind the keyboard/mouse that decides to open the file. üòõ

     Eliminate the first vulnerability, and the risk posed by the second vulnerability decreases (but probably not enough‚Ä¶ üòâ

433. Didier-

     Thank you for this entry.

     On downloading PDFs from unknown sources, it got me to wondering, aside from scanning the documents, what other easy precautions non-technical users can take.

     1. First, what is PoC? A search at acronymfinder.com returned nothing relevant.

     2. If I understand you correctly, as a safety precaution, you recommend UNCHECKING ‚ÄúEnable Acrobat JavaScript‚Äù in Adobe Acrobat under Preferences ‚Äì> JavaScript, and UNCHECKING ‚ÄúAllow documents to open other files and launch other applications‚Äù under Preferences ‚Äì> Trust Manager, as default settings, correct?

     3. Are there other Preference settings you recommend in Acrobat to further increase security against malware? Or any other precautions with respect to PDFs?

     4. Also, with JavaScript disabled, is there an obvious notification in Acrobat if it should be required, in much the same fashion as Firefox‚Äôs NoScript extension (which I use).

     Sorry for the basic questions. Thank you, MK Ross

435. I have literally been waiting for people to wake up and speak out about this adobe hack, infact there are some that run without you doing anything other than going to a site. It hooks right into your AcroRd32.exe and give out some nice maleware. That whole windows security spoof where it would replace your security center with a fake one where all the links would send you to some website. Anyways i hope they get a handle on it.

449. You can hex-edit the .pdf file and substitute the (cmd.exe) with another 3-letter .EXE (as long as the file is in the system path). Hex-editing might allow this exploit to launch a file under Linux or a Mac OS. I use Foxit Reader v3.1.4.1125 ‚Äì the exploit worked without warning me.

     If you use a process blocker program (I use ProcessGuard v3.500), it will stop the execution of the external program.

469. Does anyone know if a signature or regex could be created that looks for the /OpenAction within a PDF file? Is there really any reason that a valid PDF file should be using the /OpenAction switch? I would like to implement an IDS block for this type of signature if it won‚Äôt cause any problems with valid PDFs.

475. Thanks Didier, PDFiD is a nice tool. However that still leaves the question if an IPS signature that blocks any packets that match the signature/regex ‚Äú/OpenAction‚Äù, would it block a lot of perfectly valid PDFs? My plan is to implement this block on an enterprise webproxy, and email gateways. After reading your post on Disarming a PDF file it seems like adding /AA, /JS and /JavaScript to the list may also be a good idea.

     I put in the same folder, the py files and calc.exe. I used it in this way:

     make-pdf-embedded.py -a calc.exe test.pdf

     The pdf is created but when I run it, it is only written ‚ÄúThis files embeds calc.exe‚Äù and nothing happened. No warning message even I use the -b and -m option.

     But when I download your example file ‚Äúhttp://didierstevens.com/files/data/launch-action-cmd.zip‚Äù, it works pretty well, I have the warning and the cmd window opened.

579. I modified Didier‚Äôs sample pdf like so:

     67 /Type /Action

     68 /S /Launch

     69 /Mac

     70

     73 >>

     74 endobj

     Tried above on Mac OS X 10.6.7 and Adobe Reader 10.0.3 and Preview 5.0.3 and it didn‚Äôt work. In Adobe Reader it threw up a window that said it couldn‚Äôt open a file. In Preview it didn‚Äôt do anything.

587. In the case of foxit, I also did notice it executes without warning, however it doesn‚Äôt seem posible to pass parameters to whatever command you launch. If that is the case it sorts of renders the vulnerability useless, what do you think?

595. @Anonymous You can‚Äôt, because you are using a version where Adobe disabled this feature after I‚Äôve reported it to them. You need to use a version released before I blogged this.

597. This may seem like an idiotic question but how can i download a version of adobe reader that this will work with? ![:/](https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/uneasy.svg)

603. So if I use Adobe Reader 9.3.1 and Windows 7 this will still work?

605. I have got Adober Reader 9.3.1 but it wont install, it throws up an error message so does that mean this exploit is now technically impossible because it seems Adobe or Windows wont allow Adobe 9.3.1 to be installed anywhere

     Comment by Anon ‚Äî Friday 27 January 2012 @ [0:48](#comment-50081)
607. No, it does not. Windows does not prevent you from installing vulnerable apps.

609. Calc.pdf is missing a xref entry for the font object, yet it is referenced elsewhere within the document. It never ceases to amaze me how lenient some readers are, and how that leniency sometimes affects the viability of malware.

     Sorry for the late response, I just recently started using your pdf-parser.py tool and reading your posts regarding the PDF format.

611. Oops, edit to my last.

     It wasn‚Äôt your calc.pdf, it was the launch-action-cmd.pdf offered by a commenter.

**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to access the resources or execute malicious actions under users‚Äô systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers. | * J√∂rn Henkel |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could deliver incorrect signature verification information when handling certain signed XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to manipulate document content and deceive users into trusting and signing the manipulated documents. This occurs as the application improperly ignores the changes to the ‚Äú/NeedsRendering‚Äù key or ‚ÄúTextField‚Äù field when verifying the XFA documents. | * J√∂rn Henkel |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents with the ‚Äúapp.openDoc‚Äù function, certain PDF files with the ‚Äò‚ÄôLaunchAction‚Äù function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data. This occurs as the application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the ‚Äúapp.openDoc‚Äù/‚ÄúLaunchAction‚Äù functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users. | * J√∂rn Henkel * Haifei Li of EXPMON |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs due to the use of a wild pointer or null pointer without proper validation. (CVE-2024-12751, CVE-2024-12752, CVE-2024-49576, CVE-2024-47810) | * Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * KPC of Cisco Talos |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a DLL Hijacking vulnerability, which attackers could exploit to execute malicious actions. This occurs as the application fails to specify the secure search path when loading edputil.dll. | * Kim Dong Yeop (kdy) |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Privilege Escalation vulnerability due to the lack of proper validation when performing an update or installing a plugin. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM by loading malicious DLLs, calling an outdated version of the updater, or creating a junction to write an arbitrary file with full privileges. (CVE-2024-12753) | * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * Sascha Meyer from GAI NetConsult GmbH |

**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability during the deactivation or uninstallation if the application is reinstalled without prior uninstallation, which attackers could exploit to execute malicious actions. This occurs due to the inadequate permission setting for the ‚Äú/usr/local/share/foxit‚Äù folder used during the installation so that low-privilege attackers can easily tamper with the script files in the directory. | * Tomas Kabrt |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain checkbox field objects or AcroForms, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs as the application uses a wild pointer or an object that has been freed without proper validation, or fails to properly synchronize the annotation items when handling the Reply Note of an annotation using JavaScript.

| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain checkbox field objects, Doc objects, Annotation objects, or AcroForms, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code or disclose information. This occurs as the application uses a wild pointer or an object that has been freed without proper validation, fails to properly synchronize the annotation items when handling the Reply Note of an annotation using JavaScript, or fails to correctly update the font cache after deleting a page. (CVE-2024-28888, CVE-2024-7722, CVE-2024-7723, CVE-2024-7724, CVE-2024-7725, CVE-2024-9243, CVE-2024-9246, CVE-2024-9250, CVE-2024-9252, CVE-2024-9253, CVE-2024-9251, CVE-2024-9254, CVE-2024-9255, CVE-2024-9256) | * KPC of Cisco Talos * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability when performing an update or installing a plugin, which attackers could exploit to delete arbitrary files or execute arbitrary code so as to carry out privilege escalation attacks. This occurs due to the incorrect permission assignment on the resources used by the update service, improper signature validation and incomplete certificate check for the updater, weak randomness setting for the name of the temporary folder during a plugin installation, or improper DLL loading without using the built-in manifest file.

| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free, Out-of-Bounds Read, or Type Confusion vulnerability and crash when handling certain Doc, Graphic, Signature, Bookmark, or 3D annotation objects, which could be exploited by attackers to execute remote code or disclose information. This occurs due to the use of null pointer, wild pointer, or object that has been deleted or freed without proper validation. (CVE-2023-51549, CVE-2023-51550, CVE-2023-51552, CVE-2023-51554, CVE-2023-51553, CVE-2023-32616, CVE-2023-41257, CVE-2023-38573, CVE-2023-51555, CVE-2023-51556, CVE-2023-51557, CVE-2023-51558, CVE-2023-51559, CVE-2023-51551, CVE-2023-51562) | * XP from ZGCLab * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * Kamlapati Choubey of Cisco Talos * Aleksandar Nikolic and KPC of Cisco Talos |

| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Type Confusion Memory Corruption or Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash due to the lack of proper validation when an incorrect argument was passed to the *app.media.openPlayer* function defined in PDF JavaScript API (CVE-2020-13547). | Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash when executing certain JavaScript in a PDF file. This occurs due to the access or use of pointer or object that has been removed after calling certain JavaScript functions (CVE-2020-13548/CVE-2020-13557/CVE-2020-13560/CVE-2020-13570). | Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Denial of Service vulnerability and crash when opening certain PDF files that contained illegal value in the */Size* entry of the Trail dictionary. This occurs due to the array overflow as the illegal value in the */Size* entry causes an error in initializing the array size for storing the compression object streams, and an object number which is larger than the initialization value is used as the array index while parsing the cross-reference streams (CVE-2020-28203). | Sanjeev Das (IBM Research) |

| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when executing JavaScript in certain AcroForm. This occurs due to the use of *Opt* object after it has been deleted by calling *Field::ClearItems* method while executing *Field::DeleteOptions* method. | Hung Tien Tran @hungtt28 |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Write/Read Access Violation vulnerability and crash. This occurs due to the exception thrown by the V8 JavaScript engine, which is resulted from the failure to properly handle the situation where the Index returned during the allocation of thread local storage by *TslAlloc* function exceeds the limits acceptable by the V8 JavaScript engine. | John Stigerwalt |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Null Pointer Access/Dereference vulnerability and crash when opening certain specially crafted PDF. This occurs due to the access or reference of the null pointer without proper validation (CNVD-C-2020-169904/CNVD-C-2020-186241/CNVD-C-2020-186245). | John Stigerwalt Nafiez, Fakhrie and Yeh of TomatoDuck Fuzzing Group China National Vulnerability Database |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash when parsing certain JPEG2000 images. This occurs because the application fails to release memory correctly based on the memory block information (CVE-2020-17410). | Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability and crash.

| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Out-of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution vulnerability when parsing certain JPEG2000 images due to the incorrect read and write of memory at invalid address (CVE-2020-17416). | Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Remote Code Execution vulnerability during installation. This occurs as the application does not use the absolute path to find taskkill.exe but firstly finds and executes the one in the current working directory. | Dhiraj Mishra (@RandomDhiraj) |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free Information Disclosure or Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash. This occurs due to the use of */V* item which is deleted after being interpreted as the action executed during validation when it exists in both *Additional Action* and *Field* dictionaries but shares different interpretations (CNVD-C-2020-169907). | China National Vulnerability Database |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Universal Signature Forgery vulnerability and deliver incorrect validation results when validating digital signatures in certain PDF files. This occurs as the application fails to perform cryptographic validation of signatures correctly, which could be exploited by attackers to forge arbitrary signatures on arbitrary files and deceive the validator. | Matthias Valvekens |

**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to ActiveX not having a security permission control, which may allow JavaScript, LauchURL actions and Links to execute binary files/programs without prompting user for consent. (CVE-2018-19418/CVE-2018-19445/CVE-2018-19450/ CVE-2018-19451). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Illegally Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to ActiveX not having a security permission control, which may allow JavaScript and exportAsFDF to write any type of files to any location without the user's consent (CVE-2018-19446/ CVE-2018-19449). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to string1 URI Parsing Stack Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to lack of a maximum length limit for the URL where a long URL string will cause stack overflow when parsing (CVE-2018-19447). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs when a javascript command is triggered by a mouse enter action or a focus lost which deletes the current annotation, and causes it to reference the released memory (CVE-2018-19452/ CVE-2018-19444). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Uninitialized Object Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to the fact that the timer does not end when the form loses focus, which causes subsequent code to reference uninitialized objects (CVE-2018-19448). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |

However, the problems go beyond one specific PDF reader brand.Have you ever looked at the **specifications for the PDF file format**? You can [download them from here](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf) (PDF). They're 756 pages long. For real.There's some crazy stuff in the PDF specs.Take a look at these.PDF specsYou can embed movies and songs. Into a PDF file. What?PDF specsPDF files can contain 3D objects, complete with embedded JavaScript? Who comes up with these things?PDF specsPDFs can have forms. That's fine. But why do we need functionality where such forms can submit the data you input directly to a server somewhere on the net?PDF specsThere's a function within PDF specs to launch executables. Or to run JavaScript. Why do we need these things?With specs like these, it's no wonder it takes ages for Adobe Reader to boot up and load all the plugins.It's no wonder there are regular security problems with PDF readers in general.The perfect example is the "[Escape from PDF](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2010/03/29/escape-from-pdf/)" demo from Didier Stevens' blog.Users of **Foxit Reader**: try opening Didier's [demo PDF file](https://didierstevens.com/files/data/launch-action-cmd.zip). After opening, it will run CMD.EXE on your system; no questions asked. And this is a legitimate PDF file which uses no exploits.One way to reduce your risk is not to download PDF files from the web to your machine at all. Instead of opening the files on your local machine, you can open them remotely in viewers like Google Docs. This process can be made completely automatic with plugins like [gPDF](https://blog.arpitnext.com/gpdf) (for Chrome/Opera/Firefox/Iron). Do note that it will only work with PDF files you access in the public web.Otherwise, our guidance would be to use a PDF reader that's as unpopular as possible. The less users a product has, the less attacks it will attract.**Updated to add**: A press representative of Foxit software sent us a message via our weblog@ address. Foxit is working on an update/fix for their reader. See this [post's comments](https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/comments?PostID=00001923) for more details. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to access the resources or execute malicious actions under users‚Äô systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers. | * J√∂rn Henkel |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could deliver incorrect signature verification information when handling certain signed XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to manipulate document content and deceive users into trusting and signing the manipulated documents. This occurs as the application improperly ignores the changes to the ‚Äú/NeedsRendering‚Äù key or ‚ÄúTextField‚Äù field when verifying the XFA documents. | * J√∂rn Henkel |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents with the ‚Äúapp.openDoc‚Äù function, certain PDF files with the ‚Äò‚ÄôLaunchAction‚Äù function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data. This occurs as the application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the ‚Äúapp.openDoc‚Äù/‚ÄúLaunchAction‚Äù functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users. | * J√∂rn Henkel * Haifei Li of EXPMON |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs due to the use of a wild pointer or null pointer without proper validation. (CVE-2024-12751, CVE-2024-12752, CVE-2024-49576, CVE-2024-47810) | * Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * KPC of Cisco Talos |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a DLL Hijacking vulnerability, which attackers could exploit to execute malicious actions. This occurs as the application fails to specify the secure search path when loading edputil.dll. | * Kim Dong Yeop (kdy) |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Privilege Escalation vulnerability due to the lack of proper validation when performing an update or installing a plugin. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM by loading malicious DLLs, calling an outdated version of the updater, or creating a junction to write an arbitrary file with full privileges. (CVE-2024-12753) | * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * Sascha Meyer from GAI NetConsult GmbH |

**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability during the deactivation or uninstallation if the application is reinstalled without prior uninstallation, which attackers could exploit to execute malicious actions. This occurs due to the inadequate permission setting for the ‚Äú/usr/local/share/foxit‚Äù folder used during the installation so that low-privilege attackers can easily tamper with the script files in the directory. | * Tomas Kabrt |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain checkbox field objects or AcroForms, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs as the application uses a wild pointer or an object that has been freed without proper validation, or fails to properly synchronize the annotation items when handling the Reply Note of an annotation using JavaScript. (CVE-2024-28888, CVE-2024-7725, CVE-2024-9254) | * KPC of Cisco Talos * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |

| --- | --- |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain checkbox field objects, Doc objects, Annotation objects, or AcroForms, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code or disclose information. This occurs as the application uses a wild pointer or an object that has been freed without proper validation, fails to properly synchronize the annotation items when handling the Reply Note of an annotation using JavaScript, or fails to correctly update the font cache after deleting a page. (CVE-2024-28888, CVE-2024-7722, CVE-2024-7723, CVE-2024-7724, CVE-2024-7725, CVE-2024-9243, CVE-2024-9246, CVE-2024-9250, CVE-2024-9252, CVE-2024-9253, CVE-2024-9251, CVE-2024-9254, CVE-2024-9255, CVE-2024-9256) | * KPC of Cisco Talos * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative * Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability when performing an update or installing a plugin, which attackers could exploit to delete arbitrary files or execute arbitrary code so as to carry out privilege escalation attacks. This occurs due to the incorrect permission assignment on the resources used by the update service, improper signature validation and incomplete certificate check for the updater, weak randomness setting for the name of the temporary folder during a plugin installation, or improper DLL loading without using the built-in manifest file.

| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Out-of-Bounds Read/Write vulnerability and crash when parsing certain PDF files or handling certain Annotation objects, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code. This occurs as the application reads or writes data beyond the boundaries of an allocated object or buffer. (CVE-2024-9247, CVE-2024-9249, CVE-2024-9248) | * Anonymous working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a Side-Loading vulnerability when performing an update, which attackers could exploit to run malicious payloads by replacing the update file with a malicious one. This occurs as the application fails to validate the integrity of the updater when running the update service. (CVE-2024-41605) | * Jukka Juntunen / Hypervisio Oy |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability and crash when scrolling certain PDF files with an abnormal *StructTreeRoot* dictionary entry, which attackers could exploit to launch a Denial of Service attack. This occurs due to the use of a null pointer without proper validation. | * Haifei Li of EXPMON |

| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Uninitialized Object Information Disclosure vulnerability and crash. This occurs as the application directly transforms the PDF Object as PDF Stream for further actions without proper validation when verifying the information in a crafted XObject (CVE-2020-11493). | Steven Seeley of Qihoo 360 Vulcan Team |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Out-of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure vulnerability and crash. This occurs due to the application mistakenly uses the index of the original text string to recognize links after the original text string is divided into two pieces during text string layout (CVE-2020-12247). | Steven Seeley of Qihoo 360 Vulcan Team |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free Information Disclosure vulnerability and crash due to the access of illegal memory when loading certain webpage (CVE-2020-15637). | Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Heap Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash. This occurs due to the application fails to execute a fault-tolerance mechanism when processing the dirty data in the image resources (CVE-2020-12248). | Steven Seeley of Qihoo 360 Vulcan Team |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Type Confusion Remote Code Execution vulnerability and crash due to the access of array whose length is larger than its initial length (CVE-2020-15638). | Rene Freingruber (@ReneFreingruber) and Patrick Wollgast working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |

**Vulnerability details**

| **Brief** | **Acknowledgement** |
| --- | --- |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to ActiveX not having a security permission control, which may allow JavaScript, LauchURL actions and Links to execute binary files/programs without prompting user for consent. (CVE-2018-19418/CVE-2018-19445/CVE-2018-19450/ CVE-2018-19451). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Illegally Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to ActiveX not having a security permission control, which may allow JavaScript and exportAsFDF to write any type of files to any location without the user's consent (CVE-2018-19446/ CVE-2018-19449). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to string1 URI Parsing Stack Based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to lack of a maximum length limit for the URL where a long URL string will cause stack overflow when parsing (CVE-2018-19447). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs when a javascript command is triggered by a mouse enter action or a focus lost which deletes the current annotation, and causes it to reference the released memory (CVE-2018-19452/ CVE-2018-19444). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |
| Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to Uninitialized Object Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This occurs due to the fact that the timer does not end when the form loses focus, which causes subsequent code to reference uninitialized objects (CVE-2018-19448). | Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite |

## Foxit Reader vulnerable to arbitrary command execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#570177

Original Release Date: 2010-04-02 | Last Revised: 2010-04-15

---

### Overview

Foxit Reader contains a vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands without requiring user interaction.

### Description

| [Foxit Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/reader/) is software designed to view Portable Document Format (PDF) files. The Adobe PDF Reference supports a "Launch action" that "... launches an application or opens or prints a document." Foxit Reader uses the [ShellExecute](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762153%28VS.85%29.aspx) function to handle PDFs that use a Launch action. In some cases, Foxit Reader will not prompt the user before an application is launched with a Launch action. It is also [reported](http://blog.didierstevens.com/2010/03/31/escape-from-foxit-reader/) that the Launch Action can be used to launch an executable that is included in the PDF document, which results in arbitrary code execution. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a PDF document, e.g. by visiting a website, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in [Foxit Reader 3.2.1.0401](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/downloads/index.php). This update will cause Foxit Reader to prompt the user before using a Launch Action. |

### ‚ÄúEscape From Foxit¬†Reader‚Äù

Filed under: [Hacking](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/hacking/),[PDF](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/pdf/) ‚Äî Didier Stevens @ 0:00

Thanks to a tip from [@riotz](http://twitter.com/riotz), I got [my PoC PDF](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2010/03/29/escape-from-pdf/) working on Foxit Reader. Remember, Foxit Reader issues no warning when launching a command! So I get to execute an embedded .EXE without any user interaction (except for the opening of the PDF document).

1. If you can live without the /Launch functionality (I can!), edit the executable:

   ‚Äì search for ‚Äú^@Launch^@‚Äù (^@ == null byte, file offset 7040965 in 3.13.1030) in Foxit Reader.exe,

3. Thanks for the tip Thomas. I use Foxit (and recommend it to others) because I \*thought\* it was safe! Trust Didier (aka PDF guru) to come up with something to prove that everything can be exploited ‚Ä¶ if you know how!

   @ Thomas: please, do tell us which program you used for doing that!

9. @SoerenB I‚Äôm not sure which tool he‚Äôs using, but I use xvi32.exe for hex editing. Simple and free.

13. I‚Äôve played around with the launch command before since seeing a metasploit module that used it, and I can understand how you got it to work with adobe reader, but in my tests with foxit reader I wasn‚Äôt able to get launch to work with parameters as is written in the pdf spec. Did you do this without parameters or did you figure out a way to pass parameters?

15. Has the test file been updated for Foxit?

19. @Anon Actually, @riotz found out how to pass parameters in Foxit, and then I updated my PoC for Foxit.

21. @‚Ä¶.. No, the test file already worked for Foxit.

23. Like another commentator here, I also went in to the ‚ÄúFoxit Reader.exe‚Äù file with a hex editor and altered the only reference to the word. ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù and changed it to something else.

    Could Didier or someone who has access to the test exploit confirm that this actually protects against this vulnerability?

    Thanks.

25. @booty You can test it yourself. Download the test PDF from this post and see if you still get a cmd.exe. The first step in the PoC is also cmd.exe. If this fails, the whole PoC fails.

27. @Didier ‚Äì Perhaps I am being blind, but I don‚Äôt see any PDF linked to this post. I do see one on the previous posting but that doesn‚Äôt appear to do anything on an un-patched fox it reader.

    Comment by booty ‚Äî Thursday 1 April 2010 @ [16:54](#comment-38062)
29. @booty No, there is no file linked to in this post. OK, then there‚Äôs something different with your Foxit version/installion/configuration, because the file from the previous post works with Adobe and Foxit.

31. Okay, I‚Äôm still not certain whether the hex-edit works. I would expect it to, but without verification or me being able to replicate the original vulnerability its hard to know..

    I don‚Äôt know whether somehow the patched version is staying resident in memory as I ran that version first or whether the version I have or my PC configuration isn‚Äôt vulnerable.

    Just in case it helps any of your work with fox it, etc, I am running version 3.1.4.1125 on windows XP sp3 x86. I also have kaspersky internet security, which sometimes pops-up warnings about one program launching another, but in this case it didn‚Äôt warn of anything. I also have javascript and internet search disabled in fox-it preferences.

    keep up the great work.

33. Foxit Corporation takes every security concern seriously and we focus our engineering resources on determining the cause of each issue and coming up with a complete and safe solution.

    After receiving word of a recent security concern, the Foxit development team immediately looked into the issue, confirmed the risk and resolved the situation quickly. Foxit expects to release a new version of Foxit Reader with this fix on April 2, 2010.

    To address the specific problems outlined, Foxit has added a warning dialog box that will pop up when a PDF file is opened with Foxit Reader, asking the user to agree to execute or not. This solution adds a layer of safety yet maintains Foxit Reader‚Äôs compliance with current PDF standards.

    Foxit is committed to adhering to and advancing current PDF standards; as such, we have developed a safer, easier and more widely accepted PDF document reader.

37. [‚Ä¶] Reader will not prompt the user before an application is launched with a Launch action. It is also reported that the Launch Action can be used to launch an executable that is included in the PDF document, [‚Ä¶]

41. @allyesno Yes if you include an exe with it but this was about using an exe embedded in the pdf so there is no warning. To do this you need to be able to pass arguments. Still haven‚Äôt figured out how he pulled it off thought, I tried the method in the spec as well as trying to break up the execution with various invalid characters but that hasn‚Äôt worked. It‚Äôs gotta be something really wacky that I‚Äôm not thinking of.
