Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2010-1300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the Yamamah Photo Gallery application, specifically in how it handles the `calbums` parameter. This parameter is used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`calbums` parameter) before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL commands.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** One of the exploits shows the use of a blind SQL injection technique, where the attacker doesn't receive direct error messages from the database but can infer results by observing application behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other user information as demonstrated by the exploit `union select` query that retrieves admin credentials.
- **Complete Compromise:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could gain control of the application's database, potentially modifying, deleting, or adding data.  This can lead to full compromise of the application's data and functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Requests:** The primary attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the application, specifically by manipulating the `calbums` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the application's URL structure, specifically how to access pages that use the vulnerable `calbums` parameter.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a fundamental understanding of SQL in order to craft the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Specific Exploits:**

The provided exploits demonstrate these attacks:
- **Reinstall Admin Information**: This refers to exploiting a reinstall mechanism that can bypass user checks.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The first exploit shows how to inject `calbums=1+and+31337-31337=0+--+` to test if the application is vulnerable by using a blind SQL injection.
- **SQL Injection to Extract Data:** The third exploit shows a direct SQL injection to get the administrator's username and password via a `union select` query.

**Additional Details:**

- Multiple exploits targeting the same vulnerability (SQL injection in `calbums` parameter) were submitted by different authors.
- The vulnerable application is Yamamah Photo Gallery version 1.00.
- The vulnerability can be identified via google dorks using `intext:"Powered By : Yamamah Version 1.00"`.
- The identified vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability.
