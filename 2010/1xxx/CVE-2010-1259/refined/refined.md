  "CVE-2010-1259": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from Internet Explorer accessing an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system for users with administrative rights. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted Web page",
      "Embedding a malicious ActiveX control in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to convince a user to view a malicious Web page or open a document with a malicious ActiveX control. The user interaction is a key component in the attack."
