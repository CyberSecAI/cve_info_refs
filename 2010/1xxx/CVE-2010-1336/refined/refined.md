  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The INVOhost application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements, potentially compromising the database integrity and exposing sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET parameters in `site.php`, `faq.php`, and `manuals.php`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with maliciously crafted SQL queries within the vulnerable parameters. No authentication is mentioned as needed, therefore, remote, unauthenticated access is assumed."

    "suggested_remediation": "The exploit suggests using `preg_replace` to remove non-alphanumeric characters from `$_GET` and `$_POST` variables: \n```php\n$_GET = preg_replace(\"|([^\\w\\s\'])|i\",'',$_GET);\n$_POST = preg_replace(\"|([^\\w\\s\'])|i\",'',$_POST);\n```"
