**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Bypass authentication
- Access sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials (passwords and usernames)
- Modify or delete data within the database
- Potentially gain control of the web server by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `id` parameter in the GET request to the vulnerable `profile.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting the `phpMDJ` application.
- No specific privileges or authentication are required to exploit the vulnerability.
