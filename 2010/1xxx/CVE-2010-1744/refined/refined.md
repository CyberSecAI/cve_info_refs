Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1744

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw present in the `id` parameter of the `product.html` page of the B2B Gold Script application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords of administrators, by using `group_concat(es_admin_name,char(58),es_pwd)` in the SQL query as shown in the exploit code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted GET request to the `product.html` page, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting the B2B Gold Script.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and techniques to craft a malicious SQL payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit example provided shows how to extract admin credentials using `union all select` to add the malicious query to the legitimate SQL query executed by the application.
- The vulnerable application is identified as "B2B Gold Script," which is a clone of the Alibaba Marketplace script.
- The vulnerability was reported and published on April 30, 2010.
