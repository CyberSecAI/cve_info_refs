Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how MySQL handles `DROP TABLE` operations on MyISAM tables when the `DATA DIRECTORY` or `INDEX DIRECTORY` options are used with symbolic links. Specifically, if these directories point to a location within the MySQL data directory via symlinks, the `DROP TABLE` command could unintentionally remove data files belonging to other tables, including critical system tables like `mysql.user`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Handling of Symbolic Links:** The core issue is that MySQL's `DROP TABLE` logic didn't properly check for or handle symbolic links that resolved to the data directory.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** While the database user might not have direct access to the data directory, the use of symlinks allowed them to indirectly manipulate files outside of their intended scope.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** MySQL did not validate that the provided `DATA DIRECTORY` or `INDEX DIRECTORY` paths were safe and not symlinks pointing to sensitive directories, leading to the potential for unintended file deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Loss:** The most significant impact is the unintentional deletion of data and index files belonging to other tables. This could lead to the corruption of critical database tables and general data loss. In the specific exploit example provided, deleting the underlying files of the `mysql.user` table would prevent further user management tasks including user deletion and break authentication within the database.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By deleting data files of essential tables, attackers could effectively render the database unusable leading to DoS.
- **Circumventing Security Restrictions:** By manipulating symlinks to remove data of tables they do not have direct access to, attackers can bypass user-level access control within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **SQL Injection:** Although SQL injection isn't directly related to the vulnerability described, it could provide an attacker with the necessary database credentials to exploit it.
- **Abuse of Privileges:** An attacker with CREATE and DROP privileges on a database could exploit this vulnerability by creating a table with symlinked data or index directory to the database's datadir, and then use `DROP TABLE` to delete files in that datadir.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Database User Account:** The attacker needs a valid MySQL database user account with CREATE and DROP privileges for at least one database.
- **Write Access to `/tmp` or another directory:** The attacker needs write access to a location where they can create a directory to use in the `DATA DIRECTORY` and `INDEX DIRECTORY` clauses when creating tables. This does not have to be the database's datadir.
- **Knowledge of MySQL's datadir:** The attacker needs to be aware of the location of the MySQL datadir in order to craft a symlink that would resolve to it.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in MySQL versions 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.4 and 6.0.
- The fix involves preventing the dropping of data/index files that are implicitly symlinked to the data home directory. For such tables, only the symlink is removed.
- The issue was a duplicate and a result of a bug in the fix for another bug, [Bug#32167](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167)

In summary, this vulnerability allowed a database user with limited privileges to leverage symlinks in conjunction with the `DROP TABLE` command to cause significant harm to the database, including data loss, DoS and bypassing access controls.
