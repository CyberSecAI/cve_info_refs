{
  "CVE-2010-1622": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The Spring Framework allows client-provided data to update object properties, including the class loader's, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure object property modification via client-provided data",
         "Lack of proper validation of class loader modification"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary command execution due to the ability to modify the class loader's URLs to point to attacker-controlled locations.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted HTTP request to a Spring application's form controller, modifying the class loader's URLs using a 'class.classLoader.URLs[0]' parameter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target application and control a location where they can host a malicious JAR file."
    }
