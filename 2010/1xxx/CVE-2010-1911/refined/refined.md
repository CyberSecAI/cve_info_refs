      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-1911",
      "root_cause": "The Consona Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS) has multiple vulnerabilities across different components.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `ns6plugindestructor.asp`.",
        "Unsafe methods in the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`).",

      "attack_vectors": [
        "Cross-site scripting to inject malicious code.",
        "Abuse of unsafe methods in ActiveX control to download and execute programs.",
