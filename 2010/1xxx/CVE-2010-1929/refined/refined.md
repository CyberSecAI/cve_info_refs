**Content from www.exploit-db.com_79affb50_20250124_194343.html:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Novell iManager
*   **Versions Affected:** 2.7, 2.7.3, 2.7.3 FTF2 (older versions probably affected too)
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation when creating classes in the 'Schema' menu. The class name is not properly validated on the server side, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** By tampering with the POST request that sends the class name when creating a new class, an authenticated user can define an overly long class name.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can overwrite return addresses and Structured Exception Handlers.
    *   Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user (in the case of iManager Workstation) or with SYSTEM privileges (in the case of iManager Server).
*   **Required Capabilities:** Authenticated user
*   **Mitigation:** Establish a Web Application Firewall rule for limiting the length of the parameters 'EnteredClassID' and 'NewClassName' in POST requests to the URI '/nps/servlet/webacc/'. Similar rules can also be established in the Apache webserver of the iManager installation.
