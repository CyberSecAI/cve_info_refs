- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla! component `com_sweetykeeper` version 1.5.x is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). The `controller` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization on the `controller` parameter, leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `controller` parameter to include local files, such as `/etc/passwd`.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `controller` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance. No special privileges are needed for exploitation. The attacker must know the path to the vulnerable component.
