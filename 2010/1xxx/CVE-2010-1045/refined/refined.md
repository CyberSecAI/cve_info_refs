Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1045:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions "CVE-2010-1045" along with a description of a "Joomla! Component com_productbook - SQL Injection" vulnerability. This matches the CVE ID and indicates that the content is indeed related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `com_productbook` component of Joomla. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the URL is vulnerable.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  SQL Injection is the primary vulnerability. The application is not validating the `id` parameter leading to malicious SQL being directly passed to the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the Joomla application. The attacker manipulates the 'id' parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application. No special authentication or internal network access is required.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the application's database. This can lead to sensitive data disclosure (e.g., usernames, passwords, email addresses), data modification, or even complete takeover of the database server.

**3. Exploit Details (from exploit-db.com):**

The exploit provided in the exploit-db entry demonstrates a UNION-based SQL injection. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Vulnerable URL:** `http://server/index.php?option=com_productbook&Itemid=97&func=detail&id=`
*   **Exploit Payload:** `-73+UNION all SELECT 1,2,3,concat(username,0x3a,password,0x3a,email),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58+from+condev.jos_users--`
*   **Explanation:**
    *   `-73`: A negative number that is likely intended to bypass application logic.
    *  `UNION all SELECT ...`: This clause injects a new result set into the original query.
    *   `concat(username,0x3a,password,0x3a,email)`: This part retrieves the username, password, and email columns from the `jos_users` table, concatenating them with a colon (`:`) as a delimiter.
    *   `from+condev.jos_users`: Specifies the database and table to fetch user data from
    *   `--`: The double dash is used for comments, to ignore the rest of the SQL query.

**4. Summary:**
The provided content confirms that CVE-2010-1045 is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_productbook` component for Joomla. The exploit details show how an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials.
