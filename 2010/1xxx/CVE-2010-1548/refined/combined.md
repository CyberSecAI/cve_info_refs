# Drupal Ctools 6.x-1.3 Multiple Vulnerabilities

[disclosure](/tag/disclosure) [drupal](/tag/drupal)
30 November -0001

[CVE-2010-1546](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2010-1546), [CVE-2010-1547](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2010-1547) and [CVE-2010-1548](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2010-1548)

#### Description of Vulnerability:

Drupal ([http://drupal.org](http://drupal.org "Drupal.org")) is a robust content management system (CMS) written in PHP and MySQL that provides extensibility through hundreds of third party modules. The Chaos tool suite module ([http://drupal.org/project/ctools](http://drupal.org/project/ctools "Chaos Tools Suite")) suffers from an arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability (CVE-2010-1546).

Chaos tool suite also fails to perform proper forms checking for linked functionality in administrative forms which results in cross site request forgery (XSRF) vulnerabilities (CVE-2010-1547).

Chaos tools suite also fails to perform status checking when implementing auto complete functionality allowing for bypass of node publish settings or other protections such as those imposed by the Protected Node module ([http://drupal.org/project/protected\_node](http://drupal.org/project/protected_node "Drupal Protected Node module")) (CVE-2010-1548).

Chaos tools suite also contains an unexploitable (as written) SQL injection vulnerability.

#### Systems affected:

Drupal 6.16 with Ctools 6.x-1.3 was tested and shown to be vulnerable

#### Impact

Authenticated users with 'administer page manager' permissions can execute arbitrary PHP code, which could lead to compromise of the web server process. Users with 'access content' permission can view titles of unpublished nodes. Attackers could cause authenticated users to alter configuration using XSRF.

#### Mitigating factors:

Attacker must be able to access the Pages administration forms, which is possible for authenticated users with the 'administer page manager' permission.

#### Technical discussion and proof of concept:

The page importer fails to sanitize user input before use in an eval() statement on line 1279 of the page\_manager/plugins/tasks/page.admin.inc file. This vulnerability can be exploited via access to the page importer form.

Proof of concept:

1. Install Drupal 6.16 and Ctools 6.x-1.3
2. Navigate to the Import Page form at ?q=admin/build/pages/import
3. Insert an arbitrary page name and viable path
4. Enter arbitrary PHP code in the text area labeled "Paste page code here:" For example entering "touch ('/var/www/html/drupal-6.16/sites/default/files/foo.bar');" in the text area will cause the server to create a file at the path specified assuming the web server has write permissions at that location.

The page variant importer fails to sanitize user supplied PHP code before use in line 1413 of page\_manager.admin.inc. The Clone function is likely also affected but no PoC is provided (see line 1563 in page\_manager.admin.inc.

Proof of concept:

1. Same as above
2. http://172.16.46.129/drupal-6.16/admin/build/pages/edit/contact\_user
3. Click the 'Import variant' tab
4. Enter an arbitrary variant name
5. Enter PHP code into the text area, such as "phpinfo();die();"
6. Click 'Update' to view the resulting PHP code output

The Pages list at ?q=/admin/build/pages provides a list of pages with an 'enable' or 'disable' link in the table display depending on the status of the page. This value can be changed with a URL request rather than a form post, and no token is provided to prevent against XSRF.

Proof of concept:

1. Same as above
2. Log in as a user with privileges to administer pages
3. Paste the URL ?q=admin/build/pages/nojs/disable/contact\_user into the URL to disable the contact\_user page.

The Chaos Tools suite fails to properly enforce permissions resulting in an information disclosure vulnerability.

Proof of concept:

1. Same as above
2. Create a new page with the title 'Unpublished page' and uncheck the 'Published' box in 'Publishing options' before saving
3. Call the URL ?q=ctools/autocomplete/node/u to view the node title and associated NID

The Chaos tools suite has an unexploitable SQL injection vulnerability in ctools/includes/export.inc in the function ctools\_export\_load\_object because it fails to sanitize the $table parameter before use in a SQL query on line 78. The module itself does not allow user supplied input to this parameter but it is possible that modules which extend ctools could do so.

#### Vendor response:

Upgrade to the latest version of Ctools. Ref [http://drupal.org/node/803944](http://drupal.org/node/803944 "SA-CONTRIB-2010-058: Chaos tool suite - Multiple vulnerabilities").

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Drupal (<http://drupal.org>) is a robust content management system (CMS)
written in PHP and MySQL that provides extensibility through hundreds of
third party modules.  The Chaos tool suite module
(<http://drupal.org/project/ctools>) suffers from an arbitrary PHP code
execution vulnerability (CVE-2010-1546).

Chaos tool suite also fails to perform proper forms checking for linked
functionality in administrative forms which results in cross site
request forgery (XSRF) vulnerabilities (CVE-2010-1547).

Chaos tools suite also fails to perform status checking when
implementing auto complete functionality allowing for bypass of node
publish settings or other protections such as those imposed by the
Protected Node module (<http://drupal.org/project/protected_node>)
(CVE-2010-1548).

Systems affected:
- -----------------
Drupal 6.16 with Ctools 6.x-1.3 was tested and shown to be vulnerable

Impact
- ------
Authenticated users with 'administer page manager' permissions can
execute arbitrary PHP code, which could lead to compromise of the web
server process.  Users with 'access content' permission can view titles
of unpublished nodes.  Attackers could cause authenticated users to
alter configuration using XSRF.

Mitigating factors:
- -------------------
Attacker must be able to access the Pages administration forms, which is
possible for authenticated users with the 'administer page manager'
permission.

Vendor response:
- ----------------
Upgrade to the latest version of Ctools.  Ref
