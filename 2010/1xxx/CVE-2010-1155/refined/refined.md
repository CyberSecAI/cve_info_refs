{
  "CVE-2010-1155": {
    "Description": "irssi did not perform certificate host validation when using SSL connections. An attacker could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications.",
    "Root cause": "The irssi IRC client did not properly validate the hostname in the server's SSL certificate against the hostname used for the connection. This lack of validation allows an attacker to present a fraudulent certificate.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient verification of SSL/TLS certificates"
    ],
    "Impact": "Man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could intercept and potentially modify encrypted communications, stealing sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the irssi client and the IRC server. This could be achieved on a local network or by compromising a router or network infrastructure."
