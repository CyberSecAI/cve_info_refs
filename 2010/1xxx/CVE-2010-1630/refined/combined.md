At least I could find this patch. It seems to ensure that the used forum
ID is actually the forum where the posting being edited is part of. Still,
I'm not sure what hole this would fix.

Hello,

We are very pleased to announce the availability of the phpBB "quite furry" 3.0.5 package. This release fixes numerous bugs since the 3.0.4 release, corrects style issues, fixing one very minor security bug as well as increasing performance and scalability again. We also decided to add a few new minor features.

New features and important changes are:

* Added and refined CAPTCHA options to better protect against new version of CAPTCHA crackers.
* Added an option to the registration screen to allow users to refresh the displayed CAPTCHA.
* Performance improvements for native fulltext search.
* Added a new search option. The admin can define the maximum number of words allowed to search for. This option gives control about the maximum search load.
* Search indexing should no longer stall for some installations.
* Conflicting files are able to be downloaded now within the automatic updater for manual inspection.
* The database updater now checks for an incompatible database schema in case the database version got updated. The admin will be notified about possible solutions and repair scripts.
* We now set the connection encoding for MySQL versions 4.1.0 to 4.1.2. This may fix some conversion issues with special characters.
* Language pack authors now see errors/notices within their language pack if they enabled DEBUG\_EXTRA.
* Flash files now display again after update to flash player 10.

Please note that we urge you to update. phpBB 3.0.5 has seen a lot of bug fixes, some being quite important for a smooth operation of your forums. With this release our support team will only give support for phpBB 3.0.5, updates to phpBB 3.0.5 and conversions to phpBB 3.0.5. Submissions to our trackers for older versions will not be accepted, please make sure you update/upgrade before you submit a bug report.

If you use a different language pack than the one provided with the download head to our language packs download section. You may find already updated language packs for your language.

Changes since 3.0.4:

* [Fix] Delete user entry from ban list table upon user deletion (Bug #40015 - Patch by TerraFrost)
* [Fix] Posts incremented for multiple approval of the same topic (Bug #40495 - Patch by TerraFrost)
* [Fix] Missing end " in quote bb tag deletes text (Bug #40565 - Patch by TerraFrost)
* [Fix] Friend/foe system displays posts made by foes while composing (Bug #40325 - Patch by TerraFrost and Highway of Life)
* [Fix] Check forum\_image whether it exists (Bug #39005 - Patch by TerraFrost)
* [Fix] The sql query in acp\_users.php lacks a condition (Bug #40275 - Patch by grimskies)
* [Fix] Added missing read permission information for some phpbb\_chmod() calls
* [Fix] Correctly display future dates (Bug #38755)
* [Fix] Fix guest/bot session problems with apache authentication plugin (Bug #41085)
* [Fix] Whois now works reliably for RIRs other than APNIC and RIPE. (Bug #40085)
* [Fix] Correctly convert Niels' Birthday MOD to the date format used in phpBB3. (Bug #32895)
* [Fix] Changed the success message when requesting a new password to be more accurate. (Bug #41405)
* [Fix] Add missing anti-abuse email headers to acp\_inactive.php and ucp\_resend.php.

Please refer to the changelog for a complete list of fixes since 3.0.4:

[http://www.phpbb.com/support/documents. ... &version=3](http://www.phpbb.com/support/documents.php?mode=changelog&version=3)

A short explanation of how to do a conversion, installation or update is included within the provided INSTALL.html file, please be sure to read it.

**Minimum Requirements**

phpBB3 has a few requirements which must be met before you are able to install and use it.

* A webserver or web hosting account running on any major Operating System with support for PHP
* A SQL database system, one of:
  + MySQL 3.23 or above (MySQLi supported)
  + PostgreSQL 7.3+
  + SQLite 2.8.2+
  + Firebird 2.0+
  + MS SQL Server 2000 or above (directly or via ODBC)
  + Oracle
* **PHP 4.3.3+ (>=4.3.3, >4.4.x, >5.x.x, >6.0-dev (compatible))** with support for the database you intend to use.
* getimagesize() function need to be enabled
* These optional presence of the following modules within PHP will provide access to additional features, but they are not required.
  + zlib Compression support
  + Remote FTP support
  + XML support
  + Imagemagick support
  + GD Support

The presence of each of these optional modules will be checked during the installation process.

**Security**

Security issues found should be reported to our [security tracker](http://www.phpbb.com/security/) in the usual way.

**Available packages**

If you experience problems with the automatic update (white screens, timeouts, etc.) we recommend using the "changed files only" or "patch" method for updating.

With this release, there are five packages available.

* **Full Package:**

  Contains entire phpBB3 source and english language files.
* **Automatic Update Package:**

  Update package for the automatic updater, containing the changes from previous release to this release.
* **Changed Files Only:**

  Contains only those files changed from previous versions of phpBB3. Please note this archive contains changed files for each previous release.
* **Patch Files:**

  Contains patch compatible patches from previous versions of phpBB3.
* **Code Changes Package:**

  Package contains changes to the following sections: Language changes, prosilver style changes and subsilver2 style changes.

Select whichever package is most suitable for you. As a tiny guide we recommend the following methods based on the requirements:

* For a new installation you should use the Full Package
* For updates of boards without modifications you can basically use the Automatic Update Package (guided update) or the Changed Files Only package (manual update).
* For updates of boards with modifications you should use the Automatic Update Package. If you are confident with patch files and patching you can use the Patch Files Package.
* Style Authors and Translators may use the Code Changes Package to update their styles or language packs directly.
* International Support Teams may use the Patch Package in conjunction with the Code Changes to better support users having problems with conflicts or specific code sections.
* If you are a hoster/provider, you may want to use the Patch Files Package to update all of your client installations.

**Please ensure you read the INSTALL and README documents in docs/ before proceeding with installation, updates or conversions!**.

**Download Locations**

You can of course find this download available on our [downloads page](http://www.phpbb.com/downloads/).

Our [release archive](http://www.phpbb.com/files/archive/) provides all packages we build. If you do not find the desired package you may want to have a look at the release archive.

<http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=2014195>

Please assign cve. Cite:
"Otherwise, it is possible for users to bypass permission settings under the
following circumstances:

    * Feeds are enabled
    * Any of the posts or topics feeds are enabled
    * The unauthorised user - or one of the groups they are a member of - have
forum permissions set on a private forum
    * If you have excluded a forum from the list of forums that provide feeds,
it is unaffected"

Also, I think this phpbb 3.0.5 still has no cve (I requested that before
here):

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.
