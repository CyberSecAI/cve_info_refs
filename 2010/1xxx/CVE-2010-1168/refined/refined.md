  "summary": "The Perl Safe module before 2.25 has a vulnerability that can be exploited via a specially crafted Perl script. It allows attackers to bypass the Safe module restrictions by using implicitly called methods on implicitly blessed Perl objects returned from unsafe code evaluation, leading to arbitrary code execution outside the intended safe compartment.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "weakness": "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Compartment",
      "description": "The vulnerability lies in the way the Safe.pm module handles implicitly called methods (like DESTROY or AUTOLOAD) on objects returned from within a Safe compartment. These methods, when implicitly invoked outside the Safe compartment due to object access or destruction, can bypass the intended restrictions.",
       "impact": "Attackers can break out of the safe compartment, gaining the ability to execute arbitrary Perl code with the privileges of the user running the script. This can result in a complete system compromise.",
      "attackVector": "A specially crafted Perl script is required to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker would need to trick a user into running a malicious perl script that utilizes the vulnerable Safe.pm module."

        }
      ],
   "remediation": "Upgrade to Safe.pm version 2.25 or higher, which includes fixes for this issue and provides a method (wrap_code_ref()) to execute code in a Safe compartment."
