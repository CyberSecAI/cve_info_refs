Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by improper parsing of authentication information by the Internet Information Services (IIS) web server when Extended Protection for Authentication is enabled. Specifically, the server does not correctly allocate memory when parsing specific authentication data received from a client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability arising from incorrect memory allocation during the parsing of authentication data.
*   **Improper Authentication Validation:** The vulnerability stems from how IIS validates authentication information, leading to the memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same privileges as the Worker Process Identity (WPI), which by default is the Network Service account on older systems and a virtual application pool identity on newer systems. If the WPI is configured with administrative privileges, the impact is more severe.
*   **Complete Control:** An attacker could take complete control of an affected system.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise, enabling further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** Exploitation occurs remotely through a specially crafted HTTP request sent to the vulnerable IIS server.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, though the authentication may be via compromised credentials.
*   **Extended Protection for Authentication:** The vulnerability is present when Extended Protection for Authentication is enabled on the server and not enabled on the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Authentication:** While the content states "unauthenticated" in one location, the Microsoft bulletin specifies that the attacker must be "authenticated".
*   **Understanding of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft a specific HTTP request to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects systems running IIS 6.0, 7.0 and 7.5 on various versions of Windows Server and Windows 7, if Extended Protection is configured.
*   Extended Protection for Authentication is not enabled by default and requires the installation of KB973917 on older systems.
*   A workaround is to configure IIS to require token checking, which prevents clients without Extended Protection from authenticating, thus blocking the attack vector, but this also impacts functionality.
*   The Microsoft Exploitability Index is used to rate the likelihood of exploitation of this type of vulnerability. For this vulnerability the rating is important because of the possibility of remote code execution.

In summary, CVE-2010-1256 is a remote code execution vulnerability in IIS arising from improper memory allocation during authentication, which can be exploited by a remote attacker through a crafted HTTP request when Extended Protection is enabled.
