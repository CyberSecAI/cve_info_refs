Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a vulnerability in the HP OpenVMS Auditing component. This vulnerability can be exploited to achieve information disclosure, privilege escalation and Denial of Service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local Information Disclosure:** The auditing vulnerability can expose sensitive information to local users.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability allows local users to gain elevated privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Specifically on HP OpenVMS Itanium platforms, the vulnerability can be exploited to cause a DoS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to confidential information that is not intended to be accessible by them.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Attackers can gain control over the system by escalating their privileges and then perform unauthorized actions.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerable system can be rendered unusable, disrupting services for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **local**. This means that the attacker must have some form of access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable HP OpenVMS system. The provided CVSS score (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S) indicates that the attack requires a local user with some form of authentication ('Au:S' which seems to be a typo and should be 'Au:N' as per the CVSS v2 specification).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin mentions that a different vulnerability exists specifically for OpenVMS on Itanium platforms, leading to a Denial of Service.
*   Patch kits are available for various versions of HP OpenVMS on both ALPHA and Itanium platforms.
*   The provided CVSS vector is (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C) which is 6.8, which implies that the attack requires a local user with some form of authentication.
*   The document is an official HP Security Bulletin, indicating the seriousness of the issue.
