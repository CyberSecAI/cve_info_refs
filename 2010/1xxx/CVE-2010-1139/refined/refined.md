Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1139:

**Root Cause:**

- A format string vulnerability exists within the `vmrun` utility on Linux-based systems. This utility is part of the VMware VIX API.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `vmrun` utility incorrectly handles format specifiers when listing processes. This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers, leading to potential code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who runs the `vmrun` command. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system if the user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack is triggered by issuing a `vmrun` command that lists processes, and an attacker can inject malicious format strings when the process list is being displayed.
- A local attacker can exploit this, if they can execute vmrun.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `vmrun` utility on a vulnerable Linux system.
- The attacker also needs the ability to influence the output of vmrun by, for example, crafting specific inputs to be processed by the tool.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability specifically affects Linux-based systems.
- The vulnerability is present in the `vmrun` utility of the VMware VIX API version 1.6.x.
- It is fixed in VIX API version 1.7 and later.
