Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-1552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `snmpviewer.exe` CGI program of HP OpenView Network Node Manager.
*   The `doLoad` function within `snmpviewer.exe` uses `sprintf()` with a `%s` format specifier.
*   User-controlled input from two POST variables, `act` and `app`, is directly used in the `sprintf()` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to provide overly large strings for the `act` and `app` variables. This leads to a stack-based buffer overflow when these strings are copied by `sprintf()`, which attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful buffer overflow can allow the attacker to overwrite return addresses on the stack and redirect execution flow to attacker controlled shellcode. This leads to remote code execution under the context of the webserver process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network without authentication, by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `snmpviewer.exe`
*   **CGI Program:** The vulnerability occurs within a CGI program, which is directly accessible through a web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system running HP OpenView Network Node Manager.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for any authentication credentials.
*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTTP POST request that includes oversized strings for the `act` and `app` variables, leading to the buffer overflow.

**Additional Information:**

*   Hewlett-Packard released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter ID.
