Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1481:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper escaping of the `width` parameter within pmwiki's table feature. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML attributes and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization or proper output escaping when handling the `width` parameter in the table feature.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the victim's browser.
- Possible defacement of website content.
- Potential for session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript through the width parameter of the table syntax. The crafted width parameter will be stored by the application and executed in the context of other users browsing the wiki page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify content on a pmwiki instance.
- No special privileges beyond content manipulation are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vendor was contacted but initially did not respond.
- The issue was fixed in version 2.2.16.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a wiki page that contains a specially crafted table.
- The vulnerable code snippet provided demonstrates how a malicious `onMouseOver` event is injected.
