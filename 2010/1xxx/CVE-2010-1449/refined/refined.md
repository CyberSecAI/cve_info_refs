The spec defines certain typical ZSIZE values (1 for B/W, 3 for RGB, 4 for RGB+Alpha), but it does not forbid greater values. ZSIZE is read as 16bit value from the image header, so values up to 0xffff can be specified. rgbimgmodule implementation assumes that ZSIZE <= 4, but does not check that. It uses 32bit value to store info for one pixel (so up to 4 channels, module only supports 1 byte per channel, BPC == 2 images are not supported) and uses pattern 3-z (for z in 0 .. ZSIZE-1) to adjust the pointer position within a 32bit value used to store one pixel to write particular channel data. Therefore, interleaverow() can be called with its third argument having a negative value, resulting in buffer underflow.",
