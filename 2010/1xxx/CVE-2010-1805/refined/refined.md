- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A search path issue exists in Safari when launching Windows Explorer to display the location of a downloaded file. The full path to the executable is not specified.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper search path handling, lack of full path specification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution by placing a malicious application in a directory writable by other users. When Safari attempts to reveal the location of a downloaded file, the malicious application can be executed.
- **Attack vectors**:  Opening a file in a specific directory, where the attacker has placed a malicious executable and the target has downloaded a file, then using Safari's "reveal in folder" functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable in a directory writable by other users on the target Windows system and the user needs to download a file in that specific directory.
