{
  "CVE-2010-1170": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way the PostgreSQL enforced permission checks on scripts written in PL/Tcl. Once the PL/Tcl procedural language was registered on particular database, a remote, authenticated user, privileged to create databases, running a specially-crafted PL/Tcl script, could use this flaw to bypass intended PL/Tcl trusted mode restrictions, allowing them to run arbitrary Tcl scripts with the privileges of the database server.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl code from the pltcl_modules table regardless of the table's ownership and permissions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient permission checks on scripts written in PL/Tcl",
		"Bypass of intended PL/Tcl trusted mode restrictions"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, authenticated user, privileged to create databases, could run arbitrary Tcl scripts with the privileges of the database server, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted PL/Tcl scripts executed by a remote, authenticated user with database creation privileges."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be a remote, authenticated user with privileges to create databases. Knowledge of how to craft a malicious PL/Tcl script is required."
