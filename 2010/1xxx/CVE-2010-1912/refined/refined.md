{
  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "The Consona (formerly SupportSoft) Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS) has multiple vulnerabilities in different components.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) in `ns6plugindestructor.asp`",
      "Unsafe methods provided by `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`)",
      "Buffer overflow in `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`)",
      "Local privilege elevation in Repair Service (`tgsrv.exe`) (Windows Vista and Windows 7 only)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user, and potentially gain SYSTEM privileges via the Repair Service. This could be achieved by convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document, such as a web page or HTML email message.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cross-site scripting to instantiate the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
      "Exploiting unsafe methods of the ActiveX control to download and execute arbitrary programs.",
       "Leveraging the Repair Service to elevate privileges from user/low rights to SYSTEM."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to view a specially crafted HTML document. This can be achieved through techniques such as sending a malicious link via email or embedding the attack in a malicious website.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve remote code execution with elevated privileges. The XSS vulnerability in `ns6plugindestructor.asp` can be used to instantiate the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` control, which can then be used to download and execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the Repair Service can be used to elevate privileges to SYSTEM."
