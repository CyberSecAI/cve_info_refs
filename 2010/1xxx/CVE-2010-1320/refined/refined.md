  "cveId": "CVE-2010-1320",
  "description": "Double free vulnerability in do_tgs_req.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.7.x and 1.8.x before 1.8.2 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a request associated with (1) renewal or (2) validation.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to a double free in the KDC's ticket renewal or validation process. When handling these requests, the KDC copies `header_ticket->enc_part2` to `enc_tkt_reply`. The `enc_tkt_reply.authorization_data` then becomes an alias for memory that belongs to the original request (`header_ticket`). Both `header_ticket` and `enc_tkt_reply` are freed when `process_tgs_req()` exits, resulting in a double free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double free vulnerability",
      "Incorrect memory management",
       "Use of aliased memory"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated remote attacker can crash the KDC, leading to a denial of service. In some circumstances and on certain platforms, this vulnerability could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution, although this is considered difficult and no such exploits are known.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network-based attacks"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated to send a malicious ticket renewal or validation request."
