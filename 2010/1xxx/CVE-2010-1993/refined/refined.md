Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Opera's improper handling of `IFRAME` elements that have a `mailto:` URL in their `SRC` attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** Opera fails to correctly process or limit the impact of `mailto:` URLs within `IFRAME` elements.
- **Resource Consumption:** By loading multiple `IFRAME` elements pointing to `mailto:` URLs, an attacker can cause the browser to repeatedly attempt to open the default email client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a DoS. The excessive resource consumption can slow down or freeze the browser, potentially leading to system instability. The email client may also be repeatedly launched, disrupting the user's workflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack is launched remotely through a malicious HTML document.
- **Web Page:** An attacker can host a webpage containing malicious code, which, when accessed by a vulnerable browser, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host an HTML page, which the victim must then access using a vulnerable version of Opera.

**Additional Notes:**
- The first article describes a related issue in other browsers (Firefox, Chrome, IE) involving `mailto:` links that can be used to perform a DoS. However the content indicates that this attack is achieved differently, and is not the same as the vulnerability in Opera.
- The opensuse.org content mentions the vulnerability in relation to Opera 9.52.
- The opensuse.org content is a summary report and doesn't detail the technical specifics of the vulnerability but it does provide that the fix for the vulnerability is included in the update for Opera.
