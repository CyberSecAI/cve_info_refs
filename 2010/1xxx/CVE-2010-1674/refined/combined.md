How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1258)

## Topic

Updated quagga packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Quagga is a TCP/IP based routing software suite. The Quagga bgpd daemon
implements the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing protocol. The Quagga
ospfd and ospf6d daemons implement the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
routing protocol.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the bgpd daemon
processed malformed Extended Communities path attributes. An attacker could
send a specially-crafted BGP message, causing bgpd on a target system to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running bgpd. The UPDATE message would have to arrive from an explicitly
configured BGP peer, but could have originated elsewhere in the BGP
network. (CVE-2011-3327)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the bgpd daemon
processed malformed route Extended Communities attributes. A configured
BGP peer could crash bgpd on a target system via a specially-crafted BGP
message. (CVE-2010-1674)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the ospf6d daemon
processed malformed Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use
this flaw to crash ospf6d on an adjacent router. (CVE-2011-3323)

A flaw was found in the way the ospf6d daemon processed malformed link
state advertisements. An OSPF neighbor could use this flaw to crash
ospf6d on a target system. (CVE-2011-3324)

A flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed malformed Hello
packets. An OSPF neighbor could use this flaw to crash ospfd on a
target system. (CVE-2011-3325)

A flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed malformed link state
advertisements. An OSPF router in the autonomous system could use this flaw
to crash ospfd on a target system. (CVE-2011-3326)

An assertion failure was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed
certain Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use this flaw to
cause ospfd on an adjacent router to abort. (CVE-2012-0249)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed
certain Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use this flaw to
crash ospfd on an adjacent router. (CVE-2012-0250)

Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting CVE-2011-3327,
CVE-2011-3323, CVE-2011-3324, CVE-2011-3325, and CVE-2011-3326; and the
CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2012-0249 and CVE-2012-0250. CERT-FI acknowledges
Riku Hietamaki, Tuomo Untinen and Jukka Taimisto of the Codenomicon CROSS
project as the original reporters of CVE-2011-3327, CVE-2011-3323,
CVE-2011-3324, CVE-2011-3325, and CVE-2011-3326. The CERT/CC acknowledges
Martin Winter at OpenSourceRouting.org as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-0249 and CVE-2012-0250.

Users of quagga should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the bgpd, ospfd, and ospf6d daemons will be restarted
automatically.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Quagga: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201202-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Quagga, the worst of which
leading to remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/quagga** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.99.20** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.99.20** |

### Background

Quagga is a free routing daemon replacing Zebra supporting RIP, OSPF and
BGP.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A BGP peer could send a Route-Refresh message with specially-crafted ORF
record, which can cause Quagga's bgpd to crash or possibly execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Quagga's bgpd; a
BGP update AS path request with unknown AS type, or malformed
AS-Pathlimit or Extended-Community attributes could lead to Denial of
Service (daemon crash), an error in bgpd when handling AS\_PATH attributes
within UPDATE messages can
be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow resulting in a crash
of the
daemon and disruption of IPv4 routing, two errors in ospf6d and ospfd can
each be exploited to crash the daemon and disrupt IP routing.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Quagga users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/quagga-0.99.20"

```

Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- aaa\_base
shell meta characters in file names could cause interactive shells
to execute arbitrary commands when performing tab expansion
(CVE-2011-0468).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4
- flash-player
The Adobe Flash Player was updated to version 10.2.153.1 to fix a
buffer overflow. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0609).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- pango
Specially crafted font files could cause a heap corruption in
applications linked against pango (CVE-2011-0064, CVE-2011-0020).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- openssl

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2197-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Florian Weimer

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : quagga
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-1674 CVE-2010-1675

It has been discovered that the Quagga routing daemon contains two
denial-of-service vulnerabilities in its BGP implementation:

CVE-2010-1674
	A crafted Extended Communities attribute triggers a null
        pointer dereference which causes the BGP daemon to crash.
	The crafted attributes are not propagated by the Internet
	core, so only explicitly configured direct peers are able
	to exploit this vulnerability in typical configurations.

CVE-2010-1675
	The BGP daemon resets BGP sessions when it encounters
	malformed AS_PATHLIMIT attributes, introducing a distributed
	BGP session reset vulnerability which disrupts packet
	forwarding.  Such malformed attributes are propagated by the
	Internet core, and exploitation of this vulnerability is not
	restricted to directly configured BGP peers.

This security update removes AS_PATHLIMIT processing from the BGP
implementation, preserving the configuration statements for backwards
compatibility.  (Standardization of this BGP extension was abandoned
long ago.)

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.10-1lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.17-2+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
