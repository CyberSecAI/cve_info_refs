Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a format string vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `ovet_demandpoll.exe` process directly uses the content of the 'sel' POST variable in a `vnsprintf()` call without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the `ovet_demandpoll.exe` process. This could allow complete system compromise (full control over the system).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and over the network, through a web server.
- Attackers need to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `webappmon.exe` CGI application, including a malicious format string in the 'sel' variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable by anyone with network access to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) versions 7.01, 7.51, and 7.53.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher working with the TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative.
- HP has released patches to address this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
- The affected operating systems include HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows.
