- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way Safari handles a specially crafted webpage containing a JavaScript code that leads to memory exhaustion and browser crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The exploit uses a large amount of string manipulation with a crafted string and an array to cause a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit results in the Safari browser freezing and then crashing, causing a denial-of-service. The attacker can potentially leverage the crash for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, requiring the user to visit a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host the malicious webpage and entice the victim to visit it using the Safari browser on iOS (iPhone & iPod Touch) devices running version 3.1.3.
