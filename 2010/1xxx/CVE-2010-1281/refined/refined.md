User interaction is required in that a target visit a malicious website.  The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing Director files. The vulnerable function is exported as an ordinal from the iml32.dll module. Ordinal 1409 trusts a value from the file as an offset and updates pointers accordingly. By crafting a large enough value and seeking the file pointer past the end of a buffer this can be abused to corrupt heap memory. An attacker can abuse this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser. |\n| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-12.html> |\n| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-02-02 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-05-11 - Coordinated public release of advisory |\n| CREDIT | Anonymous |",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Adobe Shockwave parses Director files. Specifically, the function at ordinal 1409 in `iml32.dll` trusts a value from the file as an offset, which is then used to update pointers. This lack of validation allows for out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of offset value from Director files",
      "Out-of-bounds memory access due to a crafted offset value leading to heap corruption",
       "Use of untrusted input to calculate pointer offsets"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. This can occur under the context of the user running the browser. Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, including unauthorized access, data modification, and malware execution.",
