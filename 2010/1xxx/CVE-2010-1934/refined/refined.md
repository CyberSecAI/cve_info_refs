{
  "CVE-2010-1934": {
    "Description": "Openplanning 1.00 suffers from multiple file inclusion vulnerabilities, allowing for both local (LFI) and remote (RFI) file inclusion.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file paths, which results in the ability to include arbitrary local or remote files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
     "Impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local or remote files which may lead to code execution, data exfiltration, or other forms of exploitation. RFI allows remote code execution by including a malicious file from an attacker-controlled server.",
    "Attack vectors": {
        "LFI": "An attacker sends a crafted request to the `soustab.php` script with a malicious value in the `dsn[phptype]` parameter. This parameter is vulnerable to LFI.",
        "RFI": "An attacker sends a crafted request to various `*.class.php` scripts located under `gen/obj/` directory, using the `path_om` parameter. These parameters are vulnerable to RFI."
     },
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
  }
