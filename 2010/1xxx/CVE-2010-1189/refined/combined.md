This is a security and bugfix release of MediaWiki 1.15.2.

Two security issues were discovered:

A CSS validation issue was discovered which allows editors to display
external images in wiki pages. This is a privacy concern on public
wikis, since a malicious user may link to an image on a server they
control, which would allow that attacker to gather IP addresses and
other information from users of the public wiki. All sites running
publicly-editable MediaWiki installations are advised to upgrade. All
versions of MediaWiki (prior to this one) are affected.

A data leakage vulnerability was discovered in thumb.php which affects
wikis which restrict access to private files using img_auth.php, or
some similar scheme. All versions of MediaWiki since 1.5 are affected.

Deleting thumb.php is a suitable workaround for private wikis which do
not use $wgThumbnailScriptPath or $wgLocalRepo['thumbScriptUrl'].
Alternatively, you can upgrade to MediaWiki 1.15.2 or backport the
patch below to whatever version of MediaWiki you are using.

MediaWiki is not compatible with PHP 5.3.1 due to a bug in that
release, which is fixed in PHP 5.3.2. This release of MediaWiki will
refuse to upgrade if an affected version of PHP is present. Note that
local or distribution-specific backports of the PHP bug fix are
supported. See <http://bugs.php.net/50394> for details.

Package        : mediawiki
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : none
CVE ID         : none assigned yet

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mediawiki, a web-based wiki
engine.  The following issues have been identified:

Insufficient input sanitization in the CSS validation code allows editors
to display external images in wiki pages.  This can be a privacy concern
on public wikis as it allows attackers to gather IP addresses and other
information by linking these images to a web server under their control.

Insufficient permission checks have been found in thump.php which can lead
to disclosure of image files that are restricted to certain users
(e.g. with img_auth.php).

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12.0-2lenny4.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.15.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.15.2-1.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- krb5
Specially crafted requests be authenticated remote attackers could
crash the KDC (CVE-2010-1320).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- clamav
Specially crafted CAB archives could crash clamav (CVE-2010-1311) or
bypass virus detection (CVE-2010-0098). clamav has been updated to
version 0.96 which fixes those issues.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- systemtap
Remote attackers could execute arbitrary commands by including shell
meta characters in commands to the stap server (CVE-2009-4273).
Commands with a long arguments list could cause a buffer overflow
and crash the system if a script tried to retrieve the argument list
(CVE-2010-0411).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- apache2
When using a multithreaded MPM apache could leak memory of requests
handled by a different thread when processing subrequests
(CVE-2010-0434).
Specially crafted requests could crash mod\_proxy\_ajp (CVE-2010-0408).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- glib2
The when copying symbolic links the g\_file\_copy function set the
target of the link to mode 0777 therefore exposing potentially
sensitive information or allowing other user to modify files they
should not have access to (CVE-2009-3289).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- mediawiki
MediaWiki was prone to a CSS validation flaw and data leakage
vulnerability (CVE-2010-1189, CVE-2010-1190).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- apache
Specially crafted requests could lead to an integer overflow in
mod\_proxy. Attackers could exploit that to crash apache or
potentially cause execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2010-0010).
The problem only affects 64bit architectures.
Affected Products: SLES9

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.
