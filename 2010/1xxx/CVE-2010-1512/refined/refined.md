  "CVE-2010-1512": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in aria2, a download client. The \"name\" attribute of the \"file\" element of metalink files is not properly sanitised before using it to download files. If a user is tricked into downloading from a specially crafted metalink file, this can be exploited to download files to directories outside of the intended download directory.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input sanitization of the 'name' attribute within the 'file' element of metalink files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal vulnerability",
       "Insufficient input sanitizing"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can trick a user into downloading a specially crafted metalink file, allowing them to write files to arbitrary locations on the user's system, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can craft a malicious metalink file and entice a user to download it using aria2.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute malicious metalink files. The user must be tricked into using aria2 to download the crafted file.",
      "Additional Information": "The vulnerability allows writing to arbitrary directories. The vulnerability is in the processing of the 'name' attribute of the 'file' element within metalink files, which is not properly sanitized and allows directory traversal using characters like '../'."
