```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient sanitization of the `lang_global` parameter in multiple PHP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application directly includes files based on user-supplied input without proper validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure, and in some cases, remote code execution if PHP files are included.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the `lang_global` parameter pointing to a local file on the server, prepended with a null byte (%00) to bypass file extensions checks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileged access is required."
