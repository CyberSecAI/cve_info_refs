Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1153:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The TYPO3 autoloader does not validate arguments passed to it. This lack of validation allows an attacker to manipulate the autoloader's behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Autoloader:** The core vulnerability lies in the TYPO3 autoloader's failure to sanitize or validate input arguments. Specifically, it does not properly check the source of files to be loaded, leading to the possibility of including remote files.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The autoloader does not sanitize the input arguments.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to load arbitrary PHP code from an external server and execute it on the vulnerable TYPO3 installation. This enables full control of the server, potentially leading to data breaches, defacement, or complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the TYPO3 installation. This request contains malicious input designed to trick the autoloader into loading and executing external PHP code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable TYPO3 server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Versions:** The attacker needs to know that the target is running a vulnerable version of TYPO3 (4.3.0, 4.3.1, 4.3.2 or development releases of 4.4).
- **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker requires some level of knowledge of how the TYPO3 autoloader works and how it can be exploited to include external code.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated if the following conditions are met:
   - Running a non-vulnerable version of TYPO3
    - If at least one of the PHP configuration variables `register_globals`, `allow_url_include`, is set to "off".
    - If Suhosin is in use and URL schemes are included in the `suhosin.executor.include.whitelist`
- It is stated that this vulnerability was actively exploited.
- The fix involves updating to TYPO3 4.3.3, disabling the problematic PHP settings, applying a patch, or applying a mod_security rule to block requests with external URLs.
