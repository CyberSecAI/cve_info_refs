**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1369

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `signup.asp` page of the "Pre Classified Listings" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically the `email` POST parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database by injecting malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameter.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, or even complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP POST requests.
- Specifically, the attacker manipulates the `email` parameter in a POST request to the `signup.asp` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is explicitly stated as required for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit utilizes the `email` parameter in the POST request to inject SQL code, e.g., `email=${SQLINJECTIONHERE}`.
- The provided exploit string demonstrates a typical injection point in the context of a user signup form, indicating the lack of input sanitization.
