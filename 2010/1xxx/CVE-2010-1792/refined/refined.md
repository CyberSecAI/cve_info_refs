Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2010-1792:

**Summary:**

CVE-2010-1792 is a memory corruption vulnerability within the WebKit browser engine. Specifically, it is triggered by the way WebKit handles regular expressions. Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution or unexpected application termination.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a memory corruption issue in the WebKit browser engine's handling of regular expressions. The specific flaw lies in how the engine parses or processes these expressions, resulting in memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption issue, indicating that a crafted regular expression can overwrite or corrupt memory used by WebKit.
*   **Unspecified Memory Error:** The nature of the memory corruption (heap overflow, use-after-free etc.) is not explicitly stated, however, the impact is consistent with these kind of memory corruption vulnerabilities

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Unexpected Application Termination:** In some cases, exploitation could lead to the unexpected termination (crash) of the application using WebKit.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Websites:** Attackers can embed malicious JavaScript or other web content containing crafted regular expressions on websites.
*   **Browsing:** Users can be affected by simply visiting the malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the internet, by hosting or injecting malicious content.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No specific user privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability, it can affect any user browsing a malicious webpage.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is in the WebKit browser engine, affecting all platforms that use the vulnerable version of the engine.
*   The issue stems from how WebKit processes regular expressions which can lead to memory corruption.
*   The SUSE security report indicates that this issue is fixed by an update to libwebkit.
*   The Apple security document says the issue is addressed through "improved handling of regular expressions".
*   The Ubuntu security notice states "If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could exploit a variety of issues related to web browser security, including cross-site scripting attacks, denial of service attacks, and arbitrary code execution." The notice however does not specify the root cause as related to regular expressions

**Affected Products:**

*   Multiple versions of Safari (including on Windows)
*   WebKit-based browsers on various platforms, including:
    *   openSUSE 11.3
    *   Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04, 10.10
    *   iOS 3.0 - 4.2.1 (iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch 3rd gen and later, iPad)

**Mitigation:**
*   Apply the provided updates and patches to WebKit and Safari.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided data includes multiple sources that reference the same CVE.
*   Some reports aggregate CVE-2010-1792 with many other vulnerabilities, which all impact WebKit
