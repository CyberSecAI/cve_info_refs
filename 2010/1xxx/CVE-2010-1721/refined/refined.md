Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1721:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the `id` parameter of the `com_iproperty` component for Joomla!.
*   **Weaknesses:** The component fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.
