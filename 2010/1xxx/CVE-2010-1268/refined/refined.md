Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of justVisual 2.0. Specifically, the code that processes the `p` parameter from the GET request is vulnerable. The code extracts the basename of the php file, but it also allows arbitrary file paths to be injected by manipulating the 'p' parameter. This is due to insecure handling of the input which is passed to `str_replace` to remove `.php` and then the result is used in an include or require statement allowing LFI

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is an LFI, where an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Insecure Input Handling:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `p` parameter, allowing path traversal sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive File Exposure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, and other data. This can lead to a compromise of confidentiality.
- **Possible Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly mentioned, if the attacker can include a file containing PHP code, it could potentially lead to remote code execution, depending on the server configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to `index.php` with the `p` parameter set to the path of the file to be included.
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `../../`) in the `p` parameter to access files outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific HTTP GET request with the malicious payload.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not appear to require any prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$selfname=basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'],'.php');
if(isset($_GET['p']) && !empty($_GET['p'])) {
    //$selfname=basename($_GET['p'],'.php');
    $selfname=str_replace('.php','',$_GET['p']);
```
- The PoC (Proof of Concept) provided is: `Http://127.0.0.1/index.php?p=[LFI]` where [LFI] is the path to the file to be included.
