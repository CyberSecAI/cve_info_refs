Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `com_addressbook` component of Joomla. Specifically, the `controller` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include local files by manipulating the `controller` parameter. This occurs because the component fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to specify file paths on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the LFI vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server, potentially gaining access to configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request containing the `option=com_addressbook` and a malicious `controller` parameter to a vulnerable Joomla instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Joomla web server to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **Knowledge of Joomla URLs:** The attacker must be aware of the path where the Joomla application is located, as well as the vulnerable component (`com_addressbook`).
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves manipulating the `controller` parameter in the URL.
*   An attacker can use directory traversal sequences like `../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` to read system files.
*   The null byte `%00` is used to terminate the filename, which helps bypass certain checks in the PHP code.

**Example Exploit:**

*   `http://localhost/[path]/index.php?option=com_addressbook&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

This URL demonstrates an attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file, a common target for LFI exploits.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Joomla! Component Address Book version 1.5.0.
*   The provided exploit details include the author, platform, and date of discovery which can be helpful for further investigation.

**Summary**
The Joomla! Component Address Book 1.5.0 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'controller' parameter, allowing remote attackers to read sensitive files on the server via a crafted URL request.
