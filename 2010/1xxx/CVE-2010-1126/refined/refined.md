Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1126:

**Summary:**

CVE-2010-1126 is related to a vulnerability in WebKit, and potentially other browsers (like Firefox), where the `focus()` function behavior can be exploited to inject or steal keystrokes. This is achieved by manipulating focus between different frames/windows, potentially leading to cross-domain attacks.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how browsers handle focus changes, particularly during key events and when interacting with iframes.  Specifically, the ability to programmatically shift focus using `focus()` during keyboard input and restore focus to a previous editing location could be manipulated to redirect user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Focus Changes:** The core weakness is the ability to programmatically change focus from one frame to another, and back, during user initiated key events without proper checks.
*   **Focus Restoration Issues:**  Browsers were restoring focus to the last known editing location after focus was grabbed by another document in an iframe and returned. This was not being properly reset.
*   **Cross-Origin Focus Manipulation:** An attacker could use this behavior to manipulate focus across different domains, bypassing same-origin policies.
*   **Potential for Keystroke Injection/Stealing:** The vulnerability could be leveraged to inject keystrokes into unexpected locations or steal keystrokes by redirecting user input to attacker-controlled frames/windows.
*  **Lack of checks for same-origin policy compliance:** Specifically, that a page was able to call focus() on an iframe window of a different origin while a key event was still active.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **UI Redressing:** Similar to clickjacking, the attacker can perform actions on a victim site without the user being fully aware, by focusing elements in the context of the victim website.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Bypass:** By injecting keystrokes, an attacker could bypass XSRF protections on a target site.
*   **Keystroke Stealing:** In the more serious scenario, an attacker could steal sensitive information, such as passwords, by redirecting keystrokes from the legitimate input field to an attacker-controlled location.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker crafts a malicious web page containing iframes to manipulate focus and capture user input.
*   **Iframe Injection:** Attacker could inject malicious iframes onto a legitimate site they control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host or inject web content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a web page or inject a malicious iframe into a website to execute the exploit.
*   **Understanding of focus behavior:** The attacker needs to understand how browsers handle focus changes and key events to craft the exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker would require the user to perform some interaction, such as typing in a specific area of a web page.

**Additional Information from Bugzilla:**

*   The initial report suggested that this issue was present in WebKit first, but it was then discovered it could be tweaked to work with Firefox also.
*   The issue is described in the context of cross-domain IFRAME gadgets stealing keystrokes.
*   Mitigation strategies involved preventing focus changes between onkeydown and onkeyup events, and also to not restore focus to last known editing location, but to reset it.
*   The fix involved preventing focusing a not-same-origin window during user initiated key events, or making such focus asynchronous.
*   The original proof of concept (PoC) is available publicly <http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/focus-webkit/>.
*   There was a concern about the patch breaking existing web applications.
*   The vulnerability is similar to clickjacking.
*   The issue was fixed in Firefox 3.6.5 and backported to 3.6.4 due to disclosure.
