Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2010-1152:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `memcached` server was vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to improper handling of invalid input when processing client commands. Specifically, it involved the server's logic in handling large 'get' or 'gets' commands when newline characters were missing in the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The server used `strcmp` to compare the beginning of the input buffer against "get " and "gets ". `strcmp` expects null terminated strings. If a client sent a very long string without a newline character and without a null terminator, `strcmp` would read beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Lack of Robust Command Parsing:** The server did not properly handle incomplete or malformed commands, particularly large `get` and `gets` commands that lacked a newline character, leading to a crash.
- **Missing length check:** The code did not check the length of the input before attempting to compare it against known commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could remotely crash the `memcached` server by sending specially crafted, invalid input. This would interrupt service for legitimate clients.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** A remote attacker with network access to the `memcached` server could send crafted input to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needed to be able to establish a network connection to the `memcached` server.
- **No authentication required**: The vulnerability could be triggered by any client that could connect to the server.

**Additional details:**
- The initial patch used `strcmp` which was later changed to `strncmp`. This change was to avoid reading past the end of the buffer if the input wasn't null terminated.
- The vulnerability was triggered when the server received more than 1024 bytes of input without a newline character while processing a "get" or "gets" command.
- There was a debate about whether the initial fix was sufficient, but it was updated to `strncmp` to avoid potential buffer over-reads.
