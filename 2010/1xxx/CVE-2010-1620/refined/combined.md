Ahh, I missed that one. I see it now, thanks.

Use CVE-2010-1620 for the integer overflow.

Thanks.

Note that there's a second bug in there - a potentially exploitable
integer overflow leading to heap overflow when reading a file (or
socket) with a very large number of lines, causing several malloc()
calls to underallocate space.  This should probably receive a second
CVE.

# gdomap multiple local information disclosure vulnerabilities

|  | [gnustep-base (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnustep-base "Latest release: 1.30.0-9ubuntu1, uploaded to universe on 2025-01-21 20:36:10.602185+00:00 by Gianfranco Costamagna (costamagnagianfranco), maintained by Debian GNUstep maintainers (pkg-gnustep-maintainers)") | Fix Released | Undecided | [Jamie Strandboge](https://launchpad.net/~jdstrand) |  |

### Bug Description

gdomap, part of GNUstep, is vulnerable to two different information disclosure vulnerabilities that each allow unprivileged local users to read the contents of arbitrary files.

gdomap is installed setuid root by default. When invoked with the -c (config file for probe) flag, gdomap reads a user-specified file without confirming its ownership or permissions, and then attempts to parse it as a configuration file. In a failed attempt to parse, gdomap will print an error message containing the full contents of the provided file, allowing an unprivileged local user to read anything on disk. This also occurs when gdomap is invoked with the -a (config file for interface list) flag, which uses a separate (but nearly identical) code path.

This behavior can by confirmed by:

$ gdomap -c /etc/shadow

or,

$ gdomap -a /etc/shadow

The ability to read arbitrary files on disk can easily result in privilege escalation (reading SSH keys, etc.). To mitigate the issue, permissions should be dropped to that of the invoking user prior to opening a provided configuration file.

On a second look, it appears that gdomap is no longer installed with the setuid bit on Ubuntu. I could find no mention of a change in any of the changelogs, but I assume it was installed setuid at some point in the past, since it was setuid root on my Karmic machine and I did not set it manually.

With the setuid bit unset, this no longer represents a security issue to Ubuntu, but I'm sure upstream would be interested, since gdomap is evidently intended for usage as a setuid binary in some cases, based on its documentation and code.

I just confirmed that Hardy, Jaunty, Karmic and Lucid are not affected (don't have the setuid bit set).

Dan, have you filed or are you planning to file an upstream bug?

I'd be happy to submit a report upstream later today.

Despite the fact that the gnustep-base package does not install gdomap setuid root, I suspect that other Ubuntu packages that require gdomap set this themselves, so it might be worth fixing here as well. This appears to be what happened on my system, but unfortunately I can't track down which package was responsible.

Hmm, gdomap is installed by gnutstep-base-runtime. If another package is setting its setuid bit, then that is a problem and we need to find it. Can you hold off of the upstream bug until this can be found? Dan, can you grep /var/lib/dpkg/info for the chmod of gdomap?

After much investigation, I found the problem. On installation, gnustep-base-runtime adds a statoverride of:

root root 4755 /usr/bin/gdomap

This override doesn't seem to take effect for the initial installation of this package, but if you ever reinstall it (for example with apt-get install --reinstall gnustep-base-runtime), then gdomap will be setuid root.

Unfortunately, I already submitted my upstream bug report. I'll be sure to let you know if they get back to me.

I've attached my fix here - I drop privileges to the invoking user before opening configuration files, and regain privileges afterwards.

I also put in checks to prevent a second security-relevant bug, which is a potentially exploitable integer overflow leading to heap corruption by providing a configuration file (or socket) with a very large number of lines, causing several malloc() calls to under-allocate space.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
