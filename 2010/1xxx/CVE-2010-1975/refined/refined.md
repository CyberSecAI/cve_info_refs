```
- Root cause of vulnerability: PostgreSQL does not properly check privileges during certain RESET ALL operations.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An unprivileged user can remove superuser-only parameter settings via `ALTER USER ... RESET ALL` or `ALTER DATABASE ... RESET ALL`.
- Impact of exploitation: Removal of superuser-only parameter settings for the user or database.
- Attack vectors: Executing crafted SQL commands.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Authenticated user with the ability to execute `ALTER USER ... RESET ALL` or `ALTER DATABASE ... RESET ALL` commands.
