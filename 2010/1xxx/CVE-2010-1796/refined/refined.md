The provided content is related to CVE-2010-1796.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
An implementation issue exists in Safari's AutoFill feature that allows a maliciously crafted website to trigger AutoFill without user interaction. This occurs because the AutoFill feature, which is intended to require user action to populate web forms, can be bypassed by a specially designed website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation or lack of proper checks within Safari's AutoFill implementation.
- Design flaw that doesn't prevent malicious websites from triggering autofill without explicit user consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Disclosure of information contained within the user's Address Book Card (specifically the "My Card"). This information could include name, address, phone number, email, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A maliciously crafted website that exploits the vulnerability in Safari's AutoFill feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website accessible by the victim using Safari.
- The victim must have the "Autofill web forms using info from my Address Book card" option selected in Safari's preferences and have a card designated as "My Card" in their address book.
