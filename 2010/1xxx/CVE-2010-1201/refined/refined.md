  "CVE-2010-1201": {
    "Description": "Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from an issue where the `imgContainer` object's `mFrames` array can have a length of 0, while `mNumFrames` is 1. This occurs when the `imgContainer` is initialized while `mDiscarded` is true. This leads to an out-of-bounds access when `GetFrameAt` is called.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to denial of service through browser crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted webpage that uses a multipart/x-mixed-replace image source with a low refresh rate.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious webpage."
