Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way Windows provides glyph outline information of TrueType fonts to user-mode applications. Specifically, a flaw in how the operating system handles and processes font data leads to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of TrueType font outlines.
- Insufficient validation when providing font-related information.
- The vulnerability lies within the `win32k.sys` kernel-mode driver, which is part of the Windows subsystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- **Complete System Control:** The attacker can gain full control over the affected system, leading to:
    - Installation of programs.
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
    - Creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector requires the attacker to have valid logon credentials and local access to the system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the vulnerability by exploiting the way TrueType font data is processed.
- **Potentially Remote via Third-Party Applications:** While no Microsoft applications expose this vulnerability remotely, third-party applications that parse fonts from untrusted sources could create a remote attack vector. This could allow an anonymous attacker to gain administrative privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs valid logon credentials to log on to the targeted system.
- The attacker needs the ability to run a specially crafted application on the targeted system.
- In the case of third-party apps parsing fonts, the attacker needs to provide a malicious font to a vulnerable application that runs with high privileges.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-032, along with CVE-2010-0484 and CVE-2010-0485.
- The fix involves correcting how Windows provides outlines of TrueType fonts to user-mode applications.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Windows versions, including Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7, and Server 2008 R2.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed, but there were no known reports of exploitation in the wild at the time of the security bulletin's release.
- The advisory mentions that workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk.

**Summary:** CVE-2010-1255 is an important elevation of privilege vulnerability affecting the way Windows processes TrueType fonts. It can lead to complete system compromise if exploited, especially on systems where users can run applications. The most common attack scenario involves local execution, but there is a potential risk for remote exploitation via vulnerable third-party applications, as well.
