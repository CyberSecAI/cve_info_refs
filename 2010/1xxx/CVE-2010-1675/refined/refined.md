{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) improperly handles malformed AS_PATHLIMIT attributes within BGP Update messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed AS_PATHLIMIT attributes in BGP Update messages."
    ],
    "impact": "Processing a BGP Update message with a malformed AS-path attribute can cause the bgpd daemon to reset the BGP session, leading to a denial of service and disrupting packet forwarding. This can affect all systems the message travels through, not just direct peers, creating a distributed reset vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote BGP peer can send a crafted BGP Update message containing a malformed AS_PATHLIMIT attribute.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a configured BGP peer or have the ability to inject a malicious BGP Update message into the network."
  }
