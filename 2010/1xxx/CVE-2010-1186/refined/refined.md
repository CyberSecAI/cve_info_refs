  "CVE-2010-1186": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the NextGEN Gallery WordPress plugin due to insufficient sanitization of the 'mode' parameter in the 'xml/media-rss.php' script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The 'mode' parameter in the 'xml/media-rss.php' script is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of HTML code.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious URL that includes a script in the 'mode' parameter of the 'xml/media-rss.php' script."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a URL with a malicious script in the 'mode' parameter. No special access is needed; the vulnerability can be triggered remotely on any WordPress installation with the vulnerable plugin installed.",
       "affected_versions": [
        "NextGEN Gallery 1.5.0",
        "NextGEN Gallery 1.5.1",

      ],
      "fixed_versions": [
        "NextGEN Gallery 1.5.2"
      ],
    "additional_notes": "Some browsers, like Internet Explorer, might interpret the content type based on the content rather than the server header.  The exploit-db entry provides detailed technical description and proof of concept code. The advisory also notes that while the plugin sets the content-type header, it's not sufficient to prevent code injection in some browsers."
