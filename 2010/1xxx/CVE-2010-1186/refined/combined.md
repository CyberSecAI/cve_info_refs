How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

XSS Vulnerability in NextGEN Gallery Wordpress Plugin

1. Advisory Information

	Title: XSS Vulnerability in NextGEN Gallery Wordpress Plugin
	Advisory Id: CORE-2010-0323
	Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/nextgen-gallery-xss-vulnerability
	Date published: 2010-04-06
	Date of last update: 2010-03-25
	Vendors contacted: Alex Rabe
	Release mode: Coordinated release

2. Vulnerability Information

	Class: Cross site scripting [CWE-79]
	Impact: Code execution
	Remotely Exploitable: Yes
	Locally Exploitable: No
	Bugtraq ID: N/A
	CVE Name: CVE-2010-1186

3. Vulnerability Description

	An XSS[1] vulneravility has been discovered in NextGEN Gallery[2], a very popular and commonly used plugin for the Wordpress content management system commonly found as a blogging platform. This vulnerability results from reflected unsanitized imput that can be crafted into an attack by a malicious user by manipulating the mode parameter of the xml/media-rss.php script.

4. Vulnerable packages

    * NextGEN Gallery 1.5.0
    * NextGEN Gallery 1.5.1
    * Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. Non-vulnerable packages

    * NextGEN Gallery 1.5.2

6. Solutions and Workarounds

	On the server side, you can upgrade to a non-vulnerable version. Onthe client you can use a browser that obeys the Content-Type header specified by the server, such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari or Opera. Internet Explorer 8 with the XSS Filter won't execute the malicious scripts.

7. Credits

	These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Alejandro Rodriguez, from Core Security Technologies, during Core Bugweek 2009 as a member of the "Los Herederos de Don Pablo (HDP)" team.

8. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

	This vulerablity is triggered because the mode parameter on the media-rss.php script is not correctly escaped to avoid HTML code injection.

		$mode = $_GET["mode"];

	This parameter is reflected back to the user if no correct mode is selected:

		} else { header('content-type:text/plain;charset=utf-8'); echo sprintf(__("Invalid MediaRSS command (%s).","nggallery"), $mode); exit; }

	Its worth to note that the Content-Type is chosen safely by the plugin, but this is note enough to avoid code injection because some browsers (most notably Microsoft Internet Explorer) choose the content type by parsing the content the web-server returns instead of obeying the proper headers.

	This vulnerability can be triggered on any Wordpress instalation with the NextGEN Gallery extension installed by visiting the following URL on a browser with this issue. If using IE 8 the XSS Filter must be turned off.
http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/nextgen-gallery/xml/media-rss.php?mode=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

9. Report Timeline

    * 2010-03-25: Core Security Technologies notifies Alex Rabe of the vulnerability, offering a draft for this advisory in plaintext or encrypted form (if proper keys are sent). April 5th, 2010, is proposed as a release date.
    * 2010-03-25: Alex Rabe acknowledges Core Security Technologies's e-mail, and asks for the advisory draft in plain text.
    * 2010-03-25: Core Security Technologies sends the advisory draft to Alex Rabe.
    * 2010-03-25: Alex Rabe acknowledges the vulneravility, confirms it for NextGEN Gallery 1.5.0 and 1.5.1, and informs than 1.5.2 (due to be released on March 26th) will contain a fix.
    * 2010-03-26: NextGEN Gallery 1.5.2 is released.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## FAQ

### Why are my photo galleries not opening up in a lightbox after I move my site?

This is often due to the URL paths to the CSS and JavaScript files used by the Lightbox Effects not being changed to relevant addresses based on the new site. This article will help sort out this issue if that is the case: [Why are my galleries not opening up in a lightbox?](https://www.imagely.com/docs/galleries-opening-lightbox/).

### Do you have documentation or tutorials?

Yes. See [NextGEN Gallery Documentation](https://www.imagely.com/docs/).

### Will this gallery plugin work with my theme?

Yup, NextGEN is a popular and well-established WordPress gallery plugin, and has been for a long time. It will work well with most other themes and plugins in the WordPress ecosystem.

### Are the photo galleries flash based?

Nope, we do not use flash elements.

### Are the galleries mobile friendly?

Yes, we’ve put a lot of work into this and, NextGEN Galleries are compatible with phones and tablets, inluding Android and iOS operating systems. All photo galleries are also responsive, so galleries look good on diverse screen sizes. NextGEN Pro also includes a fullscreen, responsive Pro Lightbox with mobile gesture support. It’s great for viewing photos on mobile devices.

### What is the difference between a gallery and an album?

In simple terms, Albums are collections of galleries. So Galleries contain your photos and Albums contain your Galleries. Albums act as links and placeholders to quickly and easily navigate your galleries. Galleries will actually display your images.

### Can I upload multiple images at once?

Yes, you can batch upload entire photo galleries at one time or even include zip folders.

### Can I password protect galleries?

Yes, WordPress allows you to password protect pages by default – which includes all photo galleries and content for the entire page. Password protection pages can be turned on and off at any time, with just a few clicks.

Yes, you can add text or image watermarks to your gallery images.

### Can I crop photo thumbnails?

Yes, each thumbnail image can be individually adjusted to suit your needs.

### Is there pagination for photo galleries?

Yes, you can use pagination when displaying thumbnail galleries. You can adjust the amount of photos to be shown on a page at any time.

### Can I customize the lightbox?

Yes, the lightbox can be configured with multiple options directly from the Dashboard, and there are multiple CSS styles, which can be applied and modified as well. If you want even more options, consider upgrading to NextGEN Pro and using the NextGEN Pro lightbox.

### Can I add HTML to photo captions?

Yes, caption areas are fully HMTL capable.

### Can I add an external links to galleries?

Since the captions are fully HTML capable, you can add external links and any other type of markup you wish.

Some functions are difficult to find, especially when you don’t use the plugin frequently, such as find the code of a gallery to be inserted in the page, or add photos toan existing gallery.Nevertheless, the app remains easy to use.

I’ve been using it to share high quality pictures of our work on our website and it’s been great because it doesn’t make the page boggy and slow to load. Definitely recommend.

After bouncing around looking for THE plugin for my photography, I came across this. It was straightforward to configure and I received immediate help when I had a couple of snags when configuring checkout. I’d love to see a few enhancements to the pricelist end of things and also preventing an order to go straight to a lab without approval and replacement of an image. I am also planning on setting this plugin up on another website I maintain. The search by tag is fantastic and very useful for photography groups that have competitions.
