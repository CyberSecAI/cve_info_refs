Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2010-1551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `_OVParseLLA` function within `ov.dll`, which is called by `netmon.exe`.
- When `_OVParseLLA` is called, it directly copies the value of the `sel` POST variable into a fixed-length stack buffer using `strcpy()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The use of `strcpy()` without any bounds checking leads to a buffer overflow vulnerability.  If the attacker provides a `sel` POST variable value that is larger than the fixed-length stack buffer, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This code executes with the privileges of the webserver process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `webappmon.exe` CGI application, which triggers the vulnerable code in `netmon.exe`. The `sel` parameter is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable HP OpenView NNM instance.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can directly send malicious requests to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects HP OpenView Network Node Manager versions 7.01, 7.51, and 7.53.
- HP released patches to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a filter with ID '9271'.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher working with the TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
