# Advisory Details

May 11th, 2010
## HP OpenView NNM netmon sel CGI Variable Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-082ZDI-CAN-564

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-1551](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1551) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Hewlett-Packard](http://www.hp.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [OpenView Network Node Manager](https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp?zn=bto&cp=1-11-15-119^1155_4000_100) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9271']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the Network Monitor (netmon.exe) daemon. This process can be started by invoking the webappmon.exe CGI application through the webserver. When the \_OVParseLLA function defined within ov.dll is called from netmon.exe it directly copies the value of the 'sel' POST variable into a fixed-length stack buffer with a call to strcpy(). This can be leveraged by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the webserver process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2009-10-21 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-05-11 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
