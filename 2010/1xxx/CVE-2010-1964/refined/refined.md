  "CVE-2010-1964": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ovwebsnmpsrv.exe` process when handling overly large values passed through an HTTP request to the `jovgraph.exe` CGI program. Specifically, a `strcpy` call within the `main()` function overflows a static buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow in strcpy function",
        "Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Network Node Manager under the context of the user running the webserver.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the jovgraph.exe CGI program.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to send a specially crafted HTTP request containing overly large values for specific variables."
