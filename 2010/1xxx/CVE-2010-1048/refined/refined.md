The provided content relates to **CVE-2010-1048**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the Uiga Business Portal application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `noentryid` parameter in the `blog/index.php` and the `p` parameter in `index2.php`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries into the application.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks via the comment box, allowing the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **SQL Injection:**
    - An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data, including user credentials (usernames and passwords) from the `tbl_user` table and admin credentials from the `admin` table.
    - An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - An attacker can potentially inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
    - This can be used to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection:**
    - Crafted URLs with malicious SQL queries injected into the `noentryid` and `p` parameters.
    - Example URL for user SQLi: `http://server/ulgabusinessportak/blog/index.php?view=noentryid&noentryid=-20+Union+All+Select+1,2,3,4,5,group_concat(user_id,0x3a,username,0x3a,password),7,8,9,10+from+tbl_user--`
    - Example URL for admin SQLi: `http://server/ulgabusinessportak/index2.php?c=29&p=-45+Union+All+Select 1,group_concat(admin_id,0x3a,admin_name,0x3a,admin_password),3,4,5+from+admin--`
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - Malicious scripts injected into the comment box when adding or editing a comment.
    - Example: Inject `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` into the portal using the Comment Box.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable application through a web browser.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit these vulnerabilities, as the injection occurs through publicly accessible areas of the web application.
- No authentication is required to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities, while XSS attack requires an attacker to post a comment, which is generally publicly accessible.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit details mention the vulnerable application is "Uiga Business Portal" by "scriptdevelopers.net".
- The vulnerability was tested on a Linux environment (Cent OS 5.4 with Apache/2.2.3 and MYSQL v5.0.77) and Windows environment (Windows XPsp2 with Wamp).
- The exploit provides specific examples of SQL injection payloads to retrieve user and admin credentials.
- The Exploit-DB entry also cross-references CVE-2010-1049 but this analysis is specific to the content related to CVE-2010-1048.
