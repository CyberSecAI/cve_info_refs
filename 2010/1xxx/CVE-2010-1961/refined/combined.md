# Advisory Details

## Hewlett-Packard OpenView NNM ovutil.dll getProxiedStorageAddress Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-106ZDI-CAN-685

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-1961](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1961) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Hewlett-Packard](http://www.hp.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [OpenView Network Node Manager](https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp?zn=bto&cp=1-11-15-119^1155_4000_100) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9283']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the ovutil.dll module which is loaded by the ovwebsnmpsrv.exe process which in turn can be reached remotely through the jovgraph.exe CGI program. By supplying overly large values to variables passed through an HTTP request a sprintf can be made to overflow a static buffer. An attacker can leverage this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the webserver. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c02217439> |
