1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- clamav
clamav was updated to version 0.96.5 to fix denial of service
problems (CVE-2010-4479, CVE-2010-4260, CVE-2010-4261)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- subversion
The SVNPathAuthz short\_circuit option allowed remote attackers to
bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2010-3315).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- python
a race condition in the accept() implementation of smtpd.py could
lead to a denial of service (CVE-2010-3493).
integer overflows and insufficient size checks could crash the
audioop module (CVE-2010-2089, CVE-2010-1634).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit that to
modify or forge messages (CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020,
CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.5](/security/cves?package=python2.5) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.5)

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* [python2.6](/security/cves?package=python2.6) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [msg105434](#msg105434) - [(view)](msg105434) | Author: Tomas Hoger (thoger) | Date: 2010-05-10 13:43 |
| ``` SVN commit [r64114](https://hg.python.org/lookup/r64114) added integer overflow checks to multiple modules.  Checks added to audioop module are incorrect and can still be bypassed:  <http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Modules/audioop.c?r1=64114&r2=64113>  - audioop_tostereo - should be fine, but relies on undefined behaviour - audioop_lin2lin - undetected overflow: size=1, size2=4, len=0x40000001 - audioop_ratecv - undetected overflow: nchannels=0x5fffffff (32bit) - audioop_ulaw2lin - undetected overflow: size=4, len=0x40000001 - audioop_alaw2lin - same as audioop_ulaw2lin - audioop_adpcm2lin - undetected overflow: size=4, len=0x20000001  Most of these are triggered by large fragment as an input.  Attached patch replaces checks added in [r64114](https://hg.python.org/lookup/r64114) by checks using INT_MAX. ``` | | | |
| [msg105437](#msg105437) - [(view)](msg105437) | Author: Mark Dickinson (mark.dickinson) \* (Python committer) | Date: 2010-05-10 14:44 |
| ``` Thanks for the patch.  I agree that undefined behaviour (e.g., from signed overflow) should be avoided where at all possible.  Do you have any Python examples that failed to trigger the overflow on your platform?  If so, it would be useful to add them to [Lib/test/test_audioop.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/test/test_audioop.py) as extra testcases.  One other question:  is there something about the formats that audioop is dealing with that limits sizes to INT_MAX (rather than PY_SSIZE_T_MAX, for example)?  I'm not really familiar with audio formats.  As an aside, I also find it strange that the code raises MemoryError in these cases, since these exceptions can be raised even when there's plenty of memory available.  IMO MemoryError should only be raised as a result of a failed attempt to allocate memory from the system.  Some other exception---perhaps OverflowError---would seem more appropriate here. ``` | | | |
| [msg105438](#msg105438) - [(view)](msg105438) | Author: Mark Dickinson (mark.dickinson) \* (Python committer) | Date: 2010-05-10 14:48 |
| ``` Unless you have an explicit exploit, I think the 'type' should be 'behavior' rather than 'security'. ``` | | | |
| [msg105441](#msg105441) - [(view)](msg105441) | Author: Mark Dickinson (mark.dickinson) \* (Python committer) | Date: 2010-05-10 15:05 |
| ``` Okay, it looks to me as though all those 'int' lengths should really be 'Py_ssize_t'.  I don't think that's something we can change in 2.6, though;  probably not in 2.7 either, since we're getting too close to the release.  It can and should be changed in py3k, though.  I'll review this patch and (assuming it looks good) apply it to the 2.x branches.  It would be great to have some tests, though. ``` | | | |
| [msg105443](#msg105443) - [(view)](msg105443) | Author: Tomas Hoger (thoger) | Date: 2010-05-10 15:21 |
| ``` > Do you have any Python examples that failed to trigger the overflow > on your platform?  No, I've not really tried to create some, as I found it while looking into similar checks added to rgbimg module (which is dead and removed upstream now) in the same commit [r64114](https://hg.python.org/lookup/r64114).  Having another close look, I can reproduce crash with lin2lin:   audioop.lin2lin("A"*0x40000001, 1, 4)  ratecv may cause issues too.  Other cases use for loop with multiplication product as an upper bound, so the integer overflow should be harmless in those case.  > is there something about the formats that audioop is dealing > with that limits sizes to INT_MAX (rather than PY_SSIZE_T_MAX, > for example)?  I've started looking into this on oldish python 2.4, where PyString_FromStringAndSize accepts int size, rather than Py_ssize_t.  Rest of the audioop code was using ints too.  It's possible it is ok to more to size_t in current python version. ``` | | | |
| [msg105449](#msg105449) - [(view)](msg105449) | Author: Mark Dickinson (mark.dickinson) \* (Python committer) | Date: 2010-05-10 17:16 |
| ``` Yes, writing portable tests turns out to be tricky;  I also don't want to write tests based on int that'll fail when/if Py_ssize_t is substituted.  Applied the patch (with a couple of minor changes) in [r81045](https://hg.python.org/lookup/r81045) through [r81048](https://hg.python.org/lookup/r81048).  I'll open another issue for the int->Py_ssize_t changes.  Thanks again for the patch! ``` | | | |
| [msg105509](#msg105509) - [(view)](msg105509) | Author: Mark Dickinson (mark.dickinson) \* (Python committer) | Date: 2010-05-11 13:11 |
| ``` Fixed one more bogus overflow check in [r81079](https://hg.python.org/lookup/r81079) through [r81082](https://hg.python.org/lookup/r81082). ``` | | | |

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks.

An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances.

This update adds the '-R' command line option and honors setting the

PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to 'random' to salt str and datetime

objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](/security/CVE-2012-1150))

Serhiy Storchaka discovered that the UTF16 decoder in Python did not

properly reset internal variables after error handling. An attacker could

exploit this to cause a denial of service via memory corruption.

([CVE-2012-2135](/security/CVE-2012-2135))

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [python2.4](/security/cves?package=python2.4) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language (version 2.4)

## Details

USN-1613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Python 2.5. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Python 2.4.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path

under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the

current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2008-5983](/security/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input

validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a

crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2010-1634](/security/CVE-2010-1634), [CVE-2010-2089](/security/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via

daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](/security/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform

input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could

potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](/security/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process

Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1521](/security/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in

the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7

users. ([CVE-2011-4940](/security/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when

creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](/security/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its

input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization.

([CVE-2012-0845](/security/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values

without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If

a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive

CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](/security/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly

handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or

application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory

resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](/security/CVE-2012-1148))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
