  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-1653",
      "root_cause": "The `controller` parameter in the `com_graphics` component of Joomla is vulnerable to local file inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsanitized input to `require_once` function",
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure, code execution, or other malicious activities depending on the files accessed and their content.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `controller` parameter in the URL.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.",
     "details": "The vulnerability lies in the `graphics.php` file of the `com_graphics` component, where the `controller` parameter from the request is used directly within a `require_once` function without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject a file path (using directory traversal), leading to the inclusion of local files. By injecting paths like `../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`, the attacker can attempt to read system files, potentially obtaining sensitive information."
