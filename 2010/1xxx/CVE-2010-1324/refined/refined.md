  "CVE-2010-1324": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in MIT Kerberos 5. An unauthenticated remote attacker can forge GSS tokens that are intended to be integrity-protected but unencrypted, if the targeted pre-existing application session uses a DES session key. An authenticated remote attacker can forge PACs if using a KDC that does not filter client-provided PAC data. This can result in privilege escalation against a service that relies on PAC contents to make authorization decisions. An unauthenticated remote attacker has a 1/256 chance of swapping a client-issued KrbFastReq into a different KDC-REQ, if the armor key is RC4. The consequences are believed to be minor.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause lies in the incorrect handling of checksums within the Kerberos protocol. Specifically, the MIT krb5 implementation accepts unkeyed checksums where keyed checksums are required, and incorrectly uses key-derivation checksums with RC4 keys.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect checksum verification: The implementation fails to properly validate the type and integrity of checksums within various Kerberos messages.",
        "Use of low-entropy keys: The usage of RC4 keys for key derivation leads to the potential for forging valid messages, as the derived keys are predictable.",
          "Acceptance of unkeyed checksums: In multiple situations the Kerberos implementation accepts unkeyed checksums when keyed checksums are required."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could:\n\n*   Forge GSS tokens intended for integrity-protected but unencrypted sessions (using DES keys).\n*   Forge PACs, leading to potential privilege escalation, if the KDC doesn't filter client-provided PACs.\n*   Potentially swap a client-issued KrbFastReq into a different KDC-REQ (1/256 probability if RC4 is used).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based: An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities through network traffic directed at vulnerable Kerberos services or implementations.",
        "Man-in-the-middle (MITM): An attacker could potentially intercept and modify Kerberos messages to forge tokens or authorization data.",
        "Malicious Client: An attacker in control of a client can forge data in Kerberos authentication protocols."

      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs:\n\n*   To be able to send network traffic to the affected Kerberos service or implementation.\n*   To have a legitimate service principal to exploit some vulnerabilities.\n*   To potentially intercept and manipulate Kerberos messages."
