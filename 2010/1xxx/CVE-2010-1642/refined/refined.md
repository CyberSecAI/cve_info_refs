{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `reply_sesssetup_and_X_spnego` function of the Samba daemon (smbd). This function incorrectly uses a provided security blob length, without validating if the provided length exceeds the actual packet length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Incorrect input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read, causing a denial of service by crashing the smbd process handling their connection. This crash is limited to the specific connection and does not affect the overall availability of the Samba service, because new child smbd processes are forked off for new connections.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted Session Setup AndX request containing a security blob length that exceeds the size of the actual provided data.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs the ability to send a malformed SMB request, which implies the attacker has network access to the Samba service."
