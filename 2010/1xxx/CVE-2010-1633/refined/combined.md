| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=598732#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-01 22:51:34 UTC  ``` From the upstream advisory [1]:  Invalid Return value check in pkey_rsa_verifyrecover ====================================================  When verification recovery fails for RSA keys an uninitialised buffer with an undefined length is returned instead of an error code ([CVE-2010-1633](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1633)).  This bug is only present in OpenSSL 1.0.0 and only affects applications that call the function EVP_PKEY_verify_recover(). As this function is not present in previous versions of OpenSSL and not used by OpenSSL internal code very few applications should be affected. The OpenSSL utility application "pkeyutl" does  use this function.  Affected users should update to 1.0.0a which contains a patch to correct this bug.  Thanks to Peter-Michael Hager for reporting this issue.  [1] <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20100601.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=598732#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-06-01 22:53:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable.
