Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1633:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an invalid return value check within the `pkey_rsa_verifyrecover` function in OpenSSL.
*   Specifically, when verification recovery fails for RSA keys, the function returns an uninitialized buffer with an undefined length instead of an error code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak. When `EVP_PKEY_verify_recover()` fails, the uninitialized buffer contains potentially sensitive information that could be exposed to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information present in the uninitialized memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when an application calls the `EVP_PKEY_verify_recover()` function on RSA keys where verification recovery fails.
*   The OpenSSL utility "pkeyutl" uses the affected function and could be an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger the `EVP_PKEY_verify_recover()` function with a situation where verification recovery would fail.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges other than the ability to execute code using OpenSSL libraries.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present only in OpenSSL version 1.0.0.
*   It is stated that very few applications should be affected because the `EVP_PKEY_verify_recover()` function was introduced in 1.0.0 and is not used internally by OpenSSL.
*   The fix involves correcting the error handling within the `pkey_rsa_verifyrecover` function to return an appropriate error code instead of the uninitialized buffer.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5 were not affected by this vulnerability due to using earlier versions of OpenSSL.
*   The fix was included in OpenSSL 1.0.0a
