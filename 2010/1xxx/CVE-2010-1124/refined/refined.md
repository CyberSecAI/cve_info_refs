- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability occurs due to the program copying the reference to the address returned by `getaddrinfo` instead of copying the actual contents of the address. This leads to a dangling pointer if the memory allocated by `getaddrinfo` is freed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect handling of memory addresses returned by `getaddrinfo`.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The impact is a core dump in affected programs. Specifically, it can cause DB2 instances to crash intermittently, especially when databases are cataloged with alternate servers using IP addresses.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a program uses the address returned by `getaddrinfo` after it is freed. This is not a remotely exploitable vulnerability but a coding error.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within a program running on the affected AIX system, and cause the program to access the freed memory. This might not be a direct attack vector, rather a vulnerability within a program that can be triggered by the right condition.
