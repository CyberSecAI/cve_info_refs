The provided content is a security advisory from typo3.org, specifically **TYPO3-SA-2010-006**, which details multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party TYPO3 extensions. This content is directly related to CVE-2010-1004, as it is mentioned in the CVE description that it refers to multiple vulnerabilities in third party extensions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause varies depending on the extension, but generally includes:
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied data in SQL queries, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inadequate encoding of user-supplied data, leading to the injection of malicious scripts into web pages.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Flaws in the authentication mechanism, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The document identifies the following vulnerabilities in specific third-party extensions:

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Brainstorming (brainstorming)
    *   Educator (educator)
    *   MK Wastebasket (mk\_wastebasket) - Blind SQL Injection
    *   CleanDB (nf\_cleandb) - Blind SQL Injection
    *   Diocese of Portsmouth Database (pd\_diocesedatabase)
    *   SAV Filter Alphabetic (sav\_filter\_abc)
    *   SAV Filter Selectors (sav\_filter\_selectors)
    *   SAV Filter Months (sav\_filter\_months)
    *    Simple Gallery (sk\_simplegallery)
    *  TGM-Newsletter (tgm\_newsletter)
    *    CleanDB - DBAL (tmsw\_cleandb) - Blind SQL Injection
    *     YATSE - Yet another TYPO3 search engine (yatse)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Sellector.com Widget Integration (chsellector)
    *   myDashboard (mydashboard)
    *   Reports Logfile View (reports\_logview)
     * Simple Gallery (sk\_simplegallery)
    *    Typo3 Quixplorer (t3quixplorer)
    *   UserTask Center, recent (taskcenter\_recent)
     * TGM-Newsletter (tgm\_newsletter)
    * YATSE - Yet another TYPO3 search engine (yatse)

*  **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   TYPO3 Security - Salted user password hashes (t3sec\_saltedpw)

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Power Extension Manager (ch\_lightem)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact varies depending on the vulnerability:
*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to read, modify, or delete database data, potentially gaining complete control over the application and server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, allowing them to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Information Disclosure:** May reveal sensitive information about the system or users to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors depend on the vulnerability type:
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can exploit vulnerable input fields or parameters in web requests to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts through user input fields, vulnerable parameters in URLs or stored user generated content.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Attackers can exploit flaws in the login mechanism to bypass authentication.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can access files containing sensitive information via public paths

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For most SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker typically needs to be able to send crafted requests to the web server, often through a web browser or a custom tool.
*   For authentication bypass, the attacker needs to be able to interact with the authentication mechanism.
*   For information disclosure, the attacker usually needs to have some knowledge of the system's file structure.

The document also provides remediation advice:

*   **Updates:**  For some extensions, updated versions are available on the TYPO3 Extension Repository.
*   **Removal:** For extensions where no update is available or the author is unresponsive, the recommendation is to uninstall and delete the extension.

The advisory stresses the importance of keeping extensions up-to-date and subscribing to the typo3-announce mailing list to stay informed about security updates.
