      "root_cause": "The ovwebsnmpsrv.exe process does not properly handle unrecognized command line options. An overly large unrecognized option provided through an HTTP request causes an overflow in a static buffer when creating an error message.",

        "Remote exploitation via HTTP request to the jovgraph.exe CGI program."
