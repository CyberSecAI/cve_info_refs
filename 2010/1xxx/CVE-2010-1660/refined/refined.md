Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `help-details.php` script of CLScript.com Classifieds Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`hpId` parameter in `help-details.php`) before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Exposure:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., database version) by using `UNION SELECT` statements.
*   **Potential Data Modification/Manipulation:** Although the provided exploit focuses on data extraction, a successful SQL injection could potentially allow attackers to modify or delete data from the database, if the database user used by the application allows those actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `hpId` parameter in the `help-details.php` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to construct malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit example provided by exploit-db uses a simple `UNION SELECT` query to extract the database version:
    `http://example.com/help-details.php?hpId=-38+union+select+all+1,version(),3,4,5,6,7--`
