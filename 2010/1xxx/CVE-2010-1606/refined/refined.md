- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - **Authentication Bypass**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection which allows an attacker to bypass authentication by using the string `' or 1=1 or ''='` in both the username and password fields.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The application is vulnerable to XSS in the search functionality, due to insufficient input sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - SQL Injection (for authentication bypass).
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Authentication bypass**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the application.
    - **XSS**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Authentication bypass**: Through the login form using SQL injection techniques.
    - **XSS**: Through the search field, by injecting malicious JavaScript code in the query string.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to access the login form and the search field of the vulnerable application.
    - For XSS, the attacker would likely craft a link that contains the malicious payload and trick a victim into visiting the link.
