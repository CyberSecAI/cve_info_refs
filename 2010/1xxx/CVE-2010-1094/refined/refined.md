Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1094:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content from Exploit-DB explicitly references CVE-2010-1094.
*   The exploit details align with a SQL injection vulnerability.
*   Therefore, the content is related to CVE-2010-1094.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `news.php` file of the "DZ Erotik Auktionshaus" application.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `id` parameter of the `news.php` script.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into an SQL query.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
*   **Database Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `news.php` script and injecting SQL commands within the `id` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to know how to write SQL queries to retrieve or manipulate database information.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit example provided in Exploit-DB demonstrates a `UNION SELECT` based SQL injection to retrieve user credentials:

    ```
    www.site.com/auktionshaus/news.php?id=null+union+select+1,2,concat(name,0x3a,password),4,5+from+users#
    ```
    *   `null`: This ensures that no records are returned from the original query, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   `union select`: This allows the attacker to craft a separate query to extract data.
    *   `1,2,concat(name,0x3a,password),4,5`: These are placeholder values in the select statement, the `concat` statement here retrieves the user's name and password separated by a colon.
    *   `from users`:  This specifies the table to extract data from.
    *   `#`: This comments out any remaining part of the query.
*   The injection occurs in the `id` parameter within `news.php` script

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `news.php` file of the "DZ Erotik Auktionshaus" application, where the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized. This allows attackers to potentially extract database information.
