Based on the provided content, here's what can be extracted regarding CVE-2010-1926:

*   **Vulnerability:** OpenCourrier 2.03beta - Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
*   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to file inclusion, allowing an attacker to include local or remote files. The vulnerability is located in multiple files, specifically, the `path_om` parameter in multiple `.class.php` files and the `dsn[phptype]` parameter in `scr/soustab.php`.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **RFI:** By manipulating the `path_om` parameter in various `.class.php` files to include a remote file (e.g., a shell).
    *   **LFI:** By manipulating the `dsn[phptype]` parameter in `scr/soustab.php` to include a local file. Null byte injection (`%00`) is used to truncate the file path.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **RFI:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a remotely hosted malicious file.
    *   **LFI:** Allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the server.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the server's file structure for LFI, or a server to host their malicious file for RFI.
*   **Vulnerable parameters:** `path_om` and `dsn[phptype]`
