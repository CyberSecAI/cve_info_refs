How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Impact: A maliciously crafted URL may be obfuscated, making phishing attacks more effective

  Description: Safari supports the inclusion of user information in URLs, which allows the URL to specify a username and password to authenticate the user to the named server. These URLs are often used to confuse users, which can potentially aid phishing attacks. Safari is updated to display a warning before navigating to an HTTP or HTTPS URL containing user information. Credit to Abhishek Arya of Google, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1723

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: A maliciously crafted website may control the displayed website URL while a certificate warning is displayed

  Description: When Safari reaches a website via a 302 redirection and a certificate warning is displayed, the URL bar will contain the original website URL instead of the current website URL. This may allow a maliciously crafted website that is reached via an open redirector on a user-trusted website to control the displayed website URL while a certificate warning is displayed. This issue is addressed by returning the correct URL in the underlying CFNetwork layer. Credit to Kevin Day of Your.Org, and Jason Mueller of Indiana University for reporting this issue.

* **Settings**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1756

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: A user may be misled as to the actual operational wireless network

  Description: A design issue exists in the Settings application. When connected a hidden wireless network, the Settings application may incorrectly indicate another wireless network. This issue is addressed by properly displaying the active wireless network. Credit to Wilfried Teiken for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2195

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in WebKit's parsing of floating point numbers. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. The issue is addressed through improved bounds checking. Credit: Apple.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2816

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in unexpected actions on other websites

  Description: An issue exists in WebKit's implementation of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Before allowing a page from one origin to access a resource in another origin, WebKit sends a preflight request to the latter server for access to the resource. WebKit includes custom HTTP headers specified by the requesting page in the preflight request. This can facilitate cross-site request forgery. This issue is addressed by removing custom HTTP headers from preflight requests. Credit: Apple.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0544

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
