Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the direct accessibility of the database file (`lebisoft.mdb`) through a predictable URL. The application fails to restrict access to sensitive files, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the database file, which likely contains sensitive information about the application, including user data, configuration settings, and potentially other confidential details.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The web application lacks proper access controls to prevent direct access to the database file via a web request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can download the database file, gaining access to all the sensitive information contained within.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The leaked database credentials or other sensitive information could be used to launch further attacks, such as SQL injection attempts or other forms of privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct URL Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the database file using its predictable URL (`http://127.0.0.1/LebisoftZiyaretciDefteri_v7.5/db/lebisoft.mdb` or a similar path based on the installation).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know or discover the path to the database file. This is usually easy if the path naming is predictable.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit details mention the specific file path, which confirms the vulnerability is due to direct access to the database file
* The application is identified as "Lebi soft Ziyaretci Defteri_v7.5" using ASP.
* The vulnerability was tested on "windows SP2 Fran√ßais V.(Pnx2 2.0) IIS 5.0"
