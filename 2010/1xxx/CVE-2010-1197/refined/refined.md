{
  "CVE-2010-1197": {
    "Description": "The 'Content-Disposition: attachment' HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present. Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site scripting attacks.",
    "Root cause": "The browser ignored the 'Content-Disposition: attachment' HTTP header when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The browser incorrectly prioritizes the 'Content-Type: multipart' header over the 'Content-Disposition: attachment' header, which can cause the browser to render the content inline instead of treating it as an attachment."
    ],
    "Impact": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Attackers can upload malicious files with attacker-controlled Content-Type headers, tricking users into executing the malicious code.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious website can exploit the flaw by using multipart content with a Content-Type header set to 'text/html', bypassing the intended attachment behavior, and causing the browser to render the content inline instead of prompting a download.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs a platform where users can upload arbitrary files and specify Content-Type, while the platform tries to force download by setting the Content-Disposition header to attachment."
