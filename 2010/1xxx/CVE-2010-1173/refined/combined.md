Debian Bug(s)  : 573071

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4537

    Fabian Yamaguchi reported a missing check for Ethernet frames larger
    than the MTU in the r8169 driver. This may allow users on the local
    network to crash a system, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-0727

    Sachin Prabhu reported an issue in the GFS2 filesystem. Local users
    can trigger a BUG() altering the permissions on a locked file,
    resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1083

    Linus Torvalds reported an issue in the USB subsystem, which may allow
    local users to obtain portions of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-1084

    Neil Brown reported an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem that may
    permit remote attackers to overwrite memory through the creation
    of large numbers of sockets, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1086

    Ang Way Chuang reported an issue in the DVB subsystem for Digital
    TV adapters. By creating a specially-encoded MPEG2-TS frame, a remote
    attacker could cause the receiver to enter an endless loop, resulting
    in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1087

    Trond Myklebust reported an issue in the NFS filesystem. A local
    user may cause an oops by sending a fatal signal during a file
    truncation operation, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1088

    Al Viro reported an issue where automount symlinks may not
    be followed when LOOKUP_FOLLOW is not set. This has an unknown
    security impact.

CVE-2010-1162

    Catalin Marinas reported an issue in the tty subsystem that allows
    local attackers to cause a kernel memory leak, possibly resulting
    in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1173

    Chris Guo from Nokia China and Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva from
    Codenomicon Ltd reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that allows
    a remote attacker to cause a denial of service using a malformed init
    package.

CVE-2010-1187

    Neil Hormon reported an issue in the TIPC subsystem. Local users can
    cause a denial of service by way of a NULL pointer dereference by
    sending datagrams through AF_TIPC before entering network mode.

CVE-2010-1437

    Toshiyuki Okajima reported a race condition in the keyring subsystem.
    Local users can cause memory corruption via keyctl commands that
    access a keyring in the process of being deleted, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2010-1446

    Wufei reported an issue with kgdb on the PowerPC architecture,
    allowing local users to write to kernel memory. Note: this issue
    does not affect binary kernels provided by Debian. The fix is
    provided for the benefit of users who build their own kernels
    from Debian source.

CVE-2010-1451

    Brad Spengler reported an issue on the SPARC architecture that allows
    local users to execute non-executable pages.

This update also includes fixes a regression introduced by a previous
update. See the referenced Debian bug page for details.

In fact, in worst case, a *double* sized chunk is large enough to hold all necessary data. So, if we have to use the larger chunk than original, we shoudl use min(double of chunk hdr length, asoc->pathmtu, SCTP_DEFAULT_MAXSEGMENT).

So in WINDRIVER patch that ZhuHui released out, there are only one space check for the whole error report sapce: head + data. But with this patch, it may just report the error data without head.

Hi Hui,

As I already mentioned, discussion of the patch should take place in
netdev. You might want to consider CC'ing security@...nel.org too. For a
start, this is not the right list for such a discussion. I don't even
see the maintainer for SCTP cc'ed to the email too. To make it easier
for you, feel free to follow-up from here:
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/159531>.

Thanks, Eugene

3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.

 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <4BD8DC25.4080800@kernel.sg>

Subject: CVE-2010-1173 kernel: skb_over_panic resulting from multiple invalid
 parameter errors

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2010-1173>
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/159531>

Reported by Chris Guo from Nokia China via Red Hat Support. A similar
issue was reported by Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva from Codenomicon Ltd
via CERT-FI. This was also reported by Windriver on behalf of their
customer via vendor-sec.

Kernel crash occurs if sctp listening port receives malformatted init
package.

Its an skb_over_panic BUG halt that results from processing an init
chunk in which too many of its variable length parameters are in some
way malformed.

The problem is in sctp_process_unk_param:
if (NULL == *errp)
  *errp = sctp_make_op_error_space(asoc, chunk,
       ntohs(chunk->chunk_hdr->length));

  if (*errp) {
   sctp_init_cause(*errp, SCTP_ERROR_UNKNOWN_PARAM,
      WORD_ROUND(ntohs(param.p->length)));
   sctp_addto_chunk(*errp,
    WORD_ROUND(ntohs(param.p->length)),
       param.v);

When we allocate an error chunk, we assume that the worst case scenario
requires that we have chunk_hdr->length data allocated, which would be
correct nominally, given that we call sctp_addto_chunk for the violating
parameter. Unfortunately, we also, in sctp_init_cause insert a
sctp_errhdr_t structure into the error chunk, so the worst case
situation in which all parameters are in violation requires
chunk_hdr->length+(sizeof(sctp_errhdr_t)*param_count) bytes of data.

This fix solves the problem by allowing our implementation to only
report a fixed number of errors.  When we encounter an error in
parameter processing we allocate a chunk that is min(asoc->pathmtu,
SCTP_DEFAULT_MAXSEGMENT), limiting our error reporting to a single mtu
sized chunk.  Parameter errors that grow beyond that value are discarded.

Thanks, Eugene

Forward a mail of my workmate:

Make a larger chunk is acceptable but for common communication case, the original one \
is fine enough. And I don't think it is necessary to make such a big chunk. In fact, \
in worst case, a *double* sized chunk is large enough to hold all necessary data. So, \
if we have to use the larger chunk than original, we shoudl use min(double of chunk \
hdr length, asoc->pathmtu, SCTP_DEFAULT_MAXSEGMENT).

For other part of that patch, I think:
-) A logical issue related to function "sctp_init_cause_fixed". Even if it finds the \
space is not enough and return "-ENOSPC", "sctp_addto_chunk_fixed" will still be \
spawned to add error param data in the error report chunk.

-) As I understand, every error report should has two part: head and data. So if the \
chunk doesn't have enough space to hold it, both of them should be discarded. So in \
WINDRIVER patch that ZhuHui released out, there are only one space check for the \
whole error report sapce: head + data. But with this patch, it may just report the \
error data without head.

-) No use to check the "skb_tailroom" serially, for example in call trace \
"sctp_init_cause_fixed -> sctp_addto_chunk_fixed". Here it just use the original \
actp_add_chunk is OK.

-) Make function "sctp_init_cause_fixed", "sctp_addto_chunk_fixed" static inline;

Thanks
Xiao

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=584645#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-04-22 05:39:14 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by Nokia-CN-Flexi via Issue Tracker. A similar issue was reported by Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva from the CROSS open source testing project at Codenomicon Ltd. This was also reported by Windriver on behalf of their customer via vendor-sec.  Kernel crash occurs if sctp listening port receives malformatted init packet.  Its an skb_over_panic BUG halt that results from processing an init chunk in which too many of its variable length parameters are in some way malformed.  The problem is in sctp_process_unk_param: if (NULL == *errp) 	*errp = sctp_make_op_error_space(asoc, chunk, 					 ntohs(chunk->chunk_hdr->length));  	if (*errp) { 		sctp_init_cause(*errp, SCTP_ERROR_UNKNOWN_PARAM, 				 WORD_ROUND(ntohs(param.p->length))); 		sctp_addto_chunk(*errp, 			WORD_ROUND(ntohs(param.p->length)), 				  param.v);  When we allocate an error chunk, we assume that the worst case scenario requires that we have chunk_hdr->length data allocated, which would be correct nominally, given that we call sctp_addto_chunk for the violating parameter.  Unfortunately, we also, in sctp_init_cause insert a sctp_errhdr_t structure into the error chunk, so the worst case situation in which all parameters are in violation requires chunk_hdr->length+(sizeof(sctp_errhdr_t)*param_count) bytes of data.  This fix solves the problem by allowing our implementation to only report a fixed number of errors.  When we encounter an error in parameter processing we allocate a chunk that is min(asoc->pathmtu, SCTP_DEFAULT_MAXSEGMENT), limiting our error reporting to a single mtu sized chunk.  Parameter errors that grow beyond that value are discarded.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=584645#c18)  Neil Horman    2010-04-26 15:30:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 409211](attachment.cgi?id=409211&action=diff "patch to pre-allocate error chunk w/ proper space") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=409211&action=edit "patch to pre-allocate error chunk w/ proper space") patch to pre-allocate error chunk w/ proper space  Heres the patch I've written.
