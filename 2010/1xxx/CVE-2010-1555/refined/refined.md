Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-1555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `getnnmdata.exe` CGI program of HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM).
- It's triggered by an improperly handled `Hostname` parameter passed to this CGI.
- A `sprintf()` call is used to log the error message related to the invalid hostname.
- A critical flaw exists: **no length check** is performed on the `Hostname` parameter before copying it into a fixed-length stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The lack of length validation on the `Hostname` parameter, coupled with the use of `sprintf()` to copy this potentially oversized input into a fixed-size buffer, causes a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- The code execution occurs under the context of the webserver process. This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote network attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network, as the `getnnmdata.exe` CGI is accessible via HTTP requests.
- **Malicious HTTP request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request containing a specially formed `Hostname` parameter to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable HP OpenView NNM.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication. The attacker does not need any valid credentials to execute arbitrary code.
- **Knowledge of target CGI:** The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable CGI script (`getnnmdata.exe`) and the parameter to manipulate (`Hostname`).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to HP by an anonymous researcher working with the TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS users are protected by the Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '9500'.
- HP has released patches to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) versions 7.01, 7.51, and 7.53.

In summary, this is a classic stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve code execution. The vulnerability exists due to a lack of input validation when handling the `Hostname` parameter in the `getnnmdata.exe` CGI.
