Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1352

**Vulnerable Software:** Joomla! Component Juke Box version 1.7

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `com_jukebox` component. The component does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `controller` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include local files, leading to potential information disclosure and other attacks depending on the included files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, source code, or system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
- **Potential for further attacks:** Depending on the included file, the attacker might gain access to more sensitive data, execute code, or escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP request to the vulnerable Joomla! component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Joomla! server. No authentication is mentioned in the exploit details, suggesting it may be exploitable without prior authentication.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable component and parameter (`controller`).

**Technical Details:**

The attacker sends an HTTP request to the Joomla! server with a manipulated `controller` parameter.  The exploit uses directory traversal sequences (`../`) combined with a null byte (`%00`) to bypass input sanitization and access arbitrary files.

**Example Exploit URL:**

```
http://localhost/index.php?option=com_jukebox&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
```
This URL attempts to include the `/etc/passwd` file, which is commonly used to demonstrate LFI vulnerabilities.
