  "CVE-2010-1511": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that KGet would not always wait for user confirmation when downloading metalink files. If a user selected a file to download but did not confirm or cancel the download, KGet would proceed with the download, overwriting any file with the same name. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "KGet does not always wait for user confirmation before downloading metalink files, leading to automatic downloads and potential file overwriting.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure file operation",
      "Missing user confirmation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Unintended file overwriting in user's download directory without user acknowledgment.",
    "Attack vectors": "User tricked into selecting a file to download via a metalink file. Exploitation occurs when the user does not explicitly confirm or cancel the download and the program automatically downloads the file.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide a metalink file which the victim will open."
  }
