Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `modload` module of PostNuke 0.764. This is caused by unsanitized user input in the `sid` parameter within `modules.php`.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
* **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to sensitive data disclosure (e.g., usernames and passwords from the `nuke_users` table), modification of data, or other malicious activities on the database.
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `modules.php` file, using a specially crafted URL with a malicious SQL query injected into the `sid` parameter.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PostNuke installation and needs to manipulate the query string parameters, specifically the `sid` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit provided demonstrates how to retrieve usernames and passwords by injecting the following SQL query into the `sid` parameter:

```
1+and+0+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,concat(pn_uname,0x3a,pn_pass),16,17,18,19,20,21+from+nuke_users--
```

This query uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to append the desired data from the `nuke_users` table to the existing query results. The `concat` function combines the username (`pn_uname`) and password (`pn_pass`) with a colon (0x3a) as a separator.

The vulnerable URL structure is:

```
http://[site]/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=[SQL Injection]
