Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**1. XSS Vulnerability (Internet Explorer Specific)**

*   **Root Cause:** Noncompliant CSS parsing behavior in Internet Explorer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The vulnerability arises because Internet Explorer interprets CSS strings differently than MediaWiki.  Specifically, attackers can craft CSS strings that are considered safe by MediaWiki's sanitization but are then decoded into unsafe strings by Internet Explorer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page which would execute when viewed with IE.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafting malicious CSS strings.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious CSS into the MediaWiki site and the user needs to view the injected content using an affected version of Internet Explorer.

**2. CSRF Vulnerability (Login Interface)**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in account creation and password reset features of the login interface.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** While regular logins were protected against CSRF, the account creation and password reset forms were not.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers can create many accounts via proxying users, bypassing IP blocks (if public account creation is enabled and captcha is not present).
    *   Attackers can create accounts by email and flood innocent parties (if victims are logged in).
    *   Attackers can bypass captcha protection and username blacklists (if the victim is a sysop).
    *   Attackers can bypass blocks and ping limits when sending many password resets, flooding targets.
    *   On private wikis, attackers could create an account by targeting a sysop to gain access to confidential information.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious URL or performing an action that sends a crafted request to the vulnerable MediaWiki site. The attacker needs to know or guess the URL where to send the request.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information indicates that these vulnerabilities are considered serious.
*   Both vulnerabilities are patched in MediaWiki versions 1.15.4 and 1.16.0beta3
*   The bugzilla link (T25371) provides more details related to the CSRF vulnerability.
