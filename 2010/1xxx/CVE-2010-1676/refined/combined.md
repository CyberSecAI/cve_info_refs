# Tor: Remote heap-based buffer overflow — GLSA **201101-02**

Tor is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow that may allow arbitrary
code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/tor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.2.1.28** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.2.1.28** |

### Background

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

### Description

Tor contains a heap-based buffer overflow in the processing of user or
attacker supplied data. No additional information is available.

### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the Tor user, or to cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.2.1.28"
```

Tor 0.2.1.28 does some code cleanup to reduce the risk of remotely
exploitable bugs. Thanks to Willem Pinckaers for notifying us of the
issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned
CVE-2010-1676 to this issue.

We also took this opportunity to change the IP address for one of our
directory authorities, and to update the geoip database we ship.

All Tor users should upgrade.

Changes in version 0.2.1.28 - 2010-12-17
  o Major bugfixes:
    - Fix a remotely exploitable bug that could be used to crash instances
      of Tor remotely by overflowing on the heap. Remote-code execution
      hasn't been confirmed, but can't be ruled out. Everyone should
      upgrade. Bugfix on the 0.1.1 series and later.

  o Directory authority changes:
    - Change IP address and ports for gabelmoo (v3 directory authority).

Package        : tor
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2010-1676

Willem Pinckaers discovered that Tor, a tool to enable online anonymity,
does not correctly handle all data read from the network.  By supplying
specially crafted packets a remote attacker can cause Tor to overflow its
heap, crashing the process. Arbitrary code execution has not been
confirmed but there is a potential risk.

In the stable distribution (lenny), this update also includes an update of
the IP address for the Tor directory authority gabelmoo and addresses
a weakness in the package's postinst maintainer script.

For the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.26-1~lenny+4.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.1.26-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

# Tor 0.2.2.20-alpha is out (security patches)

by phobos | December 20, 2010

![](../static/images/lead.png)

Tor 0.2.2.20-alpha does some code cleanup to reduce the risk of remotely

exploitable bugs. Thanks to Willem Pinckaers for notifying us of the

issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned

CVE-2010-1676 to this issue.

We also fix a variety of other significant bugs, change the IP address

for one of our directory authorities, and update the minimum version

that Tor relays must run to join the network.

All Tor users should upgrade.

<https://www.torproject.org/download/download>

Changes in version 0.2.2.20-alpha - 2010-12-17

**Major bugfixes:**

* Fix a remotely exploitable bug that could be used to crash instances

  of Tor remotely by overflowing on the heap. Remote-code execution

  hasn't been confirmed, but can't be ruled out. Everyone should

  upgrade. Bugfix on the 0.1.1 series and later.
* Fix a bug that could break accounting on 64-bit systems with large

  time\_t values, making them hibernate for impossibly long intervals.

  Fixes bug 2146. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre6; fix by boboper.
* Fix a logic error in directory\_fetches\_from\_authorities() that

  would cause all \_non\_-exits refusing single-hop-like circuits

  to fetch from authorities, when we wanted to have \_exits\_ fetch

  from authorities. Fixes more of 2097. Bugfix on 0.2.2.16-alpha;

  fix by boboper.
* Fix a stream fairness bug that would cause newer streams on a given

  circuit to get preference when reading bytes from the origin or

  destination. Fixes bug 2210. Fix by Mashael AlSabah. This bug was

  introduced before the first Tor release, in svn revision r152.

**Directory authority changes:**

* Change IP address and ports for gabelmoo (v3 directory authority).

**Minor bugfixes:**

* Avoid crashes when AccountingMax is set on clients. Fixes bug 2235.

  Bugfix on 0.2.2.18-alpha. Diagnosed by boboper.
* Fix an off-by-one error in calculating some controller command

  argument lengths. Fortunately, this mistake is harmless since

  the controller code does redundant NUL termination too. Found by

  boboper. Bugfix on 0.1.1.1-alpha.
* Do not dereference NULL if a bridge fails to build its

  extra-info descriptor. Found by an anonymous commenter on

  Trac. Bugfix on 0.2.2.19-alpha.

**Minor features:**

* Update to the December 1 2010 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.
* Directory authorities now reject relays running any versions of

  Tor between 0.2.1.3-alpha and 0.2.1.18 inclusive; they have

  known bugs that keep RELAY\_EARLY cells from working on rendezvous

  circuits. Followup to fix for bug 2081.
* Directory authorities now reject relays running any version of Tor

  older than 0.2.0.26-rc. That version is the earliest that fetches

  current directory information correctly. Fixes bug 2156.
* Report only the top 10 ports in exit-port stats in order not to

  exceed the maximum extra-info descriptor length of 50 KB. Implements

  task 2196.

* [Projects we are working on in 2025](/tpo/team/-/wikis/projects-2025)
* [List of projects](/tpo/team/-/wikis/projects) that we completed.
* Internships we are usually running almost every year:
  + [Outreachy](/tpo/team/-/wikis/outreachy) provides internships in open source to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by under-representation in the technical industry where they are living.
  + [Google Summer of Code](/tpo/team/-/wikis/gsoc) is the internship that we participate to mentor students coming into the open source world.

# Organization

The Tor Project is not a horizontal organization but we try to make decisions as democratic as possible. We have a [structure](/tpo/team/-/wikis/work-relationships) where we operate and maintain the different pieces of software in teams. Our teams meet once a week to coordinate work and also meet frequently to coordinate projects. We have a [project manager](/tpo/team/-/wikis/Process/HowProjectManagementAtTheTorProject) that facilitates the coordination and keeps an eye on the roadmaps to get to deadlines on time.

In 2018, the Executive Director at the Tor Project and set the following goals for the next 3 to 5 years, for the organization and its projects:

**A Mature Tor Project (organization)**

* Stable income flows from a diverse funding base
* Diverse and robust organization that meets our needs
* Strong organizational culture focuses on employees and volunteers happiness
* Global brand recognition - Tor means strong privacy

**Full Access (product/projects)**

* Any person on the planet can access the Tor network
* Any person on the planet can use the Tor network to access any websites or services online
* Ensure the Tor network is diverse, healthy, stable, and scalable

~~As of August 2021, we started to implement ~~[~~OKRs~~](/tpo/team/-/wikis/okrs/home)~~ to set goals per team and role and track outcomes and organize the work ahead. Each team lead has setup OKRs with help of their team (you can find them in each team's wiki) as well as Roger for the ~~[~~areas he is working on~~](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/arma)~~.~~

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
