Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2010-1930:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Off-by-one error in the handling of the 'Tree' parameter during the login process of Novell iManager.
*   **Weakness:** The web server does not properly validate the length of the `Tree` parameter in the login request. Specifically, if the length is exactly 256 characters, it causes a crash. This is because the code is likely allocating 256 bytes of memory and copying 256 bytes into it without null termination, which leads to a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to crash the iManager web server, rendering the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted login request with the 'Tree' parameter containing exactly 256 characters. The request is sent via HTTP POST to the `/nps/servlet/webacc/` URI.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and can launch the attack remotely. No prior access is required.

**Technical Details (From Exploit-DB):**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a login request with a 'TREE' field of exactly 256 characters is sent.
*   The provided Python proof-of-concept (PoC) script demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability to crash the Novell iManager server by sending this crafted request.
*   The script also checks if the server uses SSL/TLS (HTTPS) or plain HTTP, and attempts to reconnect after the attack to verify that it has crashed the server.
*   The vulnerable code handles the 'Tree' parameter without properly checking for the length equal to 256 characters. This causes a buffer overflow.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Novell iManager 2.7
*   Novell iManager 2.7.3
*   Novell iManager 2.7.3 FTF2
*   Older versions are likely affected but not confirmed.

**Fixed Versions:**

*   Novell iManager 2.7.3 ftf4
*    Novell iManager 2.7.4

**Mitigation:**

*   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to limit the length of the `Tree` parameter in POST requests to the URI `/nps/servlet/webacc/`. Similar rules can also be implemented in the Apache webserver.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry also discusses CVE-2010-1929, which is a separate stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that requires authentication. However, this analysis is focused on CVE-2010-1930.
*   The advisory also details the communication timeline between the researchers and Novell, including delays and a temporary retraction of the advisory.
