Subject: kernel: btrfs: check for read permission on src file in the clone
 ioctl

The existing [btrfs] code would have allowed you to clone a file that
was only open for writing. Not an expected behaviour.

Upstream commit:
<http://git.kernel.org/linus/5dc6416414fb3ec6e2825fd4d20c8bf1d7fe0395>

Reference:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=593226>

I'm not requesting a CVE name for this as it did not affect any of Red
Hats' supported Linux kernels.

Thanks, Eugene

### Bug Description

I have discovered two security issues in btrfs, tested on kernel 2.6.32-22-generic on Lucid. I've confirmed that these issues affect all versions >= 2.6.29. I've reported these issues to <email address hidden>, but am posting it here so there's a record that it affects Ubuntu.

1. The btrfs\_ioctl\_clone() ioctl, which copies the provided source file descriptor to a destination file descriptor, fails to check that the source file descriptor has been opened for reading before copying. This can allow an attacker to copy (and subsequently read) files without read permission. I've attached a simple reproducer (exploit.c) to verify the issue, which can be tested as follows:

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=fs.iso bs=1M count=500

$ losetup /dev/loop7 fs.iso

$ mkfs.btrfs /dev/loop7

$ mkdir mountpoint

$ mount /dev/loop7 mountpoint

$ cd mountpoint

$ echo "This is a write-only file" > target

$ chmod 200 target

$ ./exploit target output

$ cat output

This is a write-only file

2. btrfs\_ioctl\_trans\_start() requires CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN to start a transaction, but btrfs\_ioctl\_trans\_end() does not, allowing unprivileged users to end other users' transactions. While the security implications of this are a bit unclear, it seems unwise especially given the warnings about how transactions should only be started and ended by privileged processes, given the chance of deadlock.

I've attached a patch that requires CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN to end transactions and checks read permissions on the source file for the clone ioctl (btrfs.patch).

Subject: Re: kernel: btrfs: check for read permission on src
	file in the clone ioctl

Ubuntu 10.4 ships with a kernel that supports btrfs:

[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/579585](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/579585)

In case the bug description needs clarification, the bug allows an
unprivileged user to clone files that can be opened for writing
without read permissions.  Since cloning results in the creation of a
duplicate copy owned by the user who performed the cloning operation,
this is an information disclosure vulnerability.
