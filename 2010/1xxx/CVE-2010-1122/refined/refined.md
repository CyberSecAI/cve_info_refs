Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the WOFF (Web Open Font Format) parser within Mozilla's Core Layout engine. Specifically, the code calculated the total size of tables within a WOFF font file. It used 32-bit integers for calculations. When the cumulative size of the tables exceeded the maximum value a 32-bit integer could hold, an integer overflow occurred, leading to an incorrect total size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the use of 32-bit integers to track the total size of tables in a WOFF file. This allows a maliciously crafted WOFF file to cause an overflow.
*   **Heap Corruption:** The integer overflow results in an undersized buffer being allocated to decompress the font data. This causes the decompressed font data to overwrite other areas of memory on the heap, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The memory corruption can lead to a crash of the application using the vulnerable WOFF parser.
*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** The heap corruption could be further exploited to potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WOFF file:** An attacker can craft a malicious WOFF file that exploits the integer overflow.
*   **Web page:** The crafted WOFF file can be included in a malicious web page which the victim user visits through a web browser like Firefox.
*   **Other applications:** This could be exploited by any application that uses the vulnerable WOFF parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting a malicious WOFF file:** The attacker must be able to create a WOFF file that triggers the integer overflow.
*   **Delivery of the malicious file:** The attacker must find a way to deliver the malicious WOFF file to the victim user via a malicious web page or other means.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was present in Firefox 3.6.2 and later, and was fixed in the 1.9.2 branch of Mozilla's code, specifically affecting the layout engine component of the Core product.
*   The fix involved switching to 64-bit arithmetic to avoid the overflow and sanity checks to ensure that font files does not exceed reasonable limits.

This bug report also references CVE-2010-1028 and indicates that CVE-2010-1122 is related to issues discovered in [comment 7](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=552216#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - WOFF heap corruption due to integer overflow"). CVE-2010-1122 is related to crashes that were occurring in versions of firefox 3.5.x due to similar memory corruption issues, but not directly involving the woff parser. The bug report clarifies that 3.5.x versions of firefox are not affected by the WOFF integer overflow as the woff parser was introduced in later versions.
