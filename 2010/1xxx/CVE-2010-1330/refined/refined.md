  "CVE-2010-1330": {
    "description": "The JRuby 1.4.1 release fixes an XSS vulnerability in JRuby 1.4.0. Previous versions contained a bug in JRubyâ€™s regular expression engine that could allow an attacker to perform, for example, an XSS attack on a web application running under JRuby.",
    "vulnerability": "A bug in JRuby's regular expression engine.",
    "affected_code": "Any Ruby application code that uses regular expressions for string matching and substitution running under JRuby and using `$KCODE = 'u'` is vulnerable. If a string contains invalid UTF-8 byte sequences in the (inclusive) range `\\xC0` to `\\xFD`, the immediately following character will not be matched by a regular expression.",
    "impact": "An attacker can perform an XSS attack on a web application running under JRuby. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web script via specially-crafted input provided to an JRuby application.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing specially crafted input to a JRuby application that uses regular expressions with `$KCODE = 'u'` to match or substitute strings containing invalid UTF-8 byte sequences.",
    "fixes": "The JRuby 1.4.1 and 1.5.0 releases (including release candidates) all have the vulnerability fixed. The fix was applied to the jcodings library which JRuby uses. As such, a source patch against the JRuby source is not available. Replacing the `build_lib/jcodings.jar` file in your JRuby source build with the jcodings version 1.0.3 jar file is sufficient to resolve the issue."
