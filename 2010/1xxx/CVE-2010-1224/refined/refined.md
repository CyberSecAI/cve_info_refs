{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an invalid parsing of ACL rules when using CIDR notation '/0' in the 'permit=' and 'deny=' configurations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Incorrect calculation of network mask"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could allow unauthorized access from hosts that should be denied. While authentication measures are still in place, initial access control can be bypassed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote access from unauthenticated sessions"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to make a connection to the Asterisk system from a source IP address that would be incorrectly allowed due to the vulnerable ACL rule parsing logic."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Asterisk Open Source 1.6.x (1.6.0, 1.6.1, and 1.6.2 releases)"
  ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "Asterisk 1.6.0.25",
    "Asterisk 1.6.1.17",
    "Asterisk 1.6.2.5"
  ],
  "patch_details": "The code has been corrected to consistently handle the '/0' CIDR notation. The fix specifically handles the case where x==0 to prevent unpredictable shifting left 32 bits. This ensures consistent behavior and proper access denial from hosts that should be blocked."
