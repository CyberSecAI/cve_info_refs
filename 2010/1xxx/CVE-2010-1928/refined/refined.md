```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to both Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within file include statements.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, leading to potential information disclosure or arbitrary code execution by including malicious PHP code. Similarly, remote files containing malicious PHP code can be included, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests with manipulated 'path_om' parameter in various PHP files (RFI)",
    "HTTP GET request with manipulated 'dsn[phptype]' parameter in 'soustab.php' (LFI)"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication or prior access is mentioned."
