Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in PrettyFormMail. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS (CWE-79). The application is vulnerable to injecting arbitrary scripts via user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary scripts that will be executed in the victim's web browser when they interact with the application. This can lead to:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the victim's session cookies.
  - **Defacement:** Displaying malicious content or altering the appearance of the website.
  - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the victim to a site that attempts to install malware.
  - **Phishing:** Presenting fake login forms to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the user-supplied input fields in the HTML forms processed by PrettyFormMail.
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into these input fields.
- When the server renders the output, the injected script is executed in the browser of anyone accessing that page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit input to the PrettyFormMail application.
- They do not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attack can be launched remotely over the internet.
