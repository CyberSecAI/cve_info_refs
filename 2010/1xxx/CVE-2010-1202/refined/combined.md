# USN-930-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

29 June 2010

Firefox could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file or website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.2) - XUL + XPCOM application runner

## Details

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.0)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.0/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)
  -
  [1.9.2.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2/1.9.2.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [abrowser](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)
  -
  [1.9.2.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2/1.9.2.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

Mozilla has changed the support model for Firefox and they no longer

support version 3.0 of the browser. As a result, Ubuntu is providing an

upgrade to Firefox 3.6 for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS users, which is the most current

stable release of Firefox supported by Mozilla. When upgrading, users

should be aware of the following:

* Firefox 3.6 does not support version 5 of the Sun Java plugin. Please use

  icedtea-java7-plugin or sun-java6-plugin instead.
* After upgrading to Firefox 3.6.6, users may be prompted to upgrade 3rd

  party Add-Ons. In some cases, an Add-On will not be compatible with

  Firefox 3.6.6 and have no update available. In these cases, Firefox will

  notify the user that it is disabling the Add-On.
* Upgrades to Ubuntu 8.10 from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS may break the browser.

  Ubuntu 8.10 is no longer officially supported and users are required to

  upgrade to 9.04 to receive active security support and a functional browser.
* Font configuration cannot be controlled via Gnome settings. This is a

  known issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/559149> and will

  be fixed in a later update.
* helix-player is not currently supported in Firefox 3.6. This is a known

  issue and may be fixed in a future update.
* RealAudio via the totem plugin is no longer supported in Firefox 3.6 in

  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Affected users navigating to Real content will be

  prompted to install optional community supported packages.
* In Ubuntu 8.04 LTS the xine plugin is non-functional. After upgrading to

  Firefox 3.6, the plugin may cause the browser to crash, while in Firefox

  3.0 it would be silently ignored. Users are advised to uninstall

  xine-plugin and/or gxineplugin.
* Plugins using external helpers (such as Totem) may not close when using

  the Epiphany browser. This is a known issue being tracked in

  <https://launchpad.net/bugs/599796> and will be fixed in a later update.

  This issue only affects Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.5.10, fixing various bugs
and security issues.
MFSA 2010-33 / CVE-2008-5913:
Security researcher Amit Klein reported that it was possible to reverse
engineer the value used to seed Math.random(). Since the pseudo-random
number generator was only seeded once per browsing session, this seed
value could be used as a unique token to identify and track users
across different web sites.
MFSA 2010-32 / CVE-2010-1197:
Security researcher Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive reported that
the Content-Disposition: attachment HTTP header was ignored when
Content-Type: multipart was also present. This issue could potentially
lead to XSS problems in sites that allow users to upload arbitrary
files and specify a Content-Type but rely on Content-Disposition:
attachment to prevent the content from being displayed inline.
MFSA 2010-31 / CVE-2010-1125:
Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that focus()
could be used to change a user's cursor focus while they are
typing, potentially directing their keyboard input to an unintended
location. This behavior was also present across origins when content
from one domain was embedded within another via an IFRAME. A malicious
web page could use this behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim
while they were typing sensitive information such as a password.
MFSA 2010-30 / CVE-2010-1199:
Security researcher Martin Barbella reported via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative that an XSLT node sorting routine contained an integer
overflow vulnerability. In cases where one of the nodes to be sorted
contained a very large text value, the integer used to allocate a
memory buffer to store its value would overflow, resulting in too small
a buffer being created. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
write data past the end of the buffer, causing the browser to crash
and potentially running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-29 / CVE-2010-1196:
Security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity reported that the routine
for setting the text value for certain types of DOM nodes contained an
integer overflow vulnerability. When a very long string was passed to
this routine, the integer value used in creating a new memory buffer
to hold the string would overflow, resulting in too small a buffer
being allocated. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write
data past the end of the buffer, causing a crash and potentially
running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-28 / CVE-2010-1198:
Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that two plugin instances
could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a reference to an
object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold that reference
after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is destroyed. In
these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer to freed memory
which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-27 / CVE-2010-0183:
Security researcher wushi of team509 reported that the frame
construction process for certain types of menus could result in a menu
containing a pointer to a previously freed menu item. During the cycle
collection process, this freed item could be accessed, resulting in the
execution of a section of code potentially controlled by an attacker.
MFSA 2010-26 / CVE-2010-1200 / CVE-2010-1201 / CVE-2010-1202 / CVE-2010-1203:
Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2010-25 / CVE-2010-1121:
A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity during the 2010 Pwn2Own
contest sponsored by TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. By moving
DOM nodes between documents Nils found a case where the moved node
incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could
be triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this
freed object. The contest winning exploit only affects Firefox 3.6
and not earlier versions. Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5,
SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the
browser engine were patched just in case there is an alternate way
of triggering the underlying flaw.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

[1821-line reduced testcase](attachment.cgi?id=440713)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=440713&action=edit)

The 1821-line (of which only the last line seems interesting) testcase asserts js debug shell on TM tip without -j at Assertion failure: cx->throwing, at ../jsops.cpp:3581 and crashes js opt shell on TM tip without -j at js\_Interpret
During the course of the reduction (many thanks go out to Jesse for his great help!), the asserts varied in message and so did the crash signature location.
I tested on Linux 64-bit, while Jesse was able to reproduce on Mac 32-bit.
s-s because crashing all over the place is scary. Assuming [sg:critical?] unless otherwise.
autoBisect coming up.

I'm unable to bisect this because it goes way back - not as old as the 01 Jan 2006 js shell but it seems to already occur in Jan 2009:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/tracemonkey/rev/1dd1af3aec3e>
Prior to that I'm unable to compile on my 10.6.x machine.

The generated code here has the wrong jump offset:
00000: 1 trace
main:
00001: 1 try
00002: 1 goto 7 (5) <---- wrong
00005: 1 enterblock depth 0 {e: 0}
00008: 1 exception
00009: 1 setlocalpop 0
00012: 1 leaveblock 1
00015: 1 goto 19 (4) <---- right
00018: 1 nop
00019: 2 try
Both should jump to offset 19. The backpatching code works correctly at first. Here is the stack where the correct offset is overwritten:

This is like saying "could we always emit 32-bit jump offsets?" Maybe but is it going to waste too much space or ding one of our time-perf metrics? That is more work to answer.
How about we fix this old bug directly, instead of asking questions that do not actually do a thing to fix this old bug?

"always costs time" is false -- it should not even be called except for large scripts (ones that have <-32K/>=32K jump offsets or >=32K deltas between jumps to backpatch.
dvander, are you seeing it called for small scripts? Stack or it didn't happen :-P

Of course, it can happen with a jump far down in a big straight line script, since the first backpatch-delta is from top of script. That's what is happening here.

Actually from (top of script AKA 0 offset) - 1, hence the goto being emitted at 32767 having a bpdelta of 32768.

OK, the actual stack where the offset is overwritten with bad stuff is shown below. BuildSpanDepTable is not the culprit. When we return from BuildSpanDepTable, the JSJumpTarget for that instruction is correct (the offset is 18). Below it is changed to 5 while we are emitting bytecode for an unrelated statement.

That in turn is happening because js\_SetJumpOffset calls GetSpanDep(cg, pc) to get the JSSpanDep to update; but:
(gdb) p pc - cg->main.base
$1 = 32773
(gdb) n
1235 return SetSpanDepTarget(cx, cg, GetSpanDep(cg, pc), off);
(gdb) s
GetSpanDep (cg=0xbfffee18, pc=0x8305379 "\256") at ../jsemit.cpp:674
674 index = GET\_SPANDEP\_INDEX(pc);
(gdb) n
675 if (index != SPANDEP\_INDEX\_HUGE)
(gdb) p index
$2 = 0
(gdb) x/3bx pc
0x8305379: 0xae 0x00 0x00
(gdb) p (JSOp) 0xae
$3 = JSOP\_FILTER
This instruction hasn't been assigned a JSSpanDep yet. So GetSpanDep will carelessly return cg->spanDeps[0], the record for the very first jump in the script.

Thanks -- whew! This goes back to the dawn of E4X.
$ egrep 'JSOP\_(OR|AND|GOSUB|CASE|DEFAULT|IF)' jsemit.cpp|grep Emit3
comes up empty for me, and JSOP\_ENDFILTER is emitted via EmitJump. It looks like JSOP\_FILTER is the only jump emitted incorrectly (not via EmitJump), pre-patch.

Attached patch

[fix v3](attachment.cgi?id=414777&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=414777&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=424558&attachment=414777)

The fix changes SprintCString to insist that the function is never called with a string pointing into the buffer that could be reallocated. This required to fix a few its callers to use offsets rather then char\* strings and rely on a special SprintOffset when printing.
Strictly speaking the fix from the [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=424558#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use after free in decompiler") would also work as it turned (at least AFAICS) there is no code that does something like:
lval = POP\_STR();
rval = POP\_STR();
SprintCString(lval)
SprintCString(rval)
That type of code would defeat the minimal fix as the code could reallocate twice defeating the checks there.
With a bigger fix from this patch that would be detected immediately via an assert in SprintCString.
Gary, could you fuzz this?

Regarding severity of this bug. As a consequences of this bug code can read (and only read!) memory that is freed when realloc moves the allocated memory to a bigger allocation size. In an embedding with many threads that could be used in principle to read the memory allocated by other threads.

"We use that P implies Q" should be reworded, either to "Note that P implies Q" or "We use the fact that P implies Q" -- the former is shorter.

Patch seems fine, wondering if there isn't a less invasive one that copes with realloc moving the buffer that SprintCString is both reading from and writing to. That would minimize the change and be no less safe AFAICT.

The minimal version is in the attachment from the [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=424558#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use after free in decompiler"). It works since as far as I can see after checking the code few times there is no sequences like
lval = POP\_STR();
rval = POP\_STR();
SprintCString(lval)
SprintCString(rval)
Such sequences may realloc the buffer twice defeating the checks proposed in the minimal fix.
Now, the minimal fix does not guarantee that future modifications of the code would not introduce the above sequences resurrecting the bug. To protect against that via an assert coverage on the hot path in the decompiler I do not see how it is possible to be less invasive than the patch from the [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=424558#c11 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use after free in decompiler").

That's right, by design the only safe pattern is pop\*;push where \* is Kleene closure and pop is POP\_STR and variants, push is todo = Sprint\* | PushOff(todo).
This is an old design and it's unchecked, so unreliable. On the other hand, we have not had many bugs in it because it fits the pattern of the decompiler's abstract interpreter. I'm therefore inclined toward a minimal patch with asserts.

Hmm, it is hard to check. An assertion that no two SprintCString calls, both taking arguments on the sprint stack, occur without an intervening PopOff, might be enough.
I'll review the bigger patch in detail.

>+#define POP\_OFF() PopOff(ss, op)
No problem having a macro for symmetry but please #undef in the right order at the bottom of the function.
Another way to go would be a C++ auto-storage class helper or two, e.g., a StringOffset type, to sugar the OFF2STR a bit. But this can wait for another bug, if it is worth doing at all.
r=me with that, thanks.

What was the bug with the bigger patch? Switching to offsets instead of strings shouldn't have regressed anything if that's all that changed.

> What was the bug with the bigger patch?
A single typo of using += instead of = in GetLocal has caused the regressin in the [bug 531746](/show_bug.cgi?id=531746 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ strlen]"). But there is a bigger problem with the patch. Right now GetLocal callers ignore OOM failures. That is no good since in couple of places that is feed right into SprintCString leading to straigh NULL deref (I will file a bug about it). But the patch made things worse since with it GetLocal returns -1 and now those unchecked callers will access Sprint->buf[-1].

perhaps i shouldn't have, i did intentionally select to include it. for trunk, i had recently pushed a change of igor's which had sat waiting for 11 days. personally for my changes i appreciate it when others push for me.
there was no indication in the bug of any reason not to push it, and had the necessary stamps.

It is my fault. I forgot to land the small patch from the [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=424558#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use after free in decompiler") and forgot to cite the changeset for bigger patch backout. So the big patch should be taken out and the small should be landed instead with nit fixed.

Is this waiting on a tm->m-c merge? Or could the patch go into the release repo/branch(s/es, I'm not remembering the details) too?

In the future, please correctly attribute patches to their actual authors. You can do this using the "-u" option to `hg commit`. Example: `hg commit -u "John Doe <jdoe@example.com>"`. The days of CVS are long past; Hg gives us far more abilities and features, so let's use them.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Jesse, this is a bug we really should have found using fuzzing and gczeal. Want to dig into this a bit and find out why we didn't? This is xpcshell, but this can probably be triggered from the regular shell or the browser as well.

drivers, this bug is very high risk and the patch is very low risk (no side effects, just ensure a root survives a potential GC). I recommend you take it for the next 1.9.2 dot release even if its late in the cycle.

Not really. In theory, we should be able to make it crash, but the only reproducible test case we have was triggered by a patch Andreas is working on for TM trunk.

I wasn't able to synthesize a test case for this that actually crashes, but I can try a little harder maybe with a bit fuzzer help. The basic ingredients are JSON.stringify and passing gc() as the replacer function (in the browser substitute gc with a function that allocates a ton of garbage). I will talk to Jesse to see if we can increase the frequencies of those atoms in the fuzzer output and force a test case.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

firefox security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2010-0500)

Original Release Date: June 25, 2010

Last Revised: July 7, 2011

Number: ASA-2010-165

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1121](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1121.html), [CVE-2010-1200](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1200.html), [CVE-2010-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1202.html) and [CVE-2010-1203](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1203.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for
a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1198](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1198.html) to this issue.

Several integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed
web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1196](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1196.html) and [CVE-2010-1199](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1199.html) to these issues.

A focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A
malicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,
such as usernames and passwords. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1125](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1125.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the "Content-Disposition:
attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
also present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the
"Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent content from being
displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content
to users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1197](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1197.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could
be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different
websites. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-5913](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2008-5913.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.
Certain security checks were not being called when an XML document was
loaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load
certain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its
add-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML
document. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-0182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0182.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0500.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using RHEL4 with the affected version of firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 2.0 including 2.0 SP1 and 2.0 SP2 | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 5.2.2 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=526449#c0)• 15 years ago |
|  | |

The following example crashes in multi-threaded shell in FinishSharingTitle:
function test() {
function makeWorkerFn(id, bar) {
return function() {
bar[id] = 0;
};
}
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
var bar = [];
bar.x = 0;
var a = [];
for (var j = 0; j != 100; ++j)
a.push(makeWorkerFn(j, bar));
scatter(a);
}
}
test();
The reason for the crash is that for the slow array FinishSharingTitle mistreats JSSLOT\_ARRAY\_LENGTH slot as a slot containing GC things and crashes when reinterpreting the array length, 100, as JSString.
I am not sure about severity of this bug. It cannot be triggered via the browser since even thread workers does not allow to share anything between threads. On other hand there are extensions that use threads with shared objects. For them the bug is relevant so I mark it as restricted.

Attached patch

[v1](attachment.cgi?id=415948&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=415948&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=526449&attachment=415948)

The patch marks the slow array class with the JSCLASS\_HAS\_PRIVATE class taking advantage of the changes from the [bug 513190](/show_bug.cgi?id=513190 "RESOLVED FIXED - avoiding jsint tagging of the private slot data") to fix this bug and eliminate slow\_array\_trace hack.
I will ask for a review later after some testing.

The new version is v1 + jsscript.cpp cleanup. The latter comes from a big initial patch involving JSCLASS\_START refactoring. I had been writing until I realized that marking the slow array class with JSCLASS\_HAS\_PRIVATE is enough to fix this.

Do you mean you got the assert just by running the shell?

The assert on 1.9.2 is a regression from the [bug 534051](/show_bug.cgi?id=534051 "RESOLVED FIXED - Workers: Don't change the global object while GC is running") that have not yet landed on branches, see [bug 534308](/show_bug.cgi?id=534308 "RESOLVED FIXED - Request needed for jsshell").

The fix for 191 needs another patch. On that branch the private slot is treated as jsval so to fix this we just need to skip the slots in FinishSharingTitle with an explicit class check.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-26

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.2.4/ 1.9.1.10)

Announced
June 22, 2010
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.10
* Firefox 3.6.4
* SeaMonkey 2.0.5
* Thunderbird 3.0.5

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in
the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Details

USN-930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox and Xulrunner. This update

provides updated packages for use with Firefox 3.6 and Xulrunner 1.9.2 on

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))
