Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2010-1776:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that disabling the "Find My iPhone" service in MobileMe settings only prevents the device from being located via MobileMe but does not prevent the phone from being remotely wiped.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control: Disabling "Find My iPhone" did not disable the remote wipe feature.
- Logic error: There was a logical disconnect between the "Find My iPhone" service and the remote wipe functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the MobileMe account password could remotely wipe the device, even if "Find My iPhone" is disabled.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The attacker needs to know the MobileMe account credentials associated with the targeted device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid MobileMe account credentials associated with the targeted device.
