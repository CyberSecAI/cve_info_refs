{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to improper handling of the LANG_CODE parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the LANG_CODE parameter in the URL of the `common.inc.php` file, an attacker can include local files using directory traversal.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the `LANG_CODE` parameter. No special privileges are required."
