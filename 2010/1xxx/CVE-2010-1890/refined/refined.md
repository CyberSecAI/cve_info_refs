### Summary of CVE-2010-1890

**Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel's improper validation of access control lists (ACLs) on kernel objects.

**Vulnerability:**  A denial-of-service vulnerability is present due to the kernel's failure to correctly validate ACLs on kernel objects.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service. The system becomes unresponsive and automatically restarts. This vulnerability does not allow for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation, only a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system.  They can then run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid local account and the ability to execute code on the target machine. This cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
