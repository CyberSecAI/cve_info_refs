Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1278:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `www.zerodayinitiative.com` explicitly mentions `CVE-2010-1278` and its association with the `Adobe Download Manager`.
*   The description provided aligns with the typical characteristics of a buffer overflow vulnerability, which is consistent with known attack patterns against ActiveX controls.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `gp.ocx` ActiveX control of the Adobe Download Manager.
*   Specifically, the `Atlcom.get_atlcom` ProgID control copies values from two parameters into a fixed-length buffer, without sufficient validation, allowing an attacker to cause a buffer overflow by supplying excessively long input parameters.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow due to improper handling of input parameters by the ActiveX control.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   The code executes with the privileges of the user who is running the web browser, potentially enabling the attacker to gain full control of the system if the user has administrator rights.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered through a malicious web page.
*   The user must visit a web page containing the malicious ActiveX control to initiate the exploit.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located remotely, without needing physical access to the target machine.
*   **Web Server or Compromised Site:** The attacker needs to host the malicious web page containing the specially crafted exploit.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker likely needs to entice the target to visit the malicious page, which usually entails some social engineering.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** The affected ActiveX control's CLSID is {E2883E8F-472F-4fb0-9522-AC9BF37916A7} and its ProgID is `Atlcom.get_atlcom`.
*   **Vendor Response:** Adobe has released a security update to address this vulnerability (APSB10-02).
*   **Trend Micro TippingPoint Protection:** Trend Micro's TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 9479
