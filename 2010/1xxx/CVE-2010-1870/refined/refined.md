Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the Apache Struts 2 framework's XWork component. Specifically, the `ParametersInterceptor`, which is enabled by default, treats HTTP parameter names as OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions. This allows an attacker to manipulate server-side context objects by injecting malicious OGNL expressions via crafted HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OGNL Expression Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary OGNL expressions through HTTP parameter names.
*   **Bypassing Security Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the intended security restrictions that were meant to prevent access to sensitive context variables. The initial protection against "#" in parameter names was bypassed using Java's unicode string representation of the # character: `\u0023`.
*   **Access to Context Variables:** Attackers can access and manipulate OGNL context variables such as `#context`, `#_memberAccess`, `#root`, `#this` etc, which represent server-side objects.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `ParametersInterceptor` does not adequately sanitize user-supplied input, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted server. This includes:
* **Remote Command Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the application server process.
*   **Server Context Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate server-side objects and potentially gain full control of the application.
*   **Data Breaches:**  Compromised servers can be used to steal sensitive data or use the server as a base for further attacks.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In the case of Cisco Unified CCE, the vulnerability allows remote code execution with *Administrator* privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The primary attack vector is sending crafted HTTP requests containing malicious OGNL expressions within the parameter names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Knowledge of OGNL:** The attacker needs to be familiar with OGNL to craft the malicious expressions.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products, including Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series, Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), Cisco Media Experience Engine (MXE) 3500 Series, and Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Cisco Unified CCE).
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input by the affected software, allowing an attacker to bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary commands.
*   Exploitation on Cisco Unified CCE allows remote code execution with *Administrator* privileges.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) for this exploit was publicly available.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The fix involves upgrading to Struts 2.2.1 or applying a parameter exclusion configuration in `struts.xml` as a workaround.

* The vulnerability was discovered by Meder Kydyraliev of the Google Security Team

**Summary of Fixes**
*   Upgrade to Struts 2.2.1, which implements a strict whitelist for parameter names.
*   Apply a parameter exclusion configuration in `struts.xml` to blacklist malicious characters or whitelist allowed characters, as a workaround when upgrading isn't possible. The recommended regex to exclude malicious parameters is: `<param name="excludeParams">dojo\..*,^struts\..*,.*\\.*,.*\(.*,.*\).*,.*@.*</param>`. It's important to apply this to all `params` interceptors in the application.
