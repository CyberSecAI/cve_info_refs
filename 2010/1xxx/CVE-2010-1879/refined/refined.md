      "vulnerability": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Windows handles media files. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opened a specially crafted media file. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",

        "Improper handling of specially crafted compression data in media files processing."

      "impact": "Remote code execution, complete control of the affected system, arbitrary code execution, install programs, view/change/delete data, create new accounts with full user rights.",

       "vulnerability": "For Direct Show, the vulnerability requires a user to open a specially crafted MJPEG video file. For the Windows Media Format Runtime-based application, the vulnerability requires a user to open a specially crafted ASF file (having JPEG embedded) in any Windows Media Format Runtime-based application for any malicious action to occur. For the Windows Media Encoder, the vulnerability requires a user to open a specially crafted JPEG file for encoding or open an already-created project file (.wma) with a specially crafted JPEG file embedded in it. For the Asycfilt.dll (COM component), the vulnerability requires a user to open a specially crafted media file."
