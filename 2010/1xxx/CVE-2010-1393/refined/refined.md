{
  "CVE-2010-1393": {
    "Description": "An information disclosure issue exists in WebKit's handling of Cascading Stylesheets. If a stylesheet's HREF attribute is set to a URL that causes a redirection, scripts on the page may be able to access the redirected URL. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to the disclosure of sensitive URLs on another site. This issue is addressed by returning the original URL to scripts, rather than the redirected URL.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how WebKit handles redirects when loading stylesheets. When a stylesheet's HREF attribute is set to a URL that results in a redirection, scripts on the page can access the redirected URL instead of the original one.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure vulnerability due to improper handling of redirects for stylesheets.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive URLs from another site by crafting a malicious website that uses a stylesheet with a redirect.",
    "Attack vectors": "Visiting a maliciously crafted website.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a website with a stylesheet that has a redirection and then trick the victim into visiting the page."
