        "Data": {
          "Root cause": "The specific flaw exists within the way Webkit implements the 'first-letter' css style. If a container with the first-color style has it's contents replaced with a particular element, the library will create a dual reference of the style in order to apply to its contents. Later when the element is freed, the dangling reference will still be applied to the style.",

          "Impact": "Upon navigating the document's styles for either repainting or style recalculation, the application will access the freed memory which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
