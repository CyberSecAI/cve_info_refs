Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1046:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` file of Rostermain version 1.1 and earlier.
*   The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_POST['userid']` and `$_POST['password']`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code constructs a SQL query by directly embedding the username and password from POST parameters, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by injecting SQL code into the username and password fields.
*   **Data Exposure:** While not explicitly mentioned, successful SQL injection could also lead to unauthorized access to and modification of database contents.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP POST requests to the login form.
*   **Malicious Input:** Attackers inject SQL code into the `userid` and `password` parameters within the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No special privileges are needed; any user (or even an unauthenticated user) can exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:**
    ```php
    if ($_POST['userid'] && $_POST['password'])
    {
        // if the user has just tried to log in
        $logquery = "select * from users "
                ."where username='$userid' "
                ." and passwd='$password' ";
    }
    ```
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
    *   `username: ' or' 1=1`
    *   `password: ' or' 1=1`
    
    This PoC injects a tautology into the SQL query, effectively bypassing authentication.
