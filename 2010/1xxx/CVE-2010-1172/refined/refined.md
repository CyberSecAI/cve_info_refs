Here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2010-1172 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `dbus-glib` library did not properly enforce the "access" flag on exported GObject properties. This meant that a property intended to be read-only could be modified by a local user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The core issue is a flaw in how `dbus-glib` handled property access, specifically with read-only properties. The library failed to prevent write operations when properties were declared as read-only.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Modification:** A local attacker could modify an application's properties even if they were declared as read-only.
 -  **Denial of Service (DoS):** This could potentially lead to denial of service by changing critical configurations, causing application malfunction, or making a service unavailable.
- **Application Behavior Modification:** Changes to properties (e.g., IP address) could cause unintended behavior in the affected application.
 
**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would require the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system.
- **D-Bus Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited by interacting with a vulnerable application via D-Bus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the vulnerable application is running.
- **Ability to send D-Bus Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send dbus messages to the affected application.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Components:**  The primary components affected are `dbus-glib` itself and applications built using it, particularly NetworkManager (and gdm as noted by opensuse). This is because those applications make use of GObject properties and the way dbus-glib translates xml definitions into C code.
- **Mitigation:** Patches were applied to `dbus-glib` to enforce property access flags, and applications that were affected needed to be rebuilt against the patched version to fully address the issue.
- **Legacy Behavior:** A configuration option  (`dbus_glib_global_set_disable_legacy_property_access`) was provided to disable legacy behavior allowing access to properties.

**Content Specific Details:**
- **Red Hat:**  Red Hat's advisory (RHSA-2010:0616) and bugzilla entry (Bug 585394) specifically mention the vulnerability in `dbus-glib`, noting that the fix involved rebuilding `NetworkManager` and `dbus-glib`.
- **Avaya:** Avaya's advisory (ASA-2010-276) highlights the same flaw and indicates several Avaya products were affected and required upgrades or patching.
- **openSUSE:** openSUSE's security summary reports (SUSE-SR:2010:019 and SUSE-SR:2010:022) note that the flaw was fixed in `dbus-glib` and that `gdm` needed a rebuild to resolve it.
- **cgit.freedesktop.org:** The `cgit` entry details the commit in `dbus-glib` that addressed the vulnerability and enforces the access flags for properties. It also provides details on new function added to disable legacy behavior.
