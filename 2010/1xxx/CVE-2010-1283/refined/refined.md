        "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the parsing of 3D objects within Director files, specifically an undocumented 4-byte field in record type 0xFFFFFF49. This field can be modified to corrupt heap memory.",

        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious Director file and host it on a webpage.",
        "additional_information": "The file uses a RIFF-based format stored in big-endian format. The memory corruption can be leveraged to modify function pointers."
