{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of Director files, specifically within the handling of the 'pami' RIFF chunk. The application trusts an offset value provided within the chunk data and seeks into the file based on this offset. If signed values are provided at this offset, the process may miscalculate a pointer and operate on the data at an unintended location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper pointer calculation",
      "Lack of input validation on offset values within RIFF chunk",
      "Incorrect memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running the browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious Director file containing a crafted pami RIFF chunk. The victim must then be lured to open it or visit a website with an embedded malicious file.",
    "additional_information": "Adobe has released a patch addressing the vulnerability, which is detailed in the provided link."
