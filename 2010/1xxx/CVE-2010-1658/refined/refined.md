  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Joomla! Component NoticeBoard 1.3 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). The component improperly handles user-supplied input when processing the 'controller' parameter in a URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information, source code, configuration files, or even credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the 'controller' parameter in the URL, an attacker can include local files. The 'controller' parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing path traversal sequences such as '../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd'.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application. No authentication or special privileges are required."
