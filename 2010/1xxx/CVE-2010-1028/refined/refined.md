Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1028

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the Mozilla Web Open Fonts Format (WOFF) decoder. Specifically, it occurs during the processing of table sizes specified in the font file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The WOFF decoder incorrectly handles the size of tables within the font file, leading to an integer overflow when calculating the memory needed.
- Buffer Overflow: The integer overflow results in a memory allocation that is too small, leading to a buffer overflow when the font data is decompressed into the undersized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system, with the same privileges as the user running the browser. This could allow the attacker to take control of the user's computer, steal data, or install malware.
- Browser Crash: The buffer overflow can also cause the browser to crash if arbitrary code execution is not achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious WOFF File: An attacker can craft a malicious WOFF file that contains specially crafted table sizes that trigger the integer overflow and subsequent buffer overflow.
- Remote Attack: The malicious WOFF file can be delivered to the victim through a website, email, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Position: The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.
- Ability to deliver a malicious WOFF file: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into processing the malicious WOFF file. This could be through a website or by other means.
- No Authentication: The attack does not require the attacker to have any authentication credentials.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The vulnerability exists in the WOFF decoder, which was introduced in Firefox 3.6.
- The specific issue is in how the decoder handles the size of tables specified in the font file
- The vulnerability is exploitable due to how zlib is used to decompress the font data into the undersized buffer
- The vulnerability is triggered when a maliciously crafted WOFF file is processed by the browser.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Firefox 3.6.2 or later, which contains the fix for this issue.
-  Disable downloading of remote fonts via Firefox configuration by setting `gfx.downloadable_fonts.enabled` to `false`
