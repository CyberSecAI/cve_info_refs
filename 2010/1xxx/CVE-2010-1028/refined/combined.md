## Mozilla WOFF decoder integer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#964549

Original Release Date: 2010-03-23 | Last Revised: 2010-07-28

---

### Overview

An integer overflow in the Mozilla Web Open Fonts Format (WOFF) decoder may allow a remote attacker to execute code on an affected system.

### Description

| The Web Open Fonts Format (WOFF) is a simple compressed file format for fonts. Mozilla introduced support for WOFF in the 1.9.2 branch of the base software, which is used by Firefox versions 3.6 and later.  An integer overflow error exists in the way the WOFF decoder handles the size of tables specified in the font file. This error could result in a buffer overflow vulnerability on a subsequent memory allocation. A remote attacker who is able to supply a malicious WOFF file could exploit this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attack may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the victim user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Mozilla has addressed this issue in Firefox version 3.6.2. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version of the browser. |
| --- |

| **Disable downloading of remote fonts**  By performing the following steps, it is possible to prevent Mozilla from retrieving and displaying remote fonts.   1. Enter "about:config" into the browser's address bar. This will display Firefox's configuration values. 2. Set the following value to false:  gfx.downloadable\_fonts.enabled |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| Any Mozilla-derived product that uses the Mozilla 1.9.2 code could be affected. |

Mozilla is aware of the claim of a zero-day in Firefox as posted here: <http://secunia.com/advisories/38608/>.  We cannot confirm the report as we have received no details regarding the reported vulnerability, such as a proof-of-concept or steps to reproduce.  We’ve attempted to contact the researcher who discovered the issue but have not received a response.

Mozilla takes all reports of security vulnerabilities seriously.  As always, if you have information about security issues, please send details to security@mozilla.org.

    > Reporting a software vulnerability directly to it’s open-source creator–namely, Mozilla–is commonly accepted as best practice by today’s internet community. This is widely understood to be responsible disclosure, because it minimizes exposure of the end user to malicious attacks while Mozilla is developing, testing, and deploying a patch.

    > The publication of a security advisory, assignment of a highly critical vulnerability rating to that advisory, and Secunia’s widely respected reputation–all combine to inform belief that the alleged flaw is real. On the other hand, Mozilla’s own security researchers indicate the nature of the alleged exploitable flaw is unknown to them. They have no facts to act upon–namely, neither the steps required to reproduce the alleged exploit, nor a proof-of-concept pointing to an exploitable coding error. I do not doubt Mozilla’s word, because very few software vendors, if any, can claim to exceed Mozilla’s dedication to writing secure code, and Mozilla’s open record of diligence in fixing security holes in a timely manner.

    > Anyone–whether he lives in Moscow, Copenhagen, or elsewhere–who seeks recognition as a source of reliable vulnerability intelligence, and who possesses evidence that the Firefox 3.x code contains a security hole defined by the broad brush of SA38608, has an ethical obligation to slip the proof under Mozilla’s doormat, or to withdraw the accusation. To repeat: It is called responsible disclosure. Anything less is unacceptable.

# Update on Secunia Advisory SA38608

Lucas Adamski
March 18, 2010

[40 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2010/03/18/update-on-secunia-advisory-sa38608/#comments)

Mozilla was contacted by Evgeny Legerov, the security researcher who discovered the bug referenced in the Secunia report, with sufficient details to reproduce and analyze the issue.  The vulnerability was determined to be critical and could result in remote code execution by an attacker.  The vulnerability has been patched by developers and we are currently undergoing quality assurance testing for the fix.  Firefox 3.6.2 is scheduled to be released March 30th and will contain the fix for this issue.  As always, we encourage users to apply this update as soon as it is available to ensure a safe browsing experience.  Alternatively, users can download Release Candidate builds of Firefox 3.6.2 which contains the fix from here:  <https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/3.6.2-candidates/build3/>

**Update:** To clarify, as originally claimed this issue affects Firefox 3.6 only and not any earlier versions. Thunderbird and SeaMonkey are based on earlier versions of the browser engine and are not affected. People testing “3.7” development builds should upgrade to 3.7 alpha 3 or the latest nightly build to ensure they have this fix.

   > I’m currently using 3.6 and don’t want to use the beta. Would love to upgrade directly. Therefore, I’m a little concerned:). Thanks!

    > Firefox 3.6 sucks anyway: e.g. lots of buggy behavior, new tabs are opened in an unpredictable fashion, and there’s nothing better about 3.6 over 3.5. It doesn’t surprise me that there’s a critical vulnerability that was introduced in the 3.6 branch. I already reverted to the 3.5 branch weeks ago.

    > I think what you have to do is put yourself in the devs shoes. All sorts of people make all sorts of claims about exploits all the time. What do they do, go around buying every ‘exploit’ that Tom, Dick, and Harry claim to have every week? Its simply not reasonable to expect this and it wouldn’t even make sense. Now, they might be able to pay someone for information sometimes, but its going to have to be solidly credible before that happens. Beyond that no organization can possibly be aware of everything floating around in the world, it still has to come through some channel.
    >
    > Thus it seems like what the devs said was exactly what the reality is, they can’t do squat about Internet rumors and claims of vulnerabilities. They can only work on fixing actual documented vulnerabilities that have been verified to exist where they have the information in hand. Period.
    >
    > Beyond that there are a lot of reasons why its not a great idea to run around buying exploits. Who’s hands are you putting this money in and what are they doing with it? It sounds great in theory but in practice it probably isn’t all that great an idea. At best it has to be looked into on a case-by-case basis, and again that means every random guy that claims to have an ‘exploit’ to sell can’t even be looked into and still have time to do any real work.

    > Look, at least Mozilla is advancing their browser every couple or so months. Look at the competition (IE8), they have all kinds of problems, where’s IE9 at? It’s fine for a billionaire corporation not to upgrade, but when Mozilla, a corporation that operates largely on donations and staffed by a lot of volunteers, misses something, people cry bloody murder. I remember when Firefox was an absolute RAM hog, but has came a long way from that. IE8 was released around a year ago, it’s still the same piece of crap it was when released. An open door to viruses and malware.

    > @18 A hypothetical researcher who demands money for supplying the exploit details to the software publisher versus supplying details to the world’s hackers would be, if they took the latter course, guilty in respect of all the hacking subsequently done using the data. And a respectable researcher has a known business or home address. So someone who tries to blackmail with an exploit is taking a considerable risk. Then again, making a deal with established professional Internet criminals is a risk, too.

    > Several posters above have complained that Mozilla did not contact Secunia about this problem. It seems to me that if Secunia discovered and documented a problem with Firefox, that Secunia had an immediate obligation to provide all relevant information to the Firefox developers. To leave it up to Mozilla to take the initiative on this is totally irresponsible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Proof of concept](attachment.cgi?id=432357)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=432357&action=edit)

Evgeny L. from Vulndisco reported a crash due to a buffer overflow in our WOFF parser. I am able to reproduce the crash, but the stack I get doesn't appear to be in font parser code. I'll try it in a debug build shortly to see if it looks any different. Here's the crash report where it looks like we're calling null:
0bc35855-ee77-4c61-b469-c7c482100313
To reproduce, run the attached python script ff1.py and load
<http://localhost:8080/1.html>

Note that none of these crash signatures are closely associated with the woff-decoder bug (even though on 3.6, they may be caused by it). The bug is such that we end up using zlib to decompress into a too-small buffer; we therefore overwrite some other chunk of memory with the decomressed data; and subsequently crash when another part of the code makes use of its now-damaged data. So similar crash signatures could occur as a result of more or less any memory-stomping bug.
So all this tells us is that there must be something in 3.5.x that can trash memory in a vaguely similar way. It's certainly not the woff code in that case, as it isn't even present in the 1.9.1 tree. Maybe there's some other compressed-format decoder such as jpeg or png that can be fooled in a similar way? If we had a proof-of-concept that triggers the crashes on 3.5.x we could probably locate the problem there.

Do we need to allow orig length anywhere near 4G-3? Even given machines that can handle it that's a ridiculous font size -- no reasonable font will be anything close to that by several orders of magnitude and it allows an unreasonable font to suck up huge amounts of your resources. On OS X 10.5 the biggest font I have is 华文细黑.ttf at 17.4 Mb, followed by AppleGothic at 15. Half of 'em are under 1Mb.

Well, of course that's a ridiculous size; I'm not sure how we would pick an appropriate smaller limit, though. And if orig length of an individual table is that large, the file as a whole will fail sanityCheck a moment later as the total size will be excessive.

This patch is OK but I'd prefer a patch that just made offs, orig and comp all uint64\_t. That's a lot more robust.

Does this apply to 1.9.1 branch as well? Might not be good to ship this fix on 1.9.2 while leaving 1.9.1 vulnerable, if so.

So many that they all failed to notice the obvious flaw below before it landed (fixed in [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=552216#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - WOFF heap corruption due to integer overflow"))?
- if (tableTotal > 0xffffffffU - orig) {
+ tableTotal += orig;
+ if (tableTotal > 0xffffffffU) {
return eWOFF\_invalid;
}
tableTotal += orig;

It could be patched much more easy without inc of a bit's:
uint32\_t tableTotal = 0;
//...
uint32\_t orig = READ32BE(dirEntry->origLen);
//...
#define MAX(x,y) ((x)>(y)?(x):(y))
if ( tableTotal + orig < MAX(tableTotal,orig) )
{
return eWOFF\_invalid;
}
else
{
tableTotal += orig;
}

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-08

## WOFF heap corruption due to integer overflow

Announced
March 22, 2010
Reporter
Evgeny Legerov
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.2

### Description

Security researcher **Evgeny Legerov** of Intevydis
reported that the WOFF decoder contains an integer overflow in a
font decompression routine. This flaw could result in too small a
memory buffer being allocated to store a downloadable font. An
attacker could use this vulnerability to crash a victim's browser
and execute arbitrary code on his/her system.

Support for the WOFF downloadable font format
is new in Firefox 3.6 (Gecko 1.9.2); this vulnerability does not affect
products built on earlier versions of the Mozilla browser engine.
