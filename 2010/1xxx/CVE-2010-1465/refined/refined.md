The content is related to CVE-2010-1465.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Trellian FTP Client due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the PASV command response from an FTP server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow triggered by a specially crafted PASV command response. Specifically, the server response includes an overly long IP address/port specification that overflows a buffer in the client when parsed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client machine. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the victim's system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote. An attacker would set up a malicious FTP server, then trick a user into connecting to it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious FTP server, and then trick a user into connecting to it with a vulnerable client. The attacker needs to create a specially crafted payload and incorporate it into the PASV command response.
