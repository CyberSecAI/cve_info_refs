Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists due to the way Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files. Specifically, it's related to how Excel handles the `HFPicture` record within the Excel file format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** A specially crafted Excel file can trigger memory corruption when parsed by Excel.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The memory corruption can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution on the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Attack:** An attacker can send a malicious Excel file to a user and convince them to open it.
*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious Excel file. The attacker would need to convince the victim to visit the site and open the file. Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also be used to host the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Excel file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to deliver the crafted file to the victim, either through email or by hosting it on a website.
*   The attacker does not need any special access or privileges on the victim's machine. The vulnerability is triggered when the user opens the malicious file.

**Additional Notes from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" and not "Critical" due to the user having to open a file to be exploited.
*   Mitigating factors:
    *   Users with limited rights are less affected.
    *   Exploitation through web requires user interaction.
    *   Vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically via email.
*   Workarounds:
    *   Do not open untrusted Excel files
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by changing how Excel parses specially crafted files.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released and there was no indication of it being actively exploited.
