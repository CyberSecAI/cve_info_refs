Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the `com_travelbook` component of Joomla. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The primary weakness is the ability to include local files by manipulating the `controller` parameter in the URL. This allows the attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- File Disclosure: An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, source code, or system files like `/etc/passwd`. This can lead to further compromise of the system or application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request Manipulation: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP request.
- URL Parameter Injection: Specifically, the `controller` parameter in the URL is used to inject the file path to be included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
- Basic Knowledge of LFI: The attacker needs to be aware of the LFI vulnerability and understand how to craft a malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit string `http://localhost/[path]/index.php?option=com_travelbook&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` demonstrates how to include the `/etc/passwd` file by using relative path traversal and null byte injection.
- Vulnerable Software: Joomla Component TRAVELbook version 1.0.1
