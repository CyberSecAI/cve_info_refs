How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: python-cjson

There is a buffer overrun in cjson 1.0.5, on UCS4 builds. The string length is only resized for wide unicode characters if there is less than 12 bytes of space left. Padding with narrow-but-escaped characters prevents string resizing.

The following line exhibits the overrun (it \*may\* segfault or display garbage, etc):

>>> cjson.encode(u'\U0001D11E\U0001D11E\U0001D11E\U0001D11E\u1234\u1234\u1234\u1234\u1234\u1234')

(u'\U0001D11E\u1234' also breaks, but sometimes goes undetected.)

I've attached a Bazaar merge directive against [lp:ubuntu/hardy/python-cjson](/%2Bcode/ubuntu/hardy/python-cjson) as a potential security vulnerability, and will also send the patch upstream.

By the way, this seems to affect all versions of cjson (at least on all supported Ubuntu versions). I patched against Hardy, being the oldest supported version -- not sure if I was supposed to patch against Maverick instead, but I expect this will be applied to all supported versions, right?

OK I've talked to wgrant and he explained how to submit a security patch -- I've now attached three patches (one for hardy, one for jaunty and one for karmic which should merge into lucid and maverick), and each patch also updates the debian/changelog. Ignore the original patch.

Also note that I am aware that my test case reinforces the incorrect behaviour of encoding \U00xxxxxx (should encode to surrogate pairs). I have created a separate patch for this and will send it upstream.

Thanks for your patch! In the future can you please follow <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/SponsorsQueue#Notes%20for%20Contributors>? This went unnoticed for a little while because ubuntu-security-sponsors was not subscribed. I've done that now.

Hi Jamie,

Ah thanks for that advice. I was wondering if I was missing out on informing someone.

Unfortunately, I can't give a link to the upstream report because as far as I can tell, there is no upstream bug tracker or source tree for cjson. I based my patch on the version 1.0.5 release (<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-cjson>), and by "sent upstream", I meant I emailed the patches to the author, Dan Pascu <email address hidden>. I haven't heard a reply from him in two weeks.

The Ubuntu/Debian package seems to be derived from this same public release (as there is 0 diff between the public release code and the source package's code).

Ok, since upstream is unresponsive, I will need to coordinate this with vendors then.

Hi. I'm not familiar with the security procedures, but I wanted to check what's happening with this bug. There was a suggested CRD of 2010-06-16 (two days ago), and on the mailing list it was assigned a CVE number. As far as I can tell, nothing happened and the patch doesn't seem to have been reviewed.

I haven't dealt with a security vulnerability before, so I don't know if this is unusual or not.

Also, should the Launchpad bug report be linked to the CVE given on the mailing list, or is that only after the bug is disclosed?

Matt,

FYI, I had to update the debdiffs to use versions that comply with <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePreparation#Packaging>. This is needed to ensure smoothe upgrades.

Package        : python-cjson
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2010-1666
Debian Bug     : 587700

Matt Giuca discovered a buffer overflow in python-cjson, a fast JSON
encoder/decoder for Python.
This allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash)
through a specially-crafted Python script.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.5-1+lenny1

For the testing (squeeze) and the unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
has been fixed in version 1.0.5-3

We recommend that you upgrade your python-cjson package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
