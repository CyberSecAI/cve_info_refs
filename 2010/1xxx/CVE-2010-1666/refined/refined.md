{
  "CVE-2010-1666": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the python-cjson library when encoding wide unicode characters on UCS4 builds. Specifically, the string length is not correctly resized for wide unicode characters, especially when padding with escaped characters. This allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a specially crafted Python script.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect buffer resizing when encoding wide unicode characters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Incorrect string length calculation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to application crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a specially crafted python script with specific unicode sequences to the python-cjson library.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to execute python scripts that leverage the vulnerable cjson library."
