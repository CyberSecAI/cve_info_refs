Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1876:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `exploit-db.com` explicitly mentions "CVE-2010-1876" and details a SQL injection vulnerability in "AJ Shopping Cart 1.0". This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `maincatid` parameter of the `showmaincatlanding` action within the AJ Shopping Cart application. This parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization of the `maincatid` parameter before it's used in a SQL query.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Retrieving sensitive data from the database, including admin credentials (`admin_name`, `admin_password`). The exploit specifically targets the `admin_table` to extract this information.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** Potentially gaining control of the server, depending on the database permissions and the system's configuration.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `showmaincatlanding` action, injecting SQL code into the `maincatid` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges or authentication is required to exploit this.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   **Exploit Payload:** The provided exploit demonstrates a SQL injection using a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement:
    ```
    -99999/**/union/**/all/**/select/**/group_concat(admin_name,char(58),admin_password)v3n0m/**/from/**/admin_table--
    ```
    This payload is designed to extract admin usernames and passwords from the `admin_table`.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `maincatid` parameter in the URL is the injection point:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1/[path]/?do=featured&action=showmaincatlanding&maincatid=[SQLi]
    ```
*   **Password Encryption:** The passwords in the database are reportedly encrypted using "base64_encode".

**4. Additional Notes:**
* The exploit-db entry provides specific instructions on the vulnerable URL and payload, providing a working exploit example.
* The exploit-db content is more detailed than a basic CVE description, offering a functional exploit for testing purposes.

**In summary, CVE-2010-1876 is a SQL Injection vulnerability in AJ Shopping Cart 1.0, stemming from a lack of input sanitization on the `maincatid` parameter. Successful exploitation allows for data exfiltration, manipulation and potentially complete server compromise.**
