    {
      "type": "apple_security_advisory",
      "details": {
        "vulnerability": "Open Directory",
        "available_for": "Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.3, Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.3",
        "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker may be able to impersonate a network account server",
        "description": "When binding to a network account server via System Preferences, Open Directory will automatically negotiate an unprotected connection to the server if it is not possible to connect to the server with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). A man-in-the-middle attacker may be able to impersonate the network account server, which may lead to arbitrary code execution with system privileges. This issue is addressed by providing an option to require a secure connection.",
          "root_cause": "Open Directory automatically negotiates an unprotected connection to the server if SSL is not possible.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Man-in-the-middle attack due to lack of secure connection enforcement"
        ],
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Network based, man-in-the-middle attack"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the network account server.",
