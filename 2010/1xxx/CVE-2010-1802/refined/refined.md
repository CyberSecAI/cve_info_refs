- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of certificate host names in libsecurity. When hostnames contain three or more components, the last characters are not properly compared, leading to potential impersonation. Specifically, in a three component name, only the very last character is not checked.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate validation of the last characters in certificate hostnames during comparisons, leading to potential hostname spoofing
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a privileged network position, who can obtain a domain name that differs only in the last characters from the name of a legitimate domain, may impersonate hosts in that domain. For example, an attacker with a certificate for "www.example.con" can impersonate "www.example.com".
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker is in a privileged network position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to obtain a domain name similar to the target, with differences only in the last characters, and be in a privileged network position to intercept and redirect connections.
