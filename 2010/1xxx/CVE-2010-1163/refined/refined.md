{
  "CVE-2010-1163": {
    "Description": "Sudo's path resolution code did not add a \"./\" prefix to commands found in the current working directory. This creates an ambiguity between a `sudoedit` command found in the current working directory and the `sudoedit` pseudo-command in the sudoers file. As a result, a user may be able to run an arbitrary command named `sudoedit` in the current working directory.",
    "Root cause": "The sudo path resolution code did not prepend './' to commands in the CWD, causing ambiguity with the sudoedit pseudo-command.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect path resolution",
      "Ambiguity between pseudo-commands and commands in the CWD"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation to root by executing arbitrary commands.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker, executes a crafted command named `sudoedit` in the current directory",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user with permission to run `sudoedit` and the PATH environment variable must include '.' and not contain any directory that contains a `sudoedit` command"
  }
