Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1056:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `com_rokdownloads` component of Joomla. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The component does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the `controller` parameter to include local files.
- Lack of input validation: The `controller` parameter is not validated before being used to construct a file path, leading to the LFI vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Access: An attacker can read any files accessible by the web server user, including sensitive configuration files, system files (such as `/etc/passwd`), and application source code. This can lead to full compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to a vulnerable Joomla site, specifically targeting the `com_rokdownloads` component.
- URL Manipulation: The attacker injects a relative path using `..` sequences, and a null byte terminator `%00` into the `controller` parameter, allowing the attacker to traverse directories and reach sensitive files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla server.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable component: The attacker must be aware of the presence of `com_rokdownloads` and the vulnerable parameter.
- No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details**
- The provided exploit demonstrates a typical LFI attack by using `../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` as the malicious `controller` parameter. This attempts to navigate to the `/etc/passwd` file on the server, which is often a prime target for attackers.
