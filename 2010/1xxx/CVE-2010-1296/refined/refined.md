CVE-2010-1296:
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended application fails to properly sanitize user input when handling .GRD (gradients) and .ABR (brushes) format files, leading to memory corruption.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- Impact of exploitation: Memory corruption leading to potential arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- Attack vectors:
    - Opening a specially crafted .GRD or .ABR file via the vulnerable application.
    - This can be done remotely.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to create a malicious .GRD or .ABR file. No special privileges are required. The attacker would need to lure the user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable application.

Additional notes:
The exploit-db entries provide proof-of-concept code (Perl, C) to generate malicious .GRD and .ABR files. The provided files contain more details, including stack traces of the crashes, than the original CVE description.
