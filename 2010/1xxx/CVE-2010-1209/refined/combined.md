| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

ZDI-CAN-712: Mozilla Firefox NodeIterator Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the victim must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of the NodeIterator interface for traversal of the Document Object Model. Due to the implementation requiring a javascript callback, an attacker can utilize the callback in order to manipulate the contents of the page. By doing so in an unexpected manner, an attacker can cause the process to corrupt memory. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution under the context of the application.
The particular issue is located within Mozilla Firefox's implemenation of Document Traversal and involves both the NodeFilter and NodeIterator interfaces. The NodeIterator interface allows one to specify a NodeFilter in order to allow a finer granularity of control over which nodes will be traversed.
A NodeIterator's interface as specified at (<http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/traversal.html#Traversal-NodeIterator>) is defined as:
// Introduced in DOM Level 2:
interface NodeIterator {
readonly attribute Node root;
readonly attribute unsigned long whatToShow;
readonly attribute NodeFilter filter;
readonly attribute boolean expandEntityReferences;
Node nextNode()
raises(DOMException);
Node previousNode()
raises(DOMException);
void detach();
};
This interface contains two methods which are used to trigger this vulnerability. The first one is the 'filter' property. This is a readonly attribute that's set on creation of a NodeIterator. The next one is detach() which will detach a node from the tree. The implementation of this primarily resides within content/base/src/nsNodeIterator.cpp.
Creation of a NodeIterator first starts within the following snippet.
One of the parameters is the specified filter.
content/base/src/nsDocument.cpp:4767
NS\_IMETHODIMP
nsDocument::CreateNodeIterator(nsIDOMNode \*aRoot,
PRUint32 aWhatToShow,
nsIDOMNodeFilter \*aFilter, // XXX
PRBool aEntityReferenceExpansion,
nsIDOMNodeIterator \*\*\_retval)
{
\*\_retval = nsnull;
if (!aRoot)
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_NOT\_SUPPORTED\_ERR;
nsresult rv = nsContentUtils::CheckSameOrigin(this, aRoot);
NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
NS\_ENSURE\_ARG\_POINTER(\_retval);
nsCOMPtr<nsINode> root = do\_QueryInterface(aRoot);
NS\_ENSURE\_TRUE(root, NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_NOT\_SUPPORTED\_ERR);
nsNodeIterator \*iterator = new nsNodeIterator(root,
aWhatToShow,
aFilter, // XXX
aEntityReferenceExpansion);
This will then instantiated a new NodeIterator which will then create an nsTraversal object which will utilize the specified filter and store it as one of it's properties.
content/base/src/nsNodeIterator.cpp:183
nsNodeIterator::nsNodeIterator(nsINode \*aRoot,
PRUint32 aWhatToShow,
nsIDOMNodeFilter \*aFilter,
PRBool aExpandEntityReferences) :
nsTraversal(aRoot, aWhatToShow, aFilter, aExpandEntityReferences),
// XXX
mDetached(PR\_FALSE),
mPointer(mRoot, PR\_TRUE)
{
aRoot->AddMutationObserver(this);
}
Iteration of a NodeIterator is then performed via the nextNode() and prevNode() methods. The implementation of the nextNode() method is located in the following file. If there is a filter, this code will ask the filter function if the node is valid, and if so will return it. To accomplish this, the application will use the TestNode method.
content/base/src/nsNodeIterator.cpp:264
/\* nsIDOMNode nextNode () raises (DOMException); \*/
NS\_IMETHODIMP nsNodeIterator::NextNode(nsIDOMNode \*\*\_retval)
{
nsresult rv;
PRInt16 filtered;
\*\_retval = nsnull;
if (mDetached)
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INVALID\_STATE\_ERR;
mWorkingPointer = mPointer;
while (mWorkingPointer.MoveToNext(mRoot)) {
nsCOMPtr<nsINode> testNode = mWorkingPointer.mNode;
rv = TestNode(testNode, &filtered); // XXX
NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
if (filtered == nsIDOMNodeFilter::FILTER\_ACCEPT) {
mPointer = mWorkingPointer;
mWorkingPointer.Clear();
return CallQueryInterface(testNode, \_retval);
}
}
mWorkingPointer.Clear();

I'm missing something here. What evidence indicates that freed memory has been accessed and/or that memory has been corrupted? When/where was that memory freed, and when/where is it accessed, specifically? The proof of concept is a bit hand-wavy, to say the least.
I'm not questioning the legitimacy of the vulnerability. I just want to be sure we're all talking about the same memory.

I think I can see a way where we could crash here. Though the reasons for the crash is quite different from the description of the original reporter.
So I think that if you call detach() from within the filter, we'll stop observing the document. However we'll still be traversing the document until we find a useful node.
So steps to attack would be something like:
1. Create a nodeiterator with a nodefilter which always returns FILTER\_ACCEPT
2. Iterate to a node, X, that is a \*grand\*child of the root
3. Change the nodefilter to upon call do the following
i) call detach() on the nodeiterator
ii) remove X parent from its parent
iii) drop any references to X or its parent
iv) do enough stuff that we GC (for example perform a sync XHR)
v) return FILTER\_SKIP
4. At this point we should be attempting to traverse the tree, but the nodes
we're attempting to traverse are GCed and we should crash
Not sure what the best way to fix this is. Probably to not remove the mutation observer until after we've found a new node if detach() is called while we're inside NextNode or PreviousNode
3. Call nodeiterator.next()

Alternatively, after every call to TestNode always check mDetached and bail if it's true.

Because most ZDIs we get (save maybe one or two) have been valid security bugs (mostly sg:critical, too). Based on that reputation, we should preemptively block to ensure we get this fixed in the next scheduled release.

Jonas, this patch addresses the scenario you described.
Change summary:
\* Consolidated code that was duplicated between NextNode and PreviousNode into NextOrPrevNode.
\* Calling .detach() in the filter function now causes the current .nextNode() or .previousNode() call to return null (another option would be to throw the NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INVALID\_STATE\_ERR exception).
\* The call to mRoot->RemoveMutationObserver(this) is now postponed until the nsNodeIterator destructor, whereas previously the observer was removed immediately in Detach.
\* Any mutation events after the .detach() call are ignored.

The safest thing would probably be to simply return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INVALID\_STATE\_ERR here. Especially if you add mWorkingPointer.Clear() to nsNodeIterator::Detach

Why remove this? Having extra mutation observers costs us perf-wise so it'd be nice to keep it. Seems like it should be safe to do so with your other changes. Then you can also remove the changes to nsNodeIterator::ContentInserted/ContentRemoved
Would love to see some tests here too. At least attached to this bug for now until it's safe to check in on trunk.
Minusing for now, feel free to rerequest if there's something you don't agree with.

I guess so. Could there ever be any sane reason for calling .detach() from the filter function?
> Especially if you add mWorkingPointer.Clear() to nsNodeIterator::Detach
I'd rather call mWorkingPointer.Clear() in NextOrPrevNode, just before returning the error. mWorkingPointer is supposed to be valid for the duration of NextOrPrevNode, so invalidating it in some other method seems sneaky.
I also noticed that we don't call mWorkingPointer.Clear() when the NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS fails, so I fixed that as well.

I'd love to have some tests, too, but I have a feeling it's going to be tricky. I'll look into that...

Actually, I just realized that this fix might not be good enough :(
Consider the following steps:
1. Create a nodeiterator with a nodefilter which always returns FILTER\_ACCEPT
2. Iterate to a node, X, that is a \*grand\*child of the root
3. Change the nodefilter to upon call do the following
i) call detach() on the nodeiterator
ii) remove X parent from its parent
iii) drop any references to X or its parent
iv) cause a GC
v) call nodeiterator.next()
4. At this point we attempt to traverse the tree, but the nodes
we're attempting to traverse are GCed and we should crash
Note here that we're calling nodeiterator.next from \*inside\* the filter.

Err.. never mind. The first thing we do in the iteration functions is to see if we've detached and then just bail.

No, the issue here is that black hats can benefit from the tests in order to construct exploits...

## Mozilla Firefox NodeIterator Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-130ZDI-CAN-712

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-1209](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1209) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [3.6.x](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['10006']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the victim must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of the NodeIterator interface for traversal of the Document Object Model. Due to the implementation requiring a javascript callback, an attacker can utilize the callback in order to manipulate the contents of the page. By doing so in an unexpected manner, an attacker can cause the process to corrupt memory. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution under the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2010/mfsa2010-36.html> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-03-12 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-07-20 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-36

## Use-after-free error in NodeIterator

Announced
July 20, 2010
Reporter
regenrecht (via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative)
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.11
* Firefox 3.6.7
* SeaMonkey 2.0.6

### Description

Security researcher **regenrecht** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in Mozilla's
implementation of `NodeIterator` in which a
malicious `NodeFilter` could be created which would detach
nodes from the DOM tree while it was being traversed. The use of a
detached and subsequently deleted node could result in the execution
of attacker-controlled memory.
