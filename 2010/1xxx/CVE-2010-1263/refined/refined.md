  "CVE-2010-1263": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Improper validation of COM objects during instantiation by Microsoft Office, Windows Shell and WordPad.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate validation of COM objects"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote code execution. Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted Excel, Word, Visio, Publisher, or PowerPoint file (Microsoft Office)",
         "Opening a specially crafted file using WordPad",
         "Opening or selecting a shortcut file located on a network or WebDAV share (Windows Shell)."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file. In the case of Windows Shell exploitation, the attacker would need to convince users to visit a network/WebDAV share and click on a malicious shortcut."
    },
