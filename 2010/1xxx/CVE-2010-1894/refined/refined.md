Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the way the Windows kernel-mode drivers handle certain exceptions. Specifically, the drivers do not properly handle these exceptions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper exception handling in Windows kernel-mode drivers (win32k.sys).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. This grants them complete control over the affected system.
- **Full System Compromise:**  An attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: An attacker needs to log on to the affected system locally.
- The attacker must then run a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid logon credentials.
- The attacker needs the ability to log on locally to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a specially crafted application.
