```
Root cause of vulnerability: The Joomla! SmartSite component version 1.0.0 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient input validation.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: LFI vulnerability.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks.
Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'controller' parameter in the URL, an attacker can include arbitrary local files.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! installation, and be aware of the vulnerable component.
