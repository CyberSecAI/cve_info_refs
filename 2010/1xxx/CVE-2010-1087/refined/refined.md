Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1087:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies within the Linux kernel's NFS (Network File System) implementation, specifically in the `nfs_wait_on_request()` function. The VM/VFS layer expects `mapping->a_ops->invalidatepage()` to always succeed, but `nfs_wb_page_cancel()` can fail if a fatal signal occurs during file truncation. Because the NFS code assumes the page remains mapped during writeback, a failure can lead to an "Oops" (kernel panic).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core vulnerability is the assumption that a page will stay mapped during writeback operations in NFS.
- A race condition exists where a fatal signal during a file truncation can cause `nfs_wb_page_cancel()` to fail.
- The VM/VFS layer's inability to handle the failure of `mapping->a_ops->invalidatepage()` is a critical weakness.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a kernel "Oops", which is a kernel panic, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by truncating a file over NFS while a fatal signal is also delivered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User**: A local user on the system, with the ability to trigger the file truncation and send fatal signals to the process.
- **Access to NFS share:** Ability to interact with the NFS server and mount a file share.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `fs/nfs/pagelist.c` within the `nfs_wait_on_request()` function.
- The fix involves converting `nfs_wait_on_request()` to be uninterruptible, similar to `wait_on_page_writeback()`, to ensure consistent mapping during writeback operations.

**Additional information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Linux distributions, including Red Hat, SUSE and Debian.
- Patches were released to address this issue.
