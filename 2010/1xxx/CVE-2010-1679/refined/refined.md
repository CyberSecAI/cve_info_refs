Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how `dpkg-source` (a component of the `dpkg` package management system) handles paths and symlinks when unpacking source packages, specifically those using the "3.0 quilt" format.
-  It was discovered that `dpkg-source` did not correctly handle certain paths and symlinks in patches of source packages, which could make it traverse directories. Additionally, it was found that symbolic links in the .pc directory are followed, also allowing directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The core issue is a directory traversal vulnerability. By crafting malicious source packages with specific paths or symlinks, an attacker can force `dpkg-source` to write files to locations outside of the intended unpack directory.
- **Improper Handling of Paths/Symlinks:** The vulnerability is due to the insufficient validation and handling of relative paths and symlinks during the unpacking process of source packages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Modification:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to modify files outside the target unpack directory. This is a serious security flaw because it provides an avenue for the attacker to overwrite or manipulate files on the system.
- **Denial of Service:** This file modification could lead to denial-of-service conditions by corrupting system files or essential configurations.
- **Potential System Access:**  The attacker could potentially gain access to the system through the arbitrary file modification by overwriting sensitive files, injecting malicious code, or setting up backdoors.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Source Package:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted source package that exploits the identified vulnerabilities in `dpkg-source`.
- **Tricked User/Automated System:** An attacker would have to trick a user or an automated system into unpacking this malicious source package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create source packages:** The attacker needs the ability to create a source package with malicious paths or symlinks.
- **Social Engineering/Compromise:**  The attacker needs a way to get the victim to unpack the malicious package, this might involve social engineering tactics or exploiting existing system compromises.

**Additional details from the content:**
- This vulnerability only impacts source packages using the "3.0 quilt" format at unpack-time.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jakub Wilk and Raphael Hertzog.
- Fixes were applied in `scripts/Dpkg/Source/Archive.pm`, `scripts/Dpkg/Source/Patch.pm`, `scripts/Dpkg/Source/Package/V2.pm`
- Ubuntu releases affected by this vulnerability include Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04, and 10.10.
- Debian also released a security advisory (DSA-2142-1) regarding this vulnerability and new dpkg packages to fix this directory traversal issue.
