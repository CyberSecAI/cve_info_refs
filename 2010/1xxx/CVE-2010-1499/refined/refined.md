{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `genre_artists.php` script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (usernames, passwords, emails) and user levels, potentially leading to full administrative access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through the `id` parameter of the `genre_artists.php` script by injecting a crafted SQL query string. The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter via the GET method.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint `genre_artists.php`."
