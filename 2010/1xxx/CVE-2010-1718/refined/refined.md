        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The component directly includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information, arbitrary code execution, and complete system compromise.",
        "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request with the 'controller' parameter pointing to a local file path.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application."
