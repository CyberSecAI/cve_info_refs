  "CVE-2010-1905": {
    "Description": "Consona (formerly SupportSoft) Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS) contains a set of vulnerabilities that collectively could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system.",
    "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in different components of Consona IAS.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `ns6plugindestructor.asp`.",
      "Unsafe methods provided by `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`).",
      "Buffer overflow in `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`).",
      "Local privilege elevation in Repair Service (`tgsrv.exe`)."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user, and possibly gain SYSTEM privileges via the Repair Service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email message).",
       "Exploiting the XSS vulnerability to instantiate the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` control.",
      "Using unsafe methods of `SdcUser.TgConCtl` to download and execute arbitrary programs.",
      "Using the Repair Service to elevate privileges."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious HTML document and convince a user to open it. Knowledge of the vulnerable components and how to exploit them is also required."
