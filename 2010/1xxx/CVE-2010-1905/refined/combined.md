How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Consona (formerly SupportSoft) Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS) cross-site scripting, ActiveX, and Repair Service vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#602801

Original Release Date: 2010-05-06 | Last Revised: 2010-05-18

---

### Overview

Consona (formerly SupportSoft) Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS) contains a set of vulnerabilities that collectively could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system.

### Description

| In 2009, Consona acquired SupportSoft's enterprise software assets, including web-based assistance software called Intelligent Assistance Suite ([IAS](http://www.supportsoft.com/Downloads/PDF/brochures/IAS_for_DSP_2008.pdf)). IAS client components are delivered via ActiveX controls, Netscape-style plugins, or standalone installers. IAS runs on Microsoft Windows platforms. Consona products affected by these vulnerabilities include Consona Live Assistance, Consona Dynamic Agent, Consona Subscriber Assistance, Repair Manager, Consona Subscriber Activiation, and Subscriber Agent.  IAS contains vulnerabilities in different components.   1. Cross-site scripting (XSS) in ns6plugindestructor.asp 2. Unsafe methods provided by SdcUser.TgConCtl ActiveX control (tgctlcm.dll) 3. Buffer overflow in SdcUser.TgConCtl ActiveX control (tgctlcm.dll) 4. Local privilege elevation in Repair Service (tgsrv.exe) (only installed on Windows Vista and Windows 7)  Using several of these vulnerabilities, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. For example, the XSS vulnerability can be used to instantiate the SdcUser.TgConCtl control, which then can be used to download and execute arbitrary programs using the unsafe methods provided by the control. The Repair Service can be used to elevate from user (or Low-Rights IE) privileges to SYSTEM.Further details are available in Rubén Santamarta's [slides](http://www.wintercore.com/downloads/rootedcon_0day.pdf) from Rooted CON 2010. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email message), an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user, and possibly gain SYSTEM privileges via the Repair Service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply patches**Sites providing IAS/Consona support services should apply the appropriate patches referenced in the [April 2010 Security Bulletin](http://www.consona.com/Content/CRM/Support/SecurityBulletin_April2010.pdf). |
| --- |

| **Remove n6plugindestructor.asp**To remove the initial cross-site scripting vector, sites providing IAS/Consona support services can remove ns6plugindestructor.asp from the support web site. Removing this file is unlikely to reduce functionality, but may have side effects.**Limit domain access to the SdcUser.TgConCtl ActiveX control**SupportSoft ActiveX controls can only be scripted from sites that contain valid license information. Following the guidance in the [April 2010 Security Bulletin](http://www.consona.com/Content/CRM/Support/SecurityBulletin_April2010.pdf), sites providing IAS/Consona support services can augment domain access restrictions by listing allowed domains in the Windows registry and hosting controls using HTTPS to reduce the possibility of DNS spoofing attacks.**Disable the SdcUser.TgConCtl ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**Web clients of IAS/Consona support services can disable the vulnerable ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:{01113300-3E00-11D2-8470-0060089874ED}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in Microsoft Support Document [240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .reg file and imported into the Windows registry:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{01113300-3E00-11D2-8470-0060089874ED}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400Disabling this control will likely reduce functionality. |

# We believe in

Wirecore is a Estonian private company created to manage its own assets. The company's goal is to preserve, diversify and increase equity capital with well balanced risk.

# OurPrinciples

* Use of own capital only
* For our investments, we do not attract capital from outside, we use only the ownerâs capital

* Pure origin of money
* All capital at our disposal has a clean, fully traceable origin from risk-free sources

* Diversification
* We carefully diversify capital by investing both in very low-risk assets, such as real estate, and in high-risk short-term trading operations, such as foreign exchange markets

* Well balanced risks
* For high-risk transactions, we use a very small part of the capital, preferring to store most of the capital in the form of highly liquid assets that are constantly rising in price

* Only bona fide counterparties
* We carefully select only the best partners and always check where the money comes from, avoiding all sources even with potential risks

# CounterpartiesInteraction

**We interact with counterparties in just a few situations:**

* - buying or selling real estate
* - buying or selling other property
* - renting out real estate
* - property maintenance
* - brokers for trading operations
