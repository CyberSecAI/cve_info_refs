{
  "CVE-2010-1646": {
    "description": "The secure path feature and group handling in sudo allow local attackers to escalate privileges.",
    "root_cause": "Sudo's 'secure path' feature did not properly handle multiple PATH environment variables. It would replace the first instance of PATH but some programs (like bash) would use the last instance, allowing an attacker to bypass the secure path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient environment sanitization",
      "Inconsistent handling of environment variables"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation. Attackers could potentially execute commands with the privileges of other users, including root, depending on the configuration, if sudo was configured with a secure path and the user was granted permission to run a command that uses its own environment handling, like a bash script.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the environment of the process that executes sudo to include multiple PATH variables"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to manipulate the environment variables of a process. User with sudo privileges to run a command.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in sudo versions 1.3.1 through 1.6.9p22 and 1.7.0 through 1.7.2p6. The issue was fixed in sudo versions 1.6.9p23 and 1.7.2p7. The secure path option must be enabled in sudoers or at compile time for the vulnerability to be exploitable. The vulnerability was reported by Evan Broder and Anders Kaseorg of Ksplice, Inc."
