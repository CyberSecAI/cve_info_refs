  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-1909",
      "description": "Consona (formerly SupportSoft) Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS) contains a set of vulnerabilities that collectively could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system.",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in different components of the Consona Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS).",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `ns6plugindestructor.asp`.",
        "Unsafe methods provided by the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`).",
        "Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`).",
        "Local privilege elevation vulnerability in the Repair Service (`tgsrv.exe`), which is only installed on Windows Vista and Windows 7."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user, and potentially gain SYSTEM privileges via the Repair Service. This can be achieved by convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email message).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) via a crafted web page or HTML email message to instantiate the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
        "Exploitation of unsafe methods or buffer overflow in the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control to download and execute arbitrary programs.",
         "Local privilege escalation by exploiting the Repair Service."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a webpage or HTML email). For privilege escalation the attacker needs to have a user level account on a vulnerable system. ",
       "additional_information": "The XSS vulnerability can be used to instantiate the SdcUser.TgConCtl control, which then can be used to download and execute arbitrary programs using the unsafe methods provided by the control. The Repair Service can be used to elevate from user (or Low-Rights IE) privileges to SYSTEM."
