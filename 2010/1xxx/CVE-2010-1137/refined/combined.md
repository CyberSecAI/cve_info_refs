##### 3. Problem Description

a. WebAccess Context Data Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability

A cross-site scripting vulnerability in WebAccess allows for disclosure of sensitive information. The flaw is due to insufficient verification of certain parameters which may lead to redirection of a user's requests.
This vulnerability can only be exploited if the attacker tricks the WebAccess user into clicking a malicious link and the attacker has control of a server on the same network as the system where WebAccess is being used.
Workaround By switching off WebAccess the issue can no longer be exploited.Â  This can be accomplished on affected versions of Virtual Center and ESX as follows:
Virtual Center 2.0.2 and Virtual Center 2.5:
Go to the Windows Services overview on the system that runs Virtual Center.
To stop WebAccess without a reboot:
Change the status of the VMware Infrastructure Web Access service to stop
To prevent WebAccess from starting after the next reboot:
Change the startup type of the VMware Infrastructure Web Access service to disabled
ESX 3.0.3 and ESX 3.5:
Open a root shell on ESX.
To stop WebAccess without a reboot:
service vmware-webAccess stop
To prevent WebAccess from starting after the next reboot:
chkconfig vmware-webAccess off
VMware would like to thank David Byrne and Tom Leavey of Trustwave's SpiderLabs for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2009-2277 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

\* Use the workaround of disabling WebAccess to remediate the issue.

\*\* Hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the Service Console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see <http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726> for more information on VMware security best practices.

#####

b. WebAccess Virtual Machine Name Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability

A cross-site scripting vulnerability allows for execution of JavaScript in the Web browser's security context for WebAccess. The flaw is due to insufficient checking on the names of virtual machines.
In order to exploit the issue, the attacker must have control over the naming of a virtual machine and must have the user list this Virtual Machine in WebAccess.
Workaround
By switching off WebAccess the issue can no longer be exploited. See section 3.a on how this can be accomplished.
VMware would like to thank Craig Marshall of Ernst and Young Advanced Security Center for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-1137 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

##### VMware Product =============

\* The issue is remediated in Virtual Center 2.5 Update 4 and later. The issue is remediated on ESX 3.5 by patch ESX350-200903223-UG and by later ESX 3.5 WebAccess patches. The latest ESX 3.5 WebAccess patch is ESX350-201003403-SG.

\*\* Use the workaround of disabling WebAccess to remediate the issue.

\*\*\* In VMware Server 1.0 there is no WebAccess. The corresponding functionality is offered through the VMware Server Console.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the Service Console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see <http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726> for more information on VMware security best practices.

#####

c. WebAccess URL Forwarding Vulnerability

The WebAccess component doesn't sufficiently validate user supplied input and allows for forwarding of an incoming request to another destination. The destination will not be able to see the true origin of the request URL but instead will see the address of the machine that runs WebAccess. An attacker could use the forwarding vulnerability to direct traffic at servers while disguising the source location.
The security issue is limited to URL forwarding. This vulnerability doesn't allow for a so-called cross-site scripting attack and doesn't allow for stealing of the user cookies.
Workaround
By switching off WebAccess the issue can no longer be exploited. See section 3.a on how this can be accomplished.
VMware would like to thank John Fitzpatrick of MWR InfoSecurity for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-0686 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

d. WebAccess JSON Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability

A cross-site scripting vulnerability allows for execution of JavaScript in the Web browser's security context for WebAccess. The flaw is due to incorrect parsing of JSON error messages.
This vulnerability can only be exploited if the attacker tricks the WebAccess user into clicking a malicious link.
Workaround
By switching off WebAccess the issue can no longer be exploited. See section 3.a on how this can be accomplished.
VMware would like to thank Nathan Keltner for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-1193 to this issue.

# VMware Player, Server, Workstation: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **201209-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation, allowing remote and local attackers to conduct several
attacks, including privilege escalation, remote execution of arbitrary
code, and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.9.156507** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

VMware Player, Server, and Workstation allow emulation of a complete PC
on a PC without the usual performance overhead of most emulators.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

Local users may be able to gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, or gain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial
of Service. Remote attackers also may be able to spoof DNS traffic, read
arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server
Console.

Furthermore, guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the
host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of
Service (crash the host OS).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Player. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Player:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-player"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
â>=app-emulation/vmware-player-3.1.5â, however these packages are
not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Workstation. We recommend that
users unmerge VMware Workstation:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-workstation"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
â>=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-7.1.5â, however these packages
are not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Server. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Server:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-server"

```
