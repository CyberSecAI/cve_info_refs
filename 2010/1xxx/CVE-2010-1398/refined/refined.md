{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how WebKit inserts an element into an editable container. During this process, the library manipulates the contents of the field before the new node insertion. When traversing the tree, the application attempts to access an uninitialized element that was created before the insertion, leading to a memory corruption issue.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory access",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The user must be tricked into visiting a malicious website."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website that the victim will be coerced to visit."
