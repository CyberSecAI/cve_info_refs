  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the 'zgtips.dll' library of ZipGenius when processing specially crafted ZIP files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can overwrite the SEH (Structured Exception Handler) and potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious ZIP archive. The attacker needs to convince the victim to open this malicious ZIP file using the vulnerable software.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious ZIP file with a crafted payload designed to overflow a buffer in the `zgtips.dll` library. The attacker needs to convince a user to open this malicious file using the vulnerable version of ZipGenius. The exploit is local as the attacker needs to make the victim execute it on their machine."
