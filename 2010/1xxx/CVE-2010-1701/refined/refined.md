{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input passed via the 'cat' parameter in the 'browse.html' page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially gaining access to sensitive information, including user credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request with a crafted 'cat' parameter to the 'browse.html' page."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which is likely accessible over the web."
