Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `login.php` script of Mini-CMS RibaFS 1.0. This occurs because the script directly incorporates user-supplied input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the `login` and `senha` parameters from the POST request are directly used in the `WHERE` clause of the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: By injecting SQL code such as `' or '1=1` into the `login` field, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism, logging in without valid credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web Interface: The attack vector is the `login.php` script accessible through the web interface.
- HTTP POST Request: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `login.php` containing malicious SQL code in the `login` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Mini-CMS instance.
- Basic HTTP Request Knowledge: The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP POST request.
- No prior authentication: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability without prior access or knowledge of valid credentials.
