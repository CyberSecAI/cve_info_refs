{
  "CVE-2010-1203": {
    "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "Root cause": "Crashes in the JavaScript engine due to malformed typemap in nested trees.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption",
       "Incorrect type tagging",
      "Type mismatch in trace recorder"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
    "Attack vectors": "A user being tricked into viewing a malicious website.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious web page to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is caused by a type disparity between the FrameInfo view and SideExits captured in nested functions, that also use closures to update global variables. It was discovered that inner functions could change types in earlier frames, and this was not handled properly during the tracing process. This leads to a crash during runtime, due to incorrect type tagging. The fix involved detecting this mutation and aborting the trace."
