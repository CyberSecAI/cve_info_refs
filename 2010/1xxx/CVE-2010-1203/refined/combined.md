How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-26

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.2.4/ 1.9.1.10)

Announced
June 22, 2010
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.10
* Firefox 3.6.4
* SeaMonkey 2.0.5
* Thunderbird 3.0.5

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in
the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References

Turner, Jonathan Kew and David Humphrey reported crashes in the

<mwu> dvander: <http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Future.html> and then click on Exchanger<V> in the lower left frame (in classes)
I can reproduce this, but the trace is fairly complicated so I'm bisecting.

Andreas, the bisect pointed to [bug 536564](/show_bug.cgi?id=536564 "RESOLVED FIXED - Performance fell off a cliff on JSA* benchmark due to changes in the benchmark") which we haven't taken on mozilla-1.9.2 yet (only landed on mozilla-central on Feb 2, 2010) - is that bisect no longer thought to be the cause? Are we sure that this affects mozilla-1.9.2?

Attached patch

[test case](attachment.cgi?id=440412&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=440412&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=557946&attachment=440412)

There's an outer function with a variable |m| of type T1. This function has a loop which calls into an inner function that closes over |m|. The closure sets |m| to type T2. There is now a disparity between the FrameInfo view of |m|, which was captured at the point of the call as T1, and SideExits captured later with T2.
Normally that's fine because most trace exits are "shallow" - the exit occurs in the outermost trace, and thus the exit contains the most recent types. The problem here is that the frames are "deep". In this case, we expect that inner functions could not have changed the types in earlier frames, and thus we reconstruct the stack from the FrameInfo.
With closures that's not true. The stack's types don't match and we're tagging values wrong.
Note: The callee guard on function calls makes it slightly harder to test case this. The trigger must occur in the same activation that the tracer was recorded.
The hard fix would be changing LeaveTree to use the innermost nested exit per tree (rather than just the innermost tree). The easy fix is just detecting this mutation and aborting the trace. After talking to Andreas it seems like the easy fix is best, since this is extremely rare in the wild.

Correct, the bisect was just noise. This affects 1.9.2 and trunk (but not 1.9.1).

Using the testcase in [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=557946#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - TM: Crash with malformed typemap in nested trees or \"Assertion failure: *(JSObject**)slot == NULL, at ../jstracer.cpp\""), it asserts at Assertion failure: \*(JSObject\*\*)slot == NULL, at ../jstracer.cpp

Marking "needed" right now; we're going to do a second build for Firefox 3.6.4, and if a patch becomes available and bakes we'll take it for sure, but I'm not sure we'd hold that respin for this.
Andreas: if you think this \*must\* make it out in the next support release (probably ship mid-May) as opposed to the one following (mid-June), please let me know why.blocking1.9.2: ? → needed

Yeah, not about whether or not we'll take it (we will!) more about whether or not we hold out of process plugins (Firefox 3.6.4) until we've got a fix for this. Are you guys working on a fix now, and have a good sense of how long before it might be baked and ready to land on mozilla-1.9.2?

| [Comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=557946#c13)• 15 years ago |
|  | |

Mike: My main concern is that we are about to land a fix so we can bake this. Even with a non-obvious commit message, and even if we withhold the test case until we ship, people can probably easily tell its a security fix, since the corresponding bugzilla bug is closed and the patch goes onto branch. Its still not trivial to extract a test case from the fix, so I don't think the world is going to end if we skip 3.6.4, but I do think we would open up a window of opportunity to get zero-day-ed based on the information leak inherent in our work flow.
PS: We will try to land a fix tonight.

(In reply to [comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=557946#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - TM: Crash with malformed typemap in nested trees or \"Assertion failure: *(JSObject**)slot == NULL, at ../jstracer.cpp\""))
> since the corresponding bugzilla bug is closed
This can be mitigated by using a cover bug, fwiw - e.g. [bug 549349](/show_bug.cgi?id=549349 "RESOLVED FIXED - file drop URIs only accidentally work").

I cannot reproduce this bug on 1.9.2 pre-fix using the original link. I don't get a crash or an assert in my debug builds.

Al, it is likely we don't trace that particular site on 1.9.2 (which is why my original bisect was misleading). That is, an old bug being accidentally triggered by a new feature.

So this is just defense in depth in case there is a way to expose this on 1.9.2?

The attached test case will definitely crash on 1.9.2.

You're right. Doh.
It crashes the 1.9.2 debug build I made at the build 1 time and it fails to crash the build I built this morning (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100422 Namoroka/3.6.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.2) - XUL + XPCOM application runner

## Details

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.0)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.0/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)
  -
  [1.9.2.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2/1.9.2.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [abrowser](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)
  -
  [1.9.2.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2/1.9.2.6%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

Mozilla has changed the support model for Firefox and they no longer

support version 3.0 of the browser. As a result, Ubuntu is providing an

upgrade to Firefox 3.6 for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS users, which is the most current

stable release of Firefox supported by Mozilla. When upgrading, users

should be aware of the following:

* Firefox 3.6 does not support version 5 of the Sun Java plugin. Please use

  icedtea-java7-plugin or sun-java6-plugin instead.
* After upgrading to Firefox 3.6.6, users may be prompted to upgrade 3rd

  party Add-Ons. In some cases, an Add-On will not be compatible with

  Firefox 3.6.6 and have no update available. In these cases, Firefox will

  notify the user that it is disabling the Add-On.
* Upgrades to Ubuntu 8.10 from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS may break the browser.

  Ubuntu 8.10 is no longer officially supported and users are required to

  upgrade to 9.04 to receive active security support and a functional browser.
* Font configuration cannot be controlled via Gnome settings. This is a

  known issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/559149> and will

  be fixed in a later update.
* helix-player is not currently supported in Firefox 3.6. This is a known

  issue and may be fixed in a future update.
* RealAudio via the totem plugin is no longer supported in Firefox 3.6 in

  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Affected users navigating to Real content will be

  prompted to install optional community supported packages.
* In Ubuntu 8.04 LTS the xine plugin is non-functional. After upgrading to

  Firefox 3.6, the plugin may cause the browser to crash, while in Firefox

  3.0 it would be silently ignored. Users are advised to uninstall

  xine-plugin and/or gxineplugin.
* Plugins using external helpers (such as Totem) may not close when using

  the Epiphany browser. This is a known issue being tracked in

  <https://launchpad.net/bugs/599796> and will be fixed in a later update.

  This issue only affects Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

Assertion failure: isNumber(\*p) == (t == TT\_DOUBLE), at ../jstracer.cpp:3337
This assert came about from jsfunfuzz but I don't have a reproducible testcase. Filing in case someone can figure out the cause. This occurred in 32-bit js debug shell on TM changeset 7c63a6c5ca78 on 10.6.2.

Apparently, no. It occurred once and never did occur again thus far. I don't have a core dump either.

This happens reliably for me in Thunderbird gloda unit tests on x86\_64 just-checked-out mozilla central rev 46484930f4f3, debug build:
Assertion failure: isNumber(\*p) == (t == TT\_DOUBLE), at comm-central/mozilla/js/src/jstracer.cpp:3559
I just pulled the tracemonkey branch and still see it, rev 15df4512f52f:
Assertion failure: isNumber(\*p) == (t == TT\_DOUBLE), at /home/visbrero/rev\_control/hg/comm-central/mozilla/js/src/jstracer.cpp:3337
For example, in a comm-central build with a mozilla-central mozilla/ dir, in objdir/mailnews/db/gloda/test invoking the following will do it:
make SOLO\_FILE=test\_query\_messages\_imap\_online.js check-one
It has actually been like this for several weeks or maybe even a few months. I never bothered saying anything before because I assumed it would be a short-lived problem and Thunderbird is currently targeting mozilla-1.9.2 anyways, but I just tried again and saw it was still happening...
The unit test and exercised code in question are nowhere near trivial enough for me to attempt to try and reduce them without knowing what the trace is of. Having said that, please let me know what I can do to help!

I think in cases like this where the testcase is difficult to reduce/obtain, having a core dump \*might\* be useful. gal, dvander, would it help if asuth is able to send you a dump?

I'm not sure what the general policy is for getting a core dump out of an xpcshell test dying on an assertion. I used check-interactive with gdb attached and then used gdb's generate-core-file. You can find it here:
<http://clicky.visophyte.org/scratch/tracemonkey-tt-double-core-1.bz2>
If there's a better way to get a more useful core, please let me know.
It's 244 megs when un-bzipped, 25 bzipped.
I'm on fedora12 x86\_64. I believe the same problem also occurred on Ubuntu 9.04 x86\_64.

Here, |attrID| (and |values|) were not declared with |let| or |var|, so they are binding as globals.
This exposed a corner case in the trace recorder where the interpreter could change global types behind its back. Now it will simply abort the trace.Assignee: general → dvanderStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

fix
Good start, but this isn't enough because we can also get here from other places.
Suppose we record a call to a JSNative. At record time, it's well behaved, but at run time, it calls JS\_SetProperty to modify the global object. This goes through JSObject::setProperty to js\_SetProperty to js\_SetPropertyHelper. At some point we need to deep-bail.
The fix in setElem is good, but a jsapi-test and a fix are needed for the more general case.

I think the problem was described backwards: It's well-defined at run-time, the set will cause the trace to abort (as Brendan said, LeaveTraceIfGlobalObject).
The problem is when these paths are taken at record time. It's okay if the global shape changes because we'll throw out the trace. But if a single type changes, the assert will botch.

I pushed the fix for gloda not having used a 'let' where it should have to comm-central:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/06c2c95bdcc6>
This obviously does not have any impact on the underlying bug, but it seemed worth noting here.

beltzner, we kinda screwed up here a little. A dup of this bug with a test case was open for quite a while. We didn't realize that it was a dup until a few minutes ago. This is a pretty bad bug, likely exploitable, but maybe a notch less bad than a GC rooting bug. The patch is a trivial 1-liner that stops us from tracing this particular case. The only relevant downside risk is a performance regression. However, we never emitted correct code for this in the first place. I recommend the next dot release, but the ship might have sailed. Sorry. Not our week ...blocking1.9.1: --- → ?blocking1.9.2: --- → ?blocking2.0: --- → ?

Correction: This might stop code from tracing that traced before and accidentally worked. So there is a chance for perf regressions. global[] is unlikely to be a frequent use case, but still.

Not I! The code in question that triggered the bug is no longer so present in Thunderbird and I do not believe ever was triggered on mozilla-1.9.2 because of differing policies on what chrome gets traced. The analysis/unit test seems pretty compelling to me, though :)

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.5.10, fixing various bugs
and security issues.
MFSA 2010-33 / CVE-2008-5913:
Security researcher Amit Klein reported that it was possible to reverse
engineer the value used to seed Math.random(). Since the pseudo-random
number generator was only seeded once per browsing session, this seed
value could be used as a unique token to identify and track users
across different web sites.
MFSA 2010-32 / CVE-2010-1197:
Security researcher Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive reported that
the Content-Disposition: attachment HTTP header was ignored when
Content-Type: multipart was also present. This issue could potentially
lead to XSS problems in sites that allow users to upload arbitrary
files and specify a Content-Type but rely on Content-Disposition:
attachment to prevent the content from being displayed inline.
MFSA 2010-31 / CVE-2010-1125:
Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that focus()
could be used to change a user's cursor focus while they are
typing, potentially directing their keyboard input to an unintended
location. This behavior was also present across origins when content
from one domain was embedded within another via an IFRAME. A malicious
web page could use this behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim
while they were typing sensitive information such as a password.
MFSA 2010-30 / CVE-2010-1199:
Security researcher Martin Barbella reported via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative that an XSLT node sorting routine contained an integer
overflow vulnerability. In cases where one of the nodes to be sorted
contained a very large text value, the integer used to allocate a
memory buffer to store its value would overflow, resulting in too small
a buffer being created. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
write data past the end of the buffer, causing the browser to crash
and potentially running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-29 / CVE-2010-1196:
Security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity reported that the routine
for setting the text value for certain types of DOM nodes contained an
integer overflow vulnerability. When a very long string was passed to
this routine, the integer value used in creating a new memory buffer
to hold the string would overflow, resulting in too small a buffer
being allocated. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write
data past the end of the buffer, causing a crash and potentially
running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-28 / CVE-2010-1198:
Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that two plugin instances
could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a reference to an
object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold that reference
after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is destroyed. In
these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer to freed memory
which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-27 / CVE-2010-0183:
Security researcher wushi of team509 reported that the frame
construction process for certain types of menus could result in a menu
containing a pointer to a previously freed menu item. During the cycle
collection process, this freed item could be accessed, resulting in the
execution of a section of code potentially controlled by an attacker.
MFSA 2010-26 / CVE-2010-1200 / CVE-2010-1201 / CVE-2010-1202 / CVE-2010-1203:
Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2010-25 / CVE-2010-1121:
A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity during the 2010 Pwn2Own
contest sponsored by TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. By moving
DOM nodes between documents Nils found a case where the moved node
incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could
be triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this
freed object. The contest winning exploit only affects Firefox 3.6
and not earlier versions. Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5,
SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the
browser engine were patched just in case there is an alternate way
of triggering the underlying flaw.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Details

USN-930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox and Xulrunner. This update

provides updated packages for use with Firefox 3.6 and Xulrunner 1.9.2 on

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

firefox security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2010-0500)

Original Release Date: June 25, 2010

Last Revised: July 7, 2011

Number: ASA-2010-165

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1121](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1121.html), [CVE-2010-1200](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1200.html), [CVE-2010-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1202.html) and [CVE-2010-1203](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1203.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for
a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1198](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1198.html) to this issue.

Several integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed
web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1196](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1196.html) and [CVE-2010-1199](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1199.html) to these issues.

A focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A
malicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,
such as usernames and passwords. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1125](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1125.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the "Content-Disposition:
attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
also present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the
"Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent content from being
displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content
to users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1197](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1197.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could
be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different
websites. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-5913](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2008-5913.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.
Certain security checks were not being called when an XML document was
loaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load
certain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its
add-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML
document. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-0182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0182.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0500.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using RHEL4 with the affected version of firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 2.0 including 2.0 SP1 and 2.0 SP2 | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 5.2.2 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
