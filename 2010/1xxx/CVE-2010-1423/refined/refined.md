{
  "CVE-2010-1423": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The Sun Java Deployment Toolkit plugin and ActiveX control perform insufficient argument validation, allowing an attacker to perform several attacks, including the execution of an arbitrary JAR file.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `launch()` method in the Java Deployment Toolkit plugin and ActiveX control does not properly validate the URL passed to it, allowing arbitrary arguments to be passed to the `javaws.exe` executable.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient argument validation in the `launch()` method.",
        "The ability to pass the `-J` option to `javaws.exe`."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document. The code within the JAR file will execute with elevated Java privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted HTML documents",
          "Exploiting the `launch()` method to pass malicious arguments to `javaws.exe`"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML document and convince a user to visit it. The attacker must also host a malicious JAR file for the targeted user to download and execute. They need no prior access to the target machine other than a working network connection."
    },
    "additional_information": {
         "solution": "Apply the update to Java 1.6.0_20, which includes new versions of the Java Deployment Toolkit ActiveX control and plug-in, and sets the kill bit for the vulnerable ActiveX control. If the update does not correctly update all instances of the Java Deployment Toolkit plugin in the new_plugin directory, manually delete the vulnerable npdeploytk.dll and replace it with the updated npdeployJava1.dll from the bin directory. Disable the Java Deployment Toolkit ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit using provided registry entry. Alternatively, disable all ActiveX controls in the internet zone. For Mozilla Firefox, use ACLs to prevent access to npdeploytk.dll. Disable Java Deployment Toolkit Plugin in Firefox."
