How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Java Deployment Toolkit insufficient argument validation

#### Vulnerability Note VU#886582

Original Release Date: 2010-04-12 | Last Revised: 2010-04-19

---

### Overview

The Sun Java Deployment Toolkit plugin and ActiveX control perform insufficient argument validation, allowing an attacker to perform several attacks, including the execution of an arbitrary JAR file.

### Description

| The Sun Java Deployment Toolkit contains an NPAPI (Netscape compatible) plugin and an ActiveX control which are installed in the end user's browser(s). The toolkit contains a launch() method which can be used to pass a Java Networking Launching Protocol (JNLP) URL to the registered handler for JNPL files. On Windows systems, the default handler is the Java Web Start utility, javaws.exe.  As detailed [here](http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-April/074036.html), because the launch() method performs insufficient argument validation of the URL, arbitrary arguments can be passed to javaws.exe. This includes the '-J' option, which can allow an attacker to execute a remote JAR file. The code in the JAR file will execute with elevated Java privileges, which is equivalent to the execution of arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted HTML document, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Java 1.6.0\_20. Please see the [release notes](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/6u20.html) for more details. This update provides new versions of the Java Deployment Toolkit ActiveX control and plug-in. The update also sets the kill bit for the vulnerable version of the ActiveX control.**Note:** The installer for Java 1.6.0\_20 may not correctly update all instances of the Java Deployment Toolkit plugin. In some cases, the plugin that resides in the \bin\ew\_plugin directory may not be updated to the fixed 6.0.200.2 version of npdeployJava1.dll. If the new\_plugin directory contains npdeploytk.dll version 6.0.190.4 or earlier, then browsers that use plug-ins, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, may still be vulnerable. To correct this situation, delete the vulnerable npdeploytk.dll from the new\_plugin directory and replace it with the npdeployJava1.dll version from the bin directory. |
| --- |

| Please note that the Java Development Toolkit can be installed in multiple browsers, therefore workarounds need to be applied to all browsers with the Java Development Toolkit.  **Internet Explorer****Disable the Java Deployment Toolkit ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:{CAFEEFAC-DEC7-0000-0000-ABCDEFFEDCBA}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{CAFEEFAC-DEC7-0000-0000-ABCDEFFEDCBA}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. **Mozilla Firefox****Prevent access to npdeploytk.dll**Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to prevent access to npdeploytk.dll. Please note that based the plugin.scan.SunJRE setting, Firefox will not only scan the Firefox 'plugin' directory for plugins, it will search additional directories based on the user's installation of Java. Ensure that ACLs apply to all instances of npdeploytk.dll within Firefox's search path. Please refer to [this mozillazine article](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Plugin_scanning) for more information.**Disable Java Deployment Toolkit Plugin**In Mozilla Firefox, select Tools-> Add-ons, click the Plugins icon, then select 'Java Deployment Toolkit', then 'Disable'. Please note that if Java is updated or reinstalled, the plugin may be reenabled. |
