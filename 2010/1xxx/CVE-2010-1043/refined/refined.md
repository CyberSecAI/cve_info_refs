Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1043
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `$_GET['p']` parameter in the `index.php` file of JaxCMS. The application directly includes a file based on user input without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, it uses  `include '/pages/'.$_GET['p'].'.php'`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. By manipulating the `p` parameter, an attacker can force the application to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to. This can include sensitive configuration files, database credentials, or even source code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a crafted GET request to the `index.php` file, providing a path to a file via the `p` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable JaxCMS instance.
    *   **Basic Understanding of LFI:**  The attacker needs to understand how to use LFI vulnerabilities and the concept of null byte termination `%00` to bypass file extensions.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is in `index.php`, which takes user-controlled input from the `$_GET['p']` parameter and includes it directly in a file path. By appending `'.php'` to the provided input, the application tries to include the given path as a php file. An attacker can bypass this by using a null byte `%00` to truncate the path before the `.php` extension is added, leading to arbitrary file inclusion.

**Exploit:**
The exploit URL would be of the form:
`http://server/[JaxCMS PATH]/index.php?p=[LFI]%00`
Where `[LFI]` is the path to the file to be included and read.
