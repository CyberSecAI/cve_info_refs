The provided content is a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party TYPO3 extensions. This advisory is directly related to the CVE description which states "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval". Since there is no specific CVE assigned here, the advisory is treated as a placeholder which describes a series of vulnerabilities as specified in the content.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** This is the most common vulnerability, affecting extensions such as:
    *   Brainstorming
    *   Educator
    *   Diocese of Portsmouth Database
    *   SAV Filter Alphabetic
    *   SAV Filter Selectors
    *   SAV Filter Months
	*   Book Reviews
	*   Simple Gallery
	*   TGM-Newsletter
	*   YATSE
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** A variation of SQL injection, affecting:
    *   MK Wastebasket
    *   CleanDB
	*   CleanDB - DBAL
	*   Meet Travelmates
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Affecting:
    *  Sellector.com Widget Integration
    *  myDashboard
	*   Reports Logfile View
	*   Simple Gallery
    *   Typo3 Quixplorer
	*   UserTask Center, recent
	*   TGM-Newsletter
	*   YATSE
*   **Information Disclosure:** Affecting:
    *   Power Extension Manager
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Affecting:
    *   TYPO3 Security - Salted user password hashes

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   The root causes vary by extension but generally stem from:
    *   **Improper Input Sanitization:** Failure to sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Lack of Output Encoding:** Failure to properly encode output data, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** Inadequate checks for user authentication or authorization, enabling unauthorized access and authentication bypass.
    *   **Lack of Security Measures:** Some extensions seem to lack basic security measures when handling user data or interacting with databases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection/Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials.
    *   Manipulation or deletion of data.
    *   Potential for complete compromise of the database and the application server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser.
    *   Session hijacking and account compromise.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of websites.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive information, which could be leveraged for further attacks.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the application.
    *   Ability to perform actions on behalf of another user or administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities by injecting malicious SQL code via user inputs, such as form fields or URL parameters.
*   **XSS:** Attackers inject malicious scripts, often through user inputs that are not properly encoded, that are then executed in the browsers of other users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities to access files or data that should be restricted.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain access without valid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection/Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious input to the vulnerable web application, which can be done remotely over the network, typically via web browsers.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code through the vulnerable application, which may then be executed by the victim's browser.
*  **Information Disclosure:**
   *  The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerability through the web application.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the authentication process of the web application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory recommends removing the affected extensions where no updates are available.
*   It emphasizes the importance of following the TYPO3 Security Cookbook's recommendations.
*   The advisory also notes that collective security bulletins are used for third-party extensions with fewer downloads and importance.
*   Some extensions were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository due to unresponsiveness from their authors.
