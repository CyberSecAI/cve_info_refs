### ZDI-10-032ZDI-CAN-610

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-1185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1185) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [SAP](http://www.sap.com) |

| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9403']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of SAP MaxDB. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the serv.exe process which listens by default on TCP port 7210. The process trusts a value from a handshake packet and uses it as a length when copying data to the stack. If provided a malicious value and packet data, this can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | A solution was provided via SAP note 1409425 (<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/1409425>) |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2009-11-09 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-03-16 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
