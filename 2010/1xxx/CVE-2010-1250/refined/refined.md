Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files. Specifically, it's related to an "EDG Memory Corruption" issue during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Memory corruption vulnerability when parsing Excel files.
- Improper handling of EDG (Extended Data Graphics?) data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- Full System Control: Successful exploitation can give the attacker complete control over the affected system.
- Ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file as an attachment, and if the user opens the file, the vulnerability is exploited.
- **Web-based Attack:** The attacker hosts a malicious Excel file on a website, and if the user visits the site and opens the file, the vulnerability is exploited.
- Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content could also serve malicious Excel files

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Excel file that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file. This can be done via social engineering (e.g., convincing the user to open an email attachment or click a link).
- No special network access is required beyond getting the user to open the file.
