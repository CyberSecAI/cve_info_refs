The provided content is a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities in third-party TYPO3 extensions, and it is directly relevant to CVE-2010-1005 as this CVE is listed as the identifier for this advisory on typo3.org.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is vulnerabilities in third-party TYPO3 extensions. These vulnerabilities include SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Information Disclosure, and Authentication bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Several extensions were vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple extensions had XSS vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** One extension had an information disclosure vulnerability that could expose sensitive data.
*  **Authentication Bypass:** One extension had an authentication bypass vulnerability allowing attackers to bypass login authentication.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** A variant of SQL injection where the attacker cannot see the output of the query but can infer information based on the server's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or even take control of the database.
*  **Blind SQL Injection:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data by inferring data based on the time the server takes to respond to certain requests, without a direct output.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information, which could be misused.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers could potentially bypass login and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors vary depending on the vulnerability:

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerable input fields or parameters in the application that are used to construct SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into user-controlled data that is displayed to other users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive information through insecure interfaces or through vulnerable data handling
*  **Authentication Bypass:** Exploiting weaknesses in the authentication mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers would need to have some knowledge of web application vulnerabilities and the TYPO3 system.
*   For SQL injection and XSS, attackers would generally need to interact with the vulnerable application through a web browser.
*   For authentication bypass the attacker would need to interact with the login form of the vulnerable extension.
*   The attacker would need to target specific extensions that are installed on a TYPO3 instance.

**Vulnerable Extensions:**

The advisory lists the following vulnerable third-party extensions:

*   Brainstorming (brainstorming)
*   Power Extension Manager (ch\_lightem)
*   Sellector.com Widget Integration (chsellector)
*   Educator (educator)
*   MK Wastebasket (mk\_wastebasket)
*   myDashboard (mydashboard)
*   CleanDB (nf\_cleandb)
*   Diocese of Portsmouth Database (pd\_diocesedatabase)
*   Reports Logfile View (reports\_logview)
*   SAV Filter Alphabetic (sav\_filter\_abc)
*   SAV Filter Selectors (sav\_filter\_selectors)
*   SAV Filter Months (sav\_filter\_months)
*   Book Reviews (sk\_bookreview)
*   Simple Gallery (sk\_simplegallery)
*   Typo3 Quixplorer (t3quixplorer)
*   TYPO3 Security - Salted user password hashes (t3sec\_saltedpw)
*  UserTask Center, recent (taskcenter\_recent)
*   TGM-Newsletter (tgm\_newsletter)
*   CleanDB - DBAL (tmsw\_cleandb)
*   Meet Travelmates (travelmate)
*   YATSE - Yet another TYPO3 search engine (yatse)

**Mitigation:**

The advisory recommends the following mitigations:

*   **Update Extensions:** For some extensions, updates were available that fixed the vulnerability. Users are advised to update to the latest versions.
*   **Uninstall Extensions:** For some extensions, no updates were available, or the authors were unreachable. Users are advised to uninstall these extensions and remove all associated files from the TYPO3 installation.
*   **Follow Security Best Practices:** The advisory links to the TYPO3 Security Cookbook for general security advice.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This is a "Collective Security Bulletin" (CSB), meaning it groups multiple vulnerabilities in less critical extensions into a single advisory.
*   The advisory emphasizes that these vulnerabilities are in third-party extensions and not the core TYPO3 system.
*   The advisory details the specific versions of each extension affected, vulnerability type and severity level.
