Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1199:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the XSLT node sorting routine within Mozilla Firefox.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   A memory buffer is allocated based on the size of the text value in a node being sorted.
*   An integer used to calculate the size of this buffer can overflow when processing a very large text value.
*   This leads to the creation of a buffer that is too small for the data it is meant to store.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause the browser to crash.
*  **Memory Corruption**: Due to the integer overflow vulnerability, a memory buffer is created of an incorrect size, which leads to memory corruption when the buffer is accessed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:**  Users can be tricked into visiting a malicious webpage or rendering a malicous XML file.
*   **Malicious File:** Users can be tricked into opening a malicious file.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when an XSLT transformation is applied to an XML document with a large number of nodes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need local access.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The victim needs to open or view a malicious page or file.
*   **Control over XML Document or XSLT transformation** An attacker must have control over the XML Document or the XSLT transformation to insert the malicious content.

**Additional Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability is located in `content/xslt/src/xslt/txNodeSorter.cpp`
*   The integer overflow occurs in the following line:
    `void* mem = PR_Malloc(len * (sizeof(PRUint32) + mNKeys * sizeof(TxObject*)));`
*   The attacker controls the value of *len* and can therefore cause *len* * (sizeof(PRUint32) + mNKeys * sizeof(TxObject*)) to wrap around to a small value.
*   The overflowed buffer is later used in a copy operation
*   The vulnerability has been fixed by performing overflow checking before allocating memory with PR_Malloc.
   

**Affected Products**

*   Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
*   Firefox 3.5.10
*   SeaMonkey 2.0.5
*   Thunderbird 3.0.5

**Mitigation**
*   Update the affected software to the patched version.
*   Ensure that web browsers have proper security configurations.

**CVE-2010-1199**

Based on the provided text, the following is extracted regarding CVE-2010-1199:

*   **Vulnerability:** Integer Overflow in XSLT node sorting routine
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Mozilla Firefox 3.6.3 (and other 3.6.x versions)
    *   Firefox 3.5.10
    *   SeaMonkey 2.0.5
    *   Thunderbird 3.0.5
*   **Details:**
    *   The vulnerability lies in how Firefox allocates a buffer for storing the text value of nodes being sorted using XSLT transformations.
    *   If a node has a very large text value, the integer calculation of the buffer size overflows, resulting in too small a buffer.
    *   An attacker can then write beyond the boundaries of the undersized buffer.
    *   This buffer overflow can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Specific Code:**
    * The problematic allocation line is `void* mem = PR_Malloc(len * (sizeof(PRUint32) + mNKeys * sizeof(TxObject*)));`
    * The code loops through each node in a set being sorted and copies the data to the previously allocated undersized buffer.
*  **Attack Vector**: The attacker controls the size of data and how many elements will be sorted in XSLT. This control allows them to force integer overflow and cause a buffer overflow.
*   **Fix:** Patches are available that address this vulnerability.
*   **Exploit DB:** Exploit exists for this vulnerability, EDB-ID 14949.
