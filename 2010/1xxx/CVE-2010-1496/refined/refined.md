Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `com_joltcard` Joomla component.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `cardID` parameter in the `view` task is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract database information. The exploit mentions that "Selected information gets only displayed within the HTML source code (look at `<OBJECT>` tag)," implying that the injection is used to reveal data rather than to directly alter the database.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Joomla component, specifically targeting the `cardID` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Joomla instance. No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided text, suggesting the vulnerability is exploitable remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.

The provided information includes a specific example of how to exploit this vulnerability using a crafted URL:
`index.php?option=com_joltcard&Itemid=XX&task=view&cardID=X+AND+1=2+UNION+SELECT+concat(database())--`

This detailed exploit information is more specific than the generic CVE description placeholder, providing valuable context on the attack method.
