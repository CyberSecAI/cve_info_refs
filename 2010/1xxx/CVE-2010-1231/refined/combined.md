Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2010/03/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, March 17, 2010

**EDIT 23-Mar-10 (mal)**: Remove "[[33572](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33572)] Medium HTTP headers processed before SafeBrowsing check" from security issues fixed. This is not fixed in this release.
The stable channel has been updated to 4.1.249.1036 for Windows, and includes the following features and security fixes (since 4.0):

* Translate infobar.
* Privacy features: content settings (cookies, images, JavaScript, plug-ins, pop-ups).
* Disabling experimental new anti-reflected-XSS feature called "XSS Auditor". The feature is still experimental, and we're disabling it while we look into some serious performance issues in rare cases. Please see [this post](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/01/security-in-depth-new-security-features.html) for more details about what the XSS Auditor is.

 Please see [this feature announcment post](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/03/polyglot-google-chrome-beta-with-new.html) for more info about translate and privacy.

 Security Fixes and rewards:
 Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.
