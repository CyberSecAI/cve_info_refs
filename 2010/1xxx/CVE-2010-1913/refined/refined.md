  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2010-1913",
      "root_cause": "The Consona (formerly SupportSoft) Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS) contains multiple vulnerabilities across different components.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `ns6plugindestructor.asp`.",
        "Unsafe methods provided by the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`).",
        "Buffer overflow in the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`).",
         "Local privilege elevation vulnerability in the Repair Service (`tgsrv.exe`) present only on Windows Vista and Windows 7."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user, and possibly gain SYSTEM privileges via the Repair Service. The XSS vulnerability can be used to instantiate the vulnerable ActiveX control, which can then be used to download and execute arbitrary programs. The Repair Service vulnerability can be used to elevate privileges from a standard user to SYSTEM.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email message), an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability to instantiate the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
        "Exploiting unsafe methods provided by the ActiveX control to download and execute arbitrary programs.",
         "Exploiting the Repair Service to elevate from user (or Low-Rights IE) privileges to SYSTEM."
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with malicious HTML content. The attacker can chain multiple vulnerabilities, such as XSS and unsafe ActiveX methods, for code execution. For privilege escalation they need to target Windows Vista/7 and exploit the Repair service."
