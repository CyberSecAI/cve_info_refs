Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1066:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a database backup functionality in the AWCM (version 2.1) application. The `db_backup.php` script directly exposes the database for download.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Direct Database Exposure:** The `db_backup.php` script allows direct downloading of the database without proper authentication or authorization checks. This is a severe security flaw, as it makes the entire database accessible to anyone who knows the path.
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The application does not implement any access control mechanisms for the database backup functionality. This allows any unauthenticated user to trigger the database download.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Disclosure:** The attacker can download the entire database, which may contain sensitive information such as user credentials, application data, configuration details, and more.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The exposure of sensitive data can be leveraged to further compromise the system and/or other systems that interact with the compromised application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Web Request:** The attacker directly requests the vulnerable file, `site/path/control/db_backup.php`, through a web browser or using command-line tools like curl.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the exact path to the vulnerable script (`db_backup.php`).

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to AWCM version 2.1.
- The exploit is straightforward and requires minimal technical expertise.

This vulnerability is a serious issue, due to the easy access to the entire database.
