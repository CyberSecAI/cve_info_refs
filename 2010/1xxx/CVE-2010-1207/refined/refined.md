Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2010-1207:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of same-origin checks on canvas elements. Specifically, the "write-only" flag, intended to prevent reading data from a canvas after cross-origin content has been rendered, was associated with the canvas element itself, not the canvas's rendering context. The context could outlive the canvas element, leading to a bypass of the same-origin policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect placement of the origin-clean flag on the canvas element, not the rendering context.
- Lack of a strong reference between the context and the canvas element, allowing the context to persist even after the canvas element was garbage collected.
- Failure to properly enforce same-origin policy when the canvas element is no longer available, yet its rendering context still exists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious website could read pixel data from a canvas element that has rendered cross-origin content. This would allow bypassing the same-origin policy and expose sensitive information from another domain.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can load cross-origin content into a canvas element.
- Retain a reference to the canvas's rendering context.
- Delete the associated canvas node from the DOM.
- Call `getImageData()` on the orphaned rendering context to extract cross-origin pixel data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control content on a web page.
- Ability to use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements and canvas rendering contexts.
- Ability to load cross-origin content through methods like `drawImage`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in bug 502715, where the canvas 2D context was enabled to function without an actual canvas element.
- The fix involved establishing a cycle collection (CC) relationship between the DOM element and the canvas context, ensuring that the context cannot outlive the canvas element while preventing cross-origin data extraction.
- The fix was applied to both 2D canvas context and WebGL context.
- Patches were created for both the main development branch and the 1.9.2 release branch.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox and Thunderbird.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 3.6.7 and Thunderbird 3.1.1.
