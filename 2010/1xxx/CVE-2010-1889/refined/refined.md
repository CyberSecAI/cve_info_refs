Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-1889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel's improper initialization of objects while handling certain errors. Specifically, the kernel fails to properly manage memory during error conditions which can lead to a double free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double Free Vulnerability:** The core issue is a double free vulnerability. This occurs when the same block of memory is freed twice. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. This effectively elevates their privileges to the highest level on the system.
- **Complete System Control:** With kernel-level access, an attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts with full administrative rights. This means they can gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system. The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerable code in the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- The attacker must be able to log on to the system locally.
- The attacker needs the ability to run a specially crafted application.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is classified as "Important" for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.
- Microsoft was not aware of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild at the time the security bulletin was released.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the Windows kernel correctly initializes objects while handling certain errors.
- The vulnerability was reported by Tavis Ormandy of Google Inc.
