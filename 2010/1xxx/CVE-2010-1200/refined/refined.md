*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Use-after-free where plugins interact by passing references to objects owned by another plugin.
    *   Lack of proper object lifetime management when plugins interact.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution if the first plugin accesses the freed memory.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious web content that exploits plugin interactions to create a dangling pointer.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to create a page that can execute multiple plugin instances.

**CVE-2010-1196 & CVE-2010-1199**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow vulnerabilities when setting text values for certain DOM nodes and during XSLT node sorting. These are similar to CVE-2010-1202 & CVE-2010-1203, but more specific in context.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    * Integer overflows when allocating memory buffers for node text and during node sorting.
    * Buffer overflow when writing the value, due to the incorrect memory allocation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of service (crashes).
    *   Potential arbitrary code execution via buffer overflow.

**Additional Vulnerabilities**

*   There are mentions of a crash that occurs in `nsViewManager::CreateView` and `nsCSSFrameConstructor::AddFrameConstructionItemsInternal`, related to print preview with `-moz-transform` and `position: fixed` table displays, which was resolved but not directly assigned a CVE.
*   Additionally, there is a mention of possible vulnerability in `nsEditingSession.cpp` concerning its use of  `InitWithFuncCallback` which could lead to use after free condition.

**General Notes:**

*   Multiple crashes were reported with the same root cause, indicating an issue that is common in how these versions of Firefox handled specific web content scenarios.
*   These issues were primarily addressed in updates for Firefox 3.5.10, Firefox 3.6.4, and later versions. Some were also backported to 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 branches.
*   Most of the reported crashes, especially those in the JavaScript and layout engine, could potentially allow arbitrary code execution.
*   Many of these bugs were also fixed by later rewrites of the impacted components for example, the fix for `multipart/x-mixed-replace` discarding issues and other memory management fixes.
*   The root cause is often inadequate handling of edge cases or memory handling flaws in the layout engine, JavaScript engine, and networking layer.

These vulnerabilities highlight the importance of browser updates.
