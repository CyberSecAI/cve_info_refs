Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in Gnat-TGP version 1.2.20 or earlier. The `DOCUMENT_ROOT` parameter in the `tgpinc.php` file is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or sanitization for the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious URL, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary remote files on the server.

*  **Impact of exploitation**: By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP script, potentially leading to full server compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `tgpinc.php` file, using the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` parameter to point to a malicious remote file.
    Example: `http://server/includes/tgpinc.php?DOCUMENT_ROOT=[Shell]`

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Gnat-TGP application and must have access to a publicly accessible server where the malicious file is hosted.
