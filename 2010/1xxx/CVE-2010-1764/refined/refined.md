Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a design flaw in WebKit's handling of HTTP redirects. Specifically, when a form submission is redirected to a website that also performs a redirection, the form data may be sent to the third site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure due to improper handling of HTTP redirects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information contained in form submissions could be disclosed to a third-party website, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse of the data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious website can trick a user into submitting a form which is then redirected to another site and then to a final malicious destination, exfiltrating the data in the process.
- This attack requires the user to interact with the malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and host a malicious website that can initiate the redirection chain after a user submits a form.

**Additional Details (from Apple advisory):**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a form submission is redirected to a website that also does a redirection.
- The information contained in the submitted form may be sent to the third site.
- Apple addressed this issue by improving the handling of HTTP redirects.

**Affected Products (from different sources):**
- iOS 2.0 through 4.0.2 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 4.0.2 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later
- Safari for Mac OS X and Windows
- openSUSE 11.2-11.3, SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1

The vulnerability is not a memory corruption issue, but rather a design flaw related to how form data is handled during redirects. This vulnerability is present in multiple versions of WebKit and was addressed with improved redirect handling.
