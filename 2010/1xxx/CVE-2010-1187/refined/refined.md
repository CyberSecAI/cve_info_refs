{
  "cve": "CVE-2010-1187",
  "description": "The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel, when the tipc module is inserted, enters a standalone node mode where communication to its own address (<0.0.0>) is allowed but not to other addresses. User programs can cause a NULL pointer dereference by sending datagrams via AF_TIPC before entering network mode, because the appropriate data structures have not been allocated yet. This allows a local user to crash the kernel.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because the tipc_net pointer, which is required for sending messages to remote addresses, is not initialized when the module enters standalone mode. Attempting to dereference this pointer leads to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper initialization of data structures"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can crash the kernel, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "A local user can send datagrams via AF_TIPC before entering networked mode, triggering the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the system to send datagrams via AF_TIPC socket. Normal user privileges are sufficient."
  },
  "fix": "The fix converts global pointers to static arrays to avoid dereferencing uninitialized pointers and eliminates the setup/teardown routines for these pointers."
