  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the 'path_om' and 'dsn[phptype]' parameters.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local or remote files, potentially leading to code execution, data leakage, or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'path_om' parameter in the URLs of several PHP files, an attacker can include remote files. By manipulating the 'dsn[phptype]' parameter in the 'soustab.php' script, an attacker can include local files using null byte injection.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker can be located remotely."
