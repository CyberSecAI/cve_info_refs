{
  "CVE-2010-1323": {
    "root_cause": "The MIT krb5 implementation incorrectly accepts unkeyed checksums in the SAM-2 preauthentication challenge and when verifying KRB-SAFE messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Acceptance of unkeyed checksums",
      "Use of low-entropy derived keys with RC4"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker could alter a SAM-2 challenge, potentially affecting the user prompt or the response sent to the KDC. In some cases, this can negate the security benefit of single-use authentication tokens. Additionally, an attacker has a 1/256 chance of forging KRB-SAFE messages if an RC4 session key is used.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack",
       "Man-in-the-middle attack to intercept SAM-2 challenge",
       "Forging KRB-SAFE messages in an existing application protocol session using RC4"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic, especially SAM-2 challenges.  If forging KRB-SAFE messages, an active session using RC4 session key."
