How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SUMMARY
=======
These vulnerabilities are in the MIT implementation of Kerberos
(krb5), but because these vulnerabilities arise from flaws in protocol
handling logic, other implementations may also be vulnerable.
CVE-2010-1324
MIT krb5 (releases krb-1.7 and newer) incorrectly accepts an unkeyed
checksum with DES session keys for version 2 (RFC 4121) of the GSS-API
krb5 mechanism.
MIT krb5 (releases krb5-1.7 and newer) incorrectly accepts an unkeyed
checksum for PAC signatures. Running exclusively krb5-1.8 or newer
KDCs blocks the attack.
MIT krb5 KDC (releases krb5-1.7 and newer) incorrectly accepts RFC
3961 key-derivation checksums using RC4 keys when verifying the
req-checksum in a KrbFastArmoredReq.
CVE-2010-1323
MIT krb5 clients (releases krb5-1.3 and newer) incorrectly accept an
unkeyed checksums in the SAM-2 preauthentication challenge.
MIT krb5 (releases krb5-1.3 and newer) incorrectly accepts RFC 3961
key-derivation checksums using RC4 keys when verifying KRB-SAFE
messages.
CVE-2010-4020
MIT krb5 (releases krb5-1.8 and newer) incorrectly accepts RFC 3961
key-derivation checksums using RC4 keys when verifying AD-SIGNEDPATH
and AD-KDC-ISSUED authorization data.
CVE-2010-4021
MIT krb5 KDC (release krb5-1.7 only) may issue tickets not requested
by a client, based on an attacker-chosen KrbFastArmoredReq.
IMPACT
======
CVE-2010-1324
An unauthenticated remote attacker can forge GSS tokens that are
intended to be integrity-protected but unencrypted, if the targeted
pre-existing application session uses a DES session key.
An authenticated remote attacker can forge PACs if using a KDC that
does not filter client-provided PAC data. This can result in
privilege escalation against a service that relies on PAC contents to
make authorization decisions.
An unauthenticated remote attacker has a 1/256 chance of swapping a
client-issued KrbFastReq into a different KDC-REQ, if the armor key is
RC4. The consequences are believed to be minor.
CVE-2010-1323
An unauthenticated remote attacker could alter a SAM-2 challenge,
affecting the prompt text seen by the user or the kind of response
sent to the KDC. Under some circumstances, this can negate the
incremental security benefit of using a single-use authentication
mechanism token.
An unauthenticated remote attacker has a 1/256 chance of forging
KRB-SAFE messages in an application protocol if the targeted
pre-existing session uses an RC4 session key. Few application
protocols use KRB-SAFE messages.
CVE-2010-4020
An authenticated remote attacker that controls a legitimate service
principal has a 1/256 chance of forging the AD-SIGNEDPATH signature if
the TGT key is RC4, allowing it to use self-generated "evidence"
tickets for S4U2Proxy, instead of tickets obtained from the user or
with S4U2Self. Configurations using RC4 for the TGT key are believed
to be rare.
An authenticated remote attacker has a 1/256 chance of forging
AD-KDC-ISSUED signatures on authdata elements in tickets having an RC4
service key, resulting in privilege escalation against a service that
relies on these signatures. There are no known uses of the KDC-ISSUED
authdata container at this time.
CVE-2010-4021
An authenticated remote attacker that controls a legitimate service
principal could obtain a valid service ticket to itself containing
valid KDC-generated authorization data for a client whose TGS-REQ it
has intercepted. The attacker could then use this ticket for
S4U2Proxy to impersonate the targeted client even if the client never
authenticated to the subverted service. The vulnerable configuration
is believed to be rare.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
CVE-2010-1324
Kerberos application client and server software (including third-party
applications) using GSS-API libraries from MIT releases krb5-1.7 and
newer are vulnerable to the DES GSS-API issue if they use GSS-API for
integrity protection of unencrypted messages.
Kerberos application server software (including third-party
applications) using libraries from MIT releases krb5-1.7 and newer are
vulnerable to the PAC issue.
Deployments running exclusively KDCs from releases krb5-1.8 and newer
are not vulnerable to the PAC issue because those KDCs discard
client-provided PAC authdata.
The MIT krb5 KDC in releases krb5-1.7 and newer is vulnerable to the
KrbFastReq swapping issue.
CVE-2010-1323
Initial credential acquisition clients (including kinit) in MIT
releases krb5-1.3 and newer are vulnerable to the SAM-2 issue.
Third-party applications that obtain initial Kerberos credentials
using libraries from these releases are also vulnerable.
Kerberos application client and server software (including third-party
applications) using libraries from MIT releases krb5 krb5-1.3 and
newer are vulnerable to the RC4 KRB-SAFE issue.
CVE-2010-4020
The AD-SIGNEDPATH issue affects the KDC in releases krb5-1.8 and
newer.
Kerberos application server software (including third-party
applications) using libraries from MIT releases krb5-1.8 and newer are
vulnerable to the AD-KDC-ISSUED problem. Deployments running
exclusively KDCs from releases krb5-1.8 and newer discard
client-provided AD-KDC-ISSUED authdata and are not vulnerable to this
issue.
CVE-2010-4021
The KDC from release krb5-1.7 only is vulnerable to the KrbFastReq
forgery issue.

DETAILS
=======
Background for RC4-keyed RFC 3961 checksum issues:
The hmac-sha1-des3, hmac-sha1-96-aes128, and hmac-sha1-96-aes256
checksum types are specified to be used with 3DES, AES128, and AES256
keys respectively, but MIT krb5 allows these checksum types to be used
with any type of key. All three checksum types make use of a key
derivation algorithm built around the block encryption operation of
the key's encryption type.
The arcfour-hmac and arcfour-hmac-exp encryption types are specified
in RFC 4757, and make use of a stream cipher instead of a block
cipher. The MIT krb5 implementation treats these encryption types as
having a cipher block size of one byte for the purposes of key
derivation. When the aforementioned checksum types perform key
derivation, they repeatedly invoke stream cipher encryption on
one-byte blocks. The result is a derived key whose contents alternate
between a known byte (which depends only on the key usage value) and a
byte whose values depend on the key. There are only 256 possible
derived keys for each key usage value.
CVE-2010-1324 (GSS-API issue):
RFC 4121 specifies version 2 of the krb5 GSS-API mechanism. It is
commonly used only with "newer" encryption types, but may be used with
any encryption type. RFC 4121 specifies that non-confidential Wrap
messages and Message Integrity Codes (MICs) are computed using the
required checksum type for the key's encryption type. MIT krb5 uses
the internal krb5int\_c\_mandatory\_cksumtype function to look up this
checksum type. This function returns incorrect values for DES
encryption types, selecting unkeyed rather than keyed checksums.
If a GSS-API context is established using a DES key, the MIT krb5 code
will accept Wrap or MIC tokens in either the RFC 4121 or RFC 1964
style. An attacker can construct a Wrap or MIC token in the RFC 4121
style using unkeyed checksums.
CVE-2010-1324 (PAC issue):
Privilege Attribute Certificates (PACs) are a type of authorization
data specified in:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc237917(PROT.13).aspx
PACs contain two signature fields which bind the PAC to the server and
krbtgt keys; this signature is intended to prove that the PAC was
generated by the KDC and not by a client. PAC signatures are
specified to use the hmac-md5, hmac-sha1-96-aes128, or
hmac-sha1-96-aes256 keyed checksum types. The MIT krb5 code for
verifying PAC signatures does not verify that the checksum type
contained in the PAC is a keyed signature, so a client could use an
unkeyed checksum to "prove" that its made-up PAC data was generated by
a KDC. This attack would not work in the presence of a sufficiently
recent (1.8 or later) MIT KDC because the KDC would filter out
client-provided PAC authdata.
CVE-2010-1324 (KrbFastReq swapping issue):
The KDC may accept an RFC 3961 key-derivation checksum keyed with an
RC4 key in the req-checksum field of KrbArmoredFastReq. An attacker
has a 1/256 chance of guessing the derived key that would be required
to bind a captured encrypted KrbFastReq to a different KDC-REQ
message. This is probably at worst an auditing issue; the KDC will
log a successful authentication, but with the wrong parameters, and
the client will not necessarily be able to use the resulting ticket.
CVE-2010-1323 (SAM-2 issue):
CVSSv2 Base Score: 5.4
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: High
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: Complete
Availability Impact: None
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 4.2
Exploitability: Proof-of-Concept
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
SAM-2 is a preauthentication mechanism described in:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-sam-03 (SAM2)
In this mechanism, a KDC sends a challenge to the client consisting of
a challenge body and a list of checksums. The client prompts the user
for Single-use Authentication Data (SAD), computes a reply key based
on the SAD and the parameters in the challenge body, and then tries to
verify each of the checksums against the body using the reply key. If
no checksum matches, the client assumes that the SAD value is
incorrect or the integrity of the challenge has been tampered with by
a party with no knowledge of the reply key. The MIT krb5 code for
verifying SAM-2 challenge signatures does not verify that the checksum
type is keyed, so an attacker alter a challenge and supply an unkeyed
signature, fooling the client into believing that the challenge body
was not tampered with. The general result would be that the client
would transmit an invalid reply to the KDC, causing preauthentication
to fail.
With non-challenge/response SAM tokens having low entropy (e.g., a
clock-based token with six decimal digits of readout), this may allow
an attacker to learn the SAD value by a precomputation attack,
negating the incremental security benefit of using a SAM token. This
would allow the attacker to authenticate to the KDC as the user, or to
impersonate the KDC to the user, provided that the user's password has
been previously captured.
CVE-2010-1323 (KRB-SAFE RC4 issue):
The KRB-SAFE message is intended for the integrity protection of
cleartext application data. An attacker can forge KRB-SAFE messages
in an existing application protocol session with 1/256 probability of
success, if the session uses an RC4 session key.
CVE-2010-4020 (authdata RC4 issue):
CVSSv2 Base Score: 3.5
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Medium
Authentication: Single
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: Partial
Availability Impact: None
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 2.7
Exploitability: Proof-of-Concept
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
S4U2proxy is a Microsoft protocol extension that allows a service to
impersonate a user to another service, in a constrained way:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246071(PROT.13).aspx
MIT and Heimdal implementations of Kerberos use an extension to take
the place of the Windows PAC in S4U2proxy evidence tickets:
http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/ConstrainedDelegation
The signature in the SIGNEDPATH authorization data uses the TGT key,
which is only known to the KDC. If the TGT key is RC4, then a service
can forge this signature with a 1/256 chance of success by supplying
an inappropriate checksum type.
CVE-2010-4021 (KrbFastReq forgery issue):
CVSSv2 Base Score: 2.1
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: High

Integrity Impact: Partial
Availability Impact: None
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 1.6
Exploitability: Proof-of-Concept
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
In release krb5-1.7, but not newer releases, the KDC allows an
arbitrary TGT credential to serve as the armor for TGS requests,
allowing the inner request to be arbitrarily altered by an attacker
who controls a service principal. (The attacker has full knowledge of
the armor key, having provided the armor ticket.) The resulting
ticket is useless to both client and attacker unless the named service
principal in the forged request is that of the attacker.
By intercepting a legitimate TGS-REQ message, a malicious service that
has S4U2Proxy privileges can rewrite the inner request so that the
service named in the request is itself, and then capture the issued
ticket for use as an evidence ticket in a S4U2Proxy request to
impersonate the client to another service, even though the client
never asked for a ticket for the malicious service. Since krb5-1.7
does not natively support S4U2proxy, the attack is only feasible in
certain cross-realm configurations, which are believed to be rare,
involving Active Directory domains that grant S4U2proxy privileges to
services in a non-AD Kerberos foreign realm.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml documents could crash applications linked
against libxml2 (CVE-2010-4008).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- tomboy
The tomboy startup scripts put empty elements in LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
causing tomboy to load shared libraries from the current directory
(CVE-2010-4005).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- krb5
krb5 did no properly check messages. Remote attackers could exploit
that to modify or forge messages
(CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-4020, CVE-2010-4021)
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- php5
Insufficient handling of certain character sequences in the
utf8\_decode() function could be leveraged to conduct
cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2010-3870).
php5 could also consume large amounts of memory and crash if a long
mail address was passed to filter\_var() with parmeter
FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL (CVE-2010-3710).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- cups
- CVE-2010-3702: Specially crafted PDF files could crash pdftops or
potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code.
- CVE-2010-2941: Specially crafted IPP requests could crash cupsd
- CVE-2010-0542: A NULL pointer dereference in the \_WriteProlog()
function of the texttops image filter.
- CVE-2010-1748: An attacker with access to the web-interface may be
able to read some bytes of uninitialized memory.

- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Untrusted applets could read values of restricted system properties
(CVE-2010-3860).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- epiphany
Epiphany does not support verification of ssl certificates. It
nevertheless displayed all https connections as secure
(CVE-2010-3312).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2
- encfs
- CVE-2010-3073: encfs only used 32bits for the IV

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

provided that the advisory is not modified in any way. In particular, the
clear text signature should show proof of the authenticity of the text.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

# USN-1030-1: Kerberos vulnerabilities

9 December 2010

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [krb5](/security/cves?package=krb5) -

## Details

It was discovered that Kerberos did not properly determine the

acceptability of certain checksums. A remote attacker could use certain

checksums to alter the prompt message, modify a response to a Key

Distribution Center (KDC) or forge a KRB-SAFE message. ([CVE-2010-1323](/security/CVE-2010-1323))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not properly determine the

acceptability of certain checksums. A remote attacker could use certain

checksums to forge GSS tokens or gain privileges. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04 LTS and 10.10. ([CVE-2010-1324](/security/CVE-2010-1324))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not reject RC4 key-derivation

checksums. An authenticated remote user could use this issue to forge

AD-SIGNEDPATH or AD-KDC-ISSUED signatures and possibly gain privileges.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and 10.10. ([CVE-2010-4020](/security/CVE-2010-4020))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not properly restrict the use of TGT

credentials for armoring TGS requests. A remote authenticated user could

use this flaw to impersonate a client. This issue only affected Ubuntu

9.10. ([CVE-2010-4021](/security/CVE-2010-4021))

##### 1. Summary

VMware ESXi and ESX could encounter a socket exhaustion situation which may lead to a denial of service. Updates to Likewise components and to the ESX Service Console address security vulnerabilities.﻿

#####

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware ESXi 4.1 without patch ESXi410-201104401-SG.
VMware ESXi 4.0 without patch ESXi400-201104401-SG.

VMware ESX 4.1 without patch ESX410-201104401-SG.
VMware ESX 4.0 without patch ESX400-201104401-SG.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. ESX/ESXi Socket Exhaustion
By sending malicious network traffic to an ESXi or ESX host an attacker could exhaust the available sockets which would prevent further connections to the host. In the event a host becomes inaccessible its virtual machines will continue to run and have network connectivity but a reboot of the ESXi or ESX host may be required in order to be able to connect to the host again.
ESXi and ESX hosts may intermittently lose connectivity caused by applications that do not correctly close sockets. If this occurs an error message similar to the following may be written to the vpxa log:
socket() returns -1 (Cannot allocate memory)
An error message similar to the following may be written to the vmkernel logs:
socreate(type=2, proto=17) failed with error 55
VMware would like to thank Jimmy Scott at inet-solutions.be for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2011-1785 to this issue.
Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

#####

b. Likewise package update
Updates to the vmware-esx-likewise-openldap and vmware-esx-likewise-krb5 packages address several security issues.
One of the vulnerabilities is specific to Likewise while the other vulnerabilities are present in the MIT version of krb5. An incorrect assert() call in Likewise may lead to a termination of the Likewise-open lsassd service if a username with an illegal byte sequence is entered for user authentication when logging in to the Active Directory domain of the ESXi/ESX host. This would lead to a denial of service. The MIT-krb5 vulnerabilities are detailed in MITKRB5-SA-2010-007.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2011-1786 (Likewise-only issue), CVE-2010-1324, CVE-2010-1323, CVE-2010-4020, CVE-2010-4021 to these issues.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2129-1                  security@debian.org

Package        : krb5
Vulnerability  : checksum verification weakness
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-1323

A vulnerability has been found in krb5, the MIT implementation of
Kerberos.

MIT krb5 clients incorrectly accept an unkeyed checksums in the SAM-2
preauthentication challenge: An unauthenticated remote attacker could
alter a SAM-2 challenge, affecting the prompt text seen by the user or
the kind of response sent to the KDC. Under some circumstances, this
can negate the incremental security benefit of using a single-use
authentication mechanism token.

MIT krb5 incorrectly accepts RFC 3961 key-derivation checksums using
RC4 keys when verifying KRB-SAFE messages: An unauthenticated remote
attacker has a 1/256 chance of forging KRB-SAFE messages in an
application protocol if the targeted pre-existing session uses an RC4
session key. Few application protocols use KRB-SAFE messages.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned
CVE-2010-1323 to these issues.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny6.

The builds for the mips architecture are not included in this advisory.
They will be released as soon as they are available.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problem have been fixed in version 1.8.3+dfsg-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
