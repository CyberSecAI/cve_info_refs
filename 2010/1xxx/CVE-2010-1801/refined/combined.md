#### Security Update 2010-005

* **ATS**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1808

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A stack buffer overlow exists in Apple Type Services' handling of embedded fonts. Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1800

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: CFNetwork permits anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue does not affect the Mail application. This issue is addressed by disabling anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6.3. Credit to Aaron Sigel of vtty.com, Jean-Luc Giraud of Citrix, Tomas Bjurman of Sirius IT, and Wan-Teh Chang of Google, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **ClamAV**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0098, CVE-2010-1311

  Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues by updating ClamAV to version 0.96.1. ClamAV is distributed only with Mac OS X Server systems. Further information is available via the ClamAV website at <http://www.clamav.net/>

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1801

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files. Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking. Credit to Rodrigo Rubira Branco from the Check Point Vulnerability Discovery Team (VDT) for reporting this issue.

* **libsecurity**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1802

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position who can obtain a domain name that differs only in the last characters from the name of a legitimate domain may impersonate hosts in that domain

  Description: An issue exists in the handling of certificate host names. For host names containing three or more components, the last characters are not properly compared. In the case of a name containing exactly three components, only the last character is not checked. For example, if an attacker in a privileged network position could obtain a certificate for www.example.con the attacker can impersonate www.example.com. This issue is addressed through improved handling of certificate host names. Credit to Peter Speck for reporting this issue.

* **PHP**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1205

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Loading a maliciously crafted PNG image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in PHP's libpng library. Loading a maliciously crafted PNG image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed by updating libpng within PHP to version 1.4.3. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6.

* **PHP**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1129, CVE-2010-0397, CVE-2010-2225, CVE-2010-2484

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in PHP 5.3.1

  Description: PHP is updated to version 5.3.2 to address multiple vulnerabilities, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. Further information is available via the PHP website at <http://www.php.net/>

* **Samba**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-2063

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An unauthenticated remote attacker may cause a denial of service or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in Samba. An unauthenticated remote attacker may cause a denial of service or arbitrary code execution by sending a maliciously crafted packet. This issue is addressed by performing additional validation of packets in Samba.
