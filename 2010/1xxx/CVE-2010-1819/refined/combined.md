## QuickTime 7.6.8

* **QuickTime**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1818

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An input validation issue exists in the QuickTime ActiveX control. An optional parameter '\_Marshaled\_pUnk' may be passed to the ActiveX control to specify an arbitrary integer that is later treated as a pointer. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed by ignoring the '\_Marshaled\_pUnk' parameter. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to HBelite working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue.

* **QuickTime**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1819

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

  Impact: Viewing an image in a maliciously prepared directory may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A path searching issue exists in QuickTime Picture Viewer. If an attacker places a maliciously crafted DLL in the same directory as an image file, opening the image file with QuickTime Picture Viewer may lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed by removing the current working directory from the DLL search path. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems.
