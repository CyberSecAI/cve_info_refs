- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A path searching issue exists in QuickTime Picture Viewer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: QuickTime Picture Viewer does not properly restrict the DLL search path, leading to DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker places a maliciously crafted DLL in the same directory as an image file. When a user opens the image file with QuickTime Picture Viewer, the malicious DLL is loaded and executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to write files to a directory that a user will browse to using QuickTime Picture Viewer.
