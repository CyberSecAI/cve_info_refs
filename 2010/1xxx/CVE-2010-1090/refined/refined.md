Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-1090:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` and `contact.php` files of phpMySite.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The `action` GET parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `contact.php` file is vulnerable to XSS through the POST parameters: `name`, `city`, `email`, `state`, and `message`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data. This could lead to data breaches, loss of integrity, or complete compromise of the database.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page. When other users interact with this page, the injected script could execute in their browsers. This can result in session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the website.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is the `action` GET parameter in the `index.php` file.
    *   **XSS:** The attack vector is through the POST parameters: `name`, `city`, `email`, `state`, and `message` in `contact.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET/POST requests to the vulnerable `phpMySite` web application.
    *   No specific privileges or user interaction beyond sending HTTP requests are required. The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.

**Summary of Exploits:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The provided proof-of-concept (POC) shows how to inject SQL code using the `action` parameter in `index.php`.
    ```
    index.php?action=${SQLINJECTIONHERE}&key=111-222-1933email@address.tst
    ```
*   **XSS:** The POC shows how to inject malicious script using the POST parameters within `contact.php`.
    ```
    name=Crux&city=1>">&state=NY&email=sample%40email%2Etst&message=111-222-1933email@address.tst&word=111-222-1933email@address.tst
    ```
