    "summary": "The Linux kernel versions 2.6.18 through 2.6.33, and possibly other versions, are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack due to memory corruption. This is triggered by creating a large number of Bluetooth sockets (L2CAP, SCO, and RFCOMM), which leads to uncontrolled writes to arbitrary pages of memory because of insufficient size checks on sysfs files related to Bluetooth sockets. Attackers can exploit this remotely.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper size validation for sysfs files related to Bluetooth sockets when a high number of sockets are created.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption due to uncontrolled writes to arbitrary memory locations",
        "Insufficient size checks on sysfs files."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by corrupting memory, potentially leading to system crashes or other unstable behavior.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attack via Bluetooth connections"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a large number of Bluetooth sockets, which can be done remotely. No specific user privileges are required beyond the ability to connect via Bluetooth."
