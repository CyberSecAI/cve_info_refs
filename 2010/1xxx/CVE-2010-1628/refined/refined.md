Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-1628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of infinitely recursive procedure invocations within the Ghostscript interpreter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Recursion:** The interpreter fails to detect and handle infinite recursion, leading to a stack overflow.
- **Stack Overflow:**  The recursive calls consume stack space, eventually overflowing it.
- **Uncontrolled Jump:**  Upon stack overflow, execution jumps to an attacker-controlled address, rather than gracefully terminating.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by controlling the jump address after the stack overflow. This is possible by manipulating the PostScript file to include shellcode.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even without exploiting arbitrary code execution, a stack overflow leads to a crash of the application, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PostScript Files:** The primary attack vector is by enticing a user to open a maliciously crafted PostScript file.
- **File Processing by Ghostscript:** Any application or system that uses Ghostscript to process untrusted PostScript files is vulnerable. This includes CUPS which can be used for privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create Malicious PostScript File:** The attacker must be able to craft a PostScript file containing a recursive procedure invocation, like `/A{pop 0 A 0} bind def /product A 0`.
- **Ability to Entice a User:** The attacker must entice a user or an automated system into opening the malicious PostScript file using a vulnerable Ghostscript installation.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is present in "all tested versions" of Ghostscript.
* The issue was identified and reported by Dan Rosenberg.
* The fix involves ensuring all memory allocations are successful before initializing data structures related to procedure calls.
* This vulnerability is distinct from another Ghostscript vulnerability CVE-2010-1869 which relates to stack overflow due to large identifiers.
* The vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation if Ghostscript is used by printing systems like CUPS
