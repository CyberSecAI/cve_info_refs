- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `com_onlineexam` component in Joomla! version 1.5.0 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `controller` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application directly includes files based on user-supplied input without proper checks, allowing attackers to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or application source code. This can lead to further attacks, such as privilege escalation, information disclosure, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `controller` parameter in the URL when accessing the `com_onlineexam` component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application. No special privileges are needed.
