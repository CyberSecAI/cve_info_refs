```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `merge_authdata` function in `kdc_authdata.c` does not correctly handle the filtering of KDC-issued authorization data items, resulting in an uninitialized pointer being introduced into the authorization data list.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An uninitialized pointer is introduced into the authorization data list. This can lead to a crash due to the dereferencing of this pointer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the KDC. In rare cases, it's theoretically possible that an attacker could cause unauthorized information disclosure, ticket modification, or even arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted TGS requests to the KDC.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated remote user.",
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is present in MIT krb5 versions 1.8 through 1.8.3, and it is triggered by a flaw in how authorization data is handled. Windows Active Directory clients can consistently produce TGS requests that trigger this vulnerability."
