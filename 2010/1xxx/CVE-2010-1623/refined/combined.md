Here are the details from the Slackware 13.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/apr-1.3.12-i486-1_slack13.1.txz:  Upgraded. patches/packages/apr-util-1.3.10-i486-1_slack13.1.txz:  Upgraded.   Fixes a memory leak and DoS in apr_brigade_split_line().   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1623   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com? Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading directly from ftp.slackware.com.  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Notes

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

will be fixed in apache2 2.2.17.
apache2 has an embedded code copy of apr-util. Dapper uses
the embedded version, hardy+ uses the system apr-util.
apache2 2.2.15+ also use the code in mod\_reqtimeout
lucid mod\_reqtimeout backport already contains this fix

It was discovered that Apache's mod\_cache and mod\_dav modules incorrectly

handled requests that lacked a path. A remote attacker could exploit this

with a crafted request and cause a denial of service. This issue affected

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1452](/security/CVE-2010-1452))

It was discovered that Apache did not properly handle memory when

destroying APR buckets. A remote attacker could exploit this with crafted

requests and cause a denial of service via memory exhaustion. This issue

affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 10.10. ([CVE-2010-1623](/security/CVE-2010-1623))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=640281#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-10-05 13:00:46 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-1623](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1623) to the following vulnerability:  The apr_brigade_split_line function in buckets/apr_brigade.c in the Apache Portable Runtime Utility library (aka APR-util) before 1.3.10, as used in the mod_reqtimeout module in the Apache HTTP Server and other software, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via unspecified vectors.

This issue affects the versions of the apr-util package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  --  This issue affects the versions of the apr-util package, as shipped with Fedora release of 12 and 13.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=640281#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2010-11-26 17:36:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=640281#c0)) > The apr_brigade_split_line function in buckets/apr_brigade.c in the > Apache Portable Runtime Utility library (aka APR-util) before 1.3.10, > as used in the mod_reqtimeout module in the Apache HTTP Server  The "as used in" part of the description is not correct.  The confusion is probably caused by upstream using [CVE-2010-1623](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1623) CVE id in commits fixing apr_brigade_split_line() issue in apr-util as well as similar flaw in the mod_reqtimeout module.  mod_reqtimeout was not using apr_brigade_split_line().  mod_reqtimeout module was introduced in httpd version 2.2.15: <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.2.x/CHANGES?revision=917876&view=markup#l26>  Vulnerable code was never part of released 2.2.x version, the issue only affected development versions: <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1005957>  that corrects previous commit: <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1005669>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=640281#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-12-08 00:25:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2010:0950 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0950.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=640281#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-22 23:17:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0  Via RHSA-2011:0896 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0896.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=640281#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-22 23:39:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 4   JBEWS 1 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2011:0897 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0897.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
