The provided content is a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities in various third-party TYPO3 extensions, which is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerabilities:**

The advisory lists multiple vulnerabilities affecting different TYPO3 extensions. These vulnerabilities include:

*   **SQL Injection:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   Affected Extensions: Brainstorming, Educator, Diocese of Portsmouth Database, SAV Filter Alphabetic, SAV Filter Selectors, SAV Filter Months, Book Reviews, Simple Gallery, TGM-Newsletter, YATSE.
    *   Some SQL injection vulnerabilities were specifically noted as "Blind SQL Injection" in the MK Wastebasket, CleanDB, and CleanDB - DBAL, and Meet Travelmates extensions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   Affected Extensions: Sellector.com Widget Integration, myDashboard, Reports Logfile View, Simple Gallery, Typo3 Quixplorer, UserTask Center, recent, TGM-Newsletter, YATSE.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive information that should not be publicly available.
    *   Affected Extensions: Power Extension Manager.
*    **Authentication Bypass:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass normal authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the system.
     *  Affected Extensions: TYPO3 Security - Salted user password hashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:

*   **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Website Defacement:** Injection of malicious code leading to changes in website appearance or content.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers might gain full control of the system through SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Unauthorised access**: Attackers may be able to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are primarily through:

*   **Web interface:** Malicious input through web forms or URLs that are processed by the vulnerable extensions, particularly via SQL injection and XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to identify and exploit vulnerable extensions installed on the TYPO3 CMS instance.
*   For SQL injection, the attacker would need the ability to send malicious SQL code to the affected system.
*   For XSS attacks, the attacker needs to inject malicious scripts via the extensions that are then run in the browsers of other users.
*   For authentication bypass, the attacker would need to leverage the vulnerability in the salted password hashes extension.

**Mitigation:**

The advisory recommends the following mitigation steps:

*   **Update Extensions:** For extensions with available updates, users are advised to update to the fixed versions as soon as possible.
*   **Uninstall Vulnerable Extensions:** For extensions where updates are not available or the authors have not provided a fix, users are advised to uninstall and delete the extensions from their TYPO3 installation.
*   **Security Cookbook:** Follow the recommendations given in the TYPO3 Security Cookbook.
*   **Mailing List:** Subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list to receive future security bulletins.
