{
  "CVE-2010-1157": {
    "Root cause": "The `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header for BASIC and DIGEST authentication includes a realm name. If a `<realm-name>` element is not specified in web.xml, Tomcat will generate a realm name that may reveal the server's local hostname or IP address.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of the server's local host name or IP address in the `WWW-Authenticate` header.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can cause the vulnerable server to expose its hostname/IP address via HTTP response headers when BASIC or DIGEST authentication is used."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the server that will result in a `401` response containing the vulnerable header."
  }
