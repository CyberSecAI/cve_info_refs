# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.34

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### important: ap\_find\_token() Buffer Overread ([CVE-2017-7668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7668))

The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap\_find\_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap\_find\_token() to return an incorrect value.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Dominic Scheirlinck and Scott Geary of Vend for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.31

### low: HTTP request smuggling attack against chunked request parser ([CVE-2015-3183](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3183))

An HTTP request smuggling attack was possible due to a bug in parsing of chunked requests. A malicious client could force the server to misinterpret the request length, allowing cache poisoning or credential hijacking if an intermediary proxy is in use.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

## Details

It was discovered that Apache's mod\_cache and mod\_dav modules incorrectly

handled requests that lacked a path. A remote attacker could exploit this

with a crafted request and cause a denial of service. This issue affected

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1452](/security/CVE-2010-1452))

It was discovered that Apache did not properly handle memory when

destroying APR buckets. A remote attacker could exploit this with crafted

requests and cause a denial of service via memory exhaustion. This issue

affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 10.10. ([CVE-2010-1623](/security/CVE-2010-1623))

Here are the details from the Slackware 13.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/httpd-2.2.16-i486-1_slack13.1.txz:  Upgraded.   Fix Handling of requests without a path segment.

              Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.16 Released

The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
pleased to announce the release and immediate availability of version
2.2.16 of the Apache HTTP Server ("httpd").  This version of httpd is
principally a security and bug fix release.

Notably, this release addresses CVE-2010-1452 (cve.mitre.org), a remote
denial of service bug in mod_cache and mod_dav. This release further
addresses the issue CVE-2010-2068 within mod_proxy_ajp, mod_proxy_http,
mod_reqtimeout.

We consider this release to be the best version of httpd available, and
encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

Apache HTTP Server 2.2.16 is available for download from:

 <http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>

Please see the CHANGES_2.2 file, linked from the download page, for a
full list of changes.  A condensed list, CHANGES_2.2.16 provides the
complete list of changes since 2.2.15. A summary of security
vulnerabilities which were addressed in the previous 2.2.15 and earlier
releases is available:

 <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html>

Apache HTTP Server 2.2.16 is compatible with Apache Portable Runtime
(APR) versions 1.3 and 1.4, APR-util library version 1.3, and
APR-iconv library version 1.2.  The most current releases should
be used to address known security and platform bugs.  At the time of
this httpd release, the recommended APR releases are:

 * Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library version 1.4.2 (bundled),
   or at minimum, version 1.3.12
 * ARR-util library version 1.3.9 (bundled)
 * APR-iconv library version 1.2.1 (bundled only with win32-src.zip)

Older releases of these libraries have known vulnerabilities or other
defects affecting httpd.  For further information and downloads, visit:

 <http://apr.apache.org/>

Apache HTTP Server 2.2 offers numerous enhancements, bug fixes, and
performance enhancements over the 2.0 codebase.  For an overview of
new features introduced since 2.0 please see:

 <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/new_features_2_2.html>

This release builds upon and extends the httpd 2.0 API.  Modules written
for httpd 2.0 will need to be recompiled in order to run with httpd 2.2,
and may require minimal source code changes.

When upgrading or installing this version of httpd, please bear in mind
that if you intend to use httpd with one of the threaded MPMs (other
than the Prefork MPM), you must ensure that any modules you will be
using (and the libraries they depend on) are thread-safe.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Apache 2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2011:1216-1
Rating: important
References: #555098 #627030 #661597 #663359 #690734 #713966
Cross-References: CVE-2011-3192
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has 5 fixes is
now available.
Description:
This update fixes a remote denial of service bug (memory
exhaustion) in the Apache 2 HTTP server, that could be
triggered by remote attackers using multiple overlapping
Request Ranges . (CVE-2011-3192)
The fix introduces a new config option: Allow MaxRanges
Number of ranges requested, if exceeded, the complete
content is served. default: 200 0|unlimited: unlimited
none: Range headers are ignored. (This option is a backport
from 2.2.21.)
It fixes also the minor security issue in the mod\_cache
modules in the Apache HTTP Server that allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via
a request that lacks a path. (CVE-2010-1452)
It also fixes some non-security bugs: - take
LimitRequestFieldsize config option into account when
parsing headers from backend. Thereby avoid that the
receiving buffers are too small. bnc#690734. - add / when
on a directory to feed correctly linked listings.
bnc#661597 - a2enmod shalt not disable a module in query
mode. bnc#663359 - New option SSLRenegBufferSize fixes
"413 Request Entity Too Large occur" problem. - fixes
graceful restart hangs, bnc#555098.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has three
fixes is now available.
Description:
This update fixes a remote denial of service bug (memory
exhaustion) in the Apache 2 HTTP server, that could be
triggered by remote attackers using multiple overlapping
Request Ranges. (CVE-2011-3192)
It also fixes a issue in mod\_dav, where the (1) mod\_cache
and (2) mod\_dav modules in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x
allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(process crash) via a request that lacks a path.
(CVE-2010-1452)
Also following bugs were fixed:
\* recommend the default MPM (prefork) via Recommends:
in .spec
\* apache not sending error 304 if mod\_deflate is
enabled.
\* take LimitRequestFieldsize config option into account
when parsing headers from backend.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
