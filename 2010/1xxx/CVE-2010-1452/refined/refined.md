    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod_cache (2.2) and mod_dav (2.0 and 2.2). Specifically, the modules incorrectly handled requests lacking a path.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of requests without a path segment in mod_cache and mod_dav."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This would lead to a denial of service if using the worker MPM.",
      "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP request lacking a path segment.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.",
        "additional_information": "The issue is further mitigated as mod_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod_cache is only affected if the uncommon 'CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers' directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used. The crash occurs due to a segmentation fault while generating a cache key."
