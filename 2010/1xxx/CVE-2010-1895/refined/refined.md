Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-1895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper memory allocation within Windows kernel-mode drivers when copying data from user mode. Specifically, the drivers fail to properly allocate memory before copying user-mode data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Pool Overflow:** The inadequate memory allocation leads to a pool overflow vulnerability. This occurs when the kernel-mode drivers write data beyond the boundaries of the allocated memory buffer, potentially corrupting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode. This provides the attacker with complete control over the affected system.
- **Full System Compromise:** With kernel-level access, the attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** The attack requires the attacker to have valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the affected system. Remote or anonymous exploitation is not possible.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must run a specifically crafted application that triggers the memory allocation vulnerability within the kernel-mode drivers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user with valid logon credentials.
- The attacker must have the ability to execute programs on the targeted system.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `win32k.sys` driver, which is a core component of the Windows kernel responsible for window management, graphics, and user input.
- The vulnerability occurs when the driver copies data from user mode to kernel mode.
- The patch addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Windows kernel-mode drivers allocate memory.

The provided content offers more detail than the basic CVE description by specifying the affected driver (win32k.sys), detailing the memory allocation issue, and clearly stating the attacker's required position (local access).
