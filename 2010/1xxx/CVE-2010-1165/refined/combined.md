# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Hello,

As you probably know, Apache.org services were taken down due to the XSS and
privilege escalation flaws in JIRA. Atlassian patched the issues, and released
an advisory.

Bug entires:

XSS Vulnerability: <http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-20994>
Privilege escalation: <http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-20995>

JIRA Advisory:

Could anyone assign CVE IDs for these issues?

Thanks,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several security vulnerabilities have been exposed on JIRA. Please refer to [this document](/jira/security-addendum-2010-04-16-determining-if-your-public-jira-instance-has-been-compromised-216433274.html) **before proceeding** to determine if your system has been compromised.

**In this advisory:**

## Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities

#### Severity

Atlassian rates these vulnerabilities as **critical**, according to the scale published in Severity Levels for Security Issues. The scale allows us to rank a vulnerability as critical, high, moderate or low.

#### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed several privilege escalation vulnerabilities, which may affect JIRA instances. These vulnerabilities have security implications and are especially important for anyone running publicly accessible instances of JIRA.

An attacker, who has gained administrator access to a JIRA instance, could set the attachment, index or backup paths to a location within the JIRA web application directory. Once this has been done, the attacker can upload malicious code that can execute in the context of the user running the application server in which JIRA is deployed. The attacker could potentially modify JIRA's files and capture user credentials. If you have followed standard guidelines for hardening your application servers, then your instance should be less susceptible to this vulnerability.

![(info)](/s/-tb799o/9012/oiycav/_/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) The JIRA web application directory is either the `atlassian-jira` subdirectory (for JIRA Standalone installations) or the `webapps` subdirectory for JIRA WAR installations on Tomcat. For other application servers, please consult that application server's relevant documentation for discovering the web application directory.

#### Risk Mitigation

We strongly recommend either upgrading or patching your JIRA installation to fix these vulnerabilities. Please see the 'Fix' section [below](#JIRASecurityAdvisory20100416-privilegeescalationfix).

Note: If you are an Atlassian JIRA Studio or Hosted customer, we have assessed that your system is secure and implemented additional protections for it.

We also strongly recommend that you secure your JIRA instance by following [these instructions](/jira/security-addendum-2010-04-16-preventing-security-attacks-216433277.html), even if you are not in a position to apply the patches immediately.

#### Vulnerability

All versions of JIRA are affected by these privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

As a consequence of these security fixes, the following changes to JIRA's behaviour have occurred.

* JIRA now recognises a new variable called (`jira.paths.set.allowed`) in the `jira-application.properties` file that collectively enables or disables the following capabilities through the JIRA user interface:
  + Setting the [attachments directory](/jira/configuring-file-attachments-185729586.html)
  + Setting the [indexing directory](/jira/search-indexing-185729671.html)
  + Setting the backup directory for the [backup service](/jira/automating-jira-backups-185729637.html)
  + [Restoring XML data](/jira/restoring-data-185729565.html) from a JIRA XML backup
  + Setting the directory in the "Create issues from local files" service
  + Viewing the list of administrators through the "Contact Administrators" link in the footer.

    ![(info)](/s/-tb799o/9012/oiycav/_/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) On initial application of this patch, the `jira.paths.set.allowed` property will not be present in this file and all settings above will be disabled by default. We recommend that this property be absent from your `jira-application.properties` file or if it is present, set its value to `false`.

* JIRA now recognises another new variable called (`jira.paths.safe.backup.path`) in the `jira-application.properties` file which specifies a safe path for XML backup. This property only applies to the ['Backup Data to XML'](/jira/backing-up-data-185729581.html) function and not the scheduled backup service. If the property is not present, 'Backup Data to XML' will not be allowed. The file name specified in the user interface will be appended to the safe path and used to determine the destination of the backup file. Please ensure that the safe path is separate from your web application directory.

  ![(info)](/s/-tb799o/9012/oiycav/_/images/icons/emoticons/information.svg) On initial application of this patch, the `jira.paths.safe.backup.path` property will not be present in this file.

* System logs and customer data from generated support requests have been removed. The automatically generated support request sent to Atlassian will no longer include system logs and the XML backup.

#### Fix

These issues have been fixed in [JIRA 4.1.1](/jira/jira-4-1-1-release-notes-215486193.html) and later.

These fixes are also provided as a patch for JIRA 4.1 and previous versions of JIRA. See [Available Patches](#JIRASecurityAdvisory20100416-availablepatches) (below) for the complete list of available patches.

These patches are also available from JIRA issue [JRA-21004](http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-21004). These patches also address the XSS vulnerabilities described below.

In addition to patching your instance, we strongly recommend that you also review [these instructions](/jira/security-addendum-2010-04-16-preventing-security-attacks-216433277.html) on securing your JIRA instance (and any other web application).

## XSS Vulnerabilities in JIRA

#### Severity

Atlassian rates these vulnerabilities as **critical**, according to the scale published in Severity Levels for Security Issues. The scale allows us to rank a vulnerability as critical, high, moderate or low.

#### Risk Assessment

We have identified and fixed several cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in JIRA, which may affect JIRA instances. These vulnerabilities have security implications and are especially important for anyone running publicly accessible instances of JIRA.

* The attacker might take advantage of the vulnerability to steal other users' session cookies or other credentials, by sending the credentials back to the attacker's own web server.
* The attacker's text and script might be displayed to other people viewing a JIRA page. This is potentially damaging to your company's reputation.

You can read more about XSS attacks at [cgisecurity](http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/xss-faq.shtml), [CERT](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html) and other places on the web.

#### Risk Mitigation

We strongly recommend either upgrading or patching your JIRA installation to fix these vulnerabilities. Please see the 'Fix' section [below](#JIRASecurityAdvisory20100416-xssfix).

We also strongly recommend that you secure your JIRA instance by following [these instructions](/jira/security-addendum-2010-04-16-preventing-security-attacks-216433277.html), even if you are not in a position to apply the patches immediately.

#### Vulnerability

All versions of JIRA are affected by these XSS vulnerabilities.

An attacker can inject their own JavaScript into the JIRA components listed in the table below. Each of the actions is invoked when a user performs a specific function in JIRA, such as clicking a link or a button. The actions can also be invoked by simply entering the URL into the browser address bar. The rogue JavaScript will be executed when a user invokes the URL.

| JIRA page | Routes of XSS attack |

### Description

**Note**: This issue is superceded by [~~JRA-21004~~](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-21004 "XSS and Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities in JIRA"). Please install the patches on that issue, rather than this one.

For more details, see **[JIRA Security Advisory - 2010-04-16](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2010-04-16)**.

The security advisory also has details of [how to determine if your JIRA installation has been compromised](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Security%2BAddendum%2B2010-04-16%2B-%2BDetermining%2Bif%2Byour%2Bpublic%2BJIRA%2Binstance%2Bhas%2Bbeen%2Bcompromised) and another addendum on [good system administration practices to protect your public JIRA installation](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Security%2BAddendum%2B2010-04-16%2B-%2BPreventing%2Bsecurity%2Battacks). These additions are valuable even if you cannot apply the patch immediately.

*If you have already installed this patch, install [~~JRA-21004~~](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-21004 "XSS and Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities in JIRA") on top of this patch.*

We have identified and fixed a privilege escalation vulnerability, which may affect JIRA instances.

This vulnerability is only applicable when an attacker has gained administration access on the instance. An attacker, who has gained administrator access to a JIRA instance could set the attachment, index, or backup paths to a location within the JIRA web application directory. Once this has been done, the attacker can upload malicious code that can execute in the context of the user running the application server in which JIRA is deployed. The attacker could potentially modify JIRA's files and capture user credentials. If you have followed standard guidelines for hardening your application servers, then your instance should be less susceptible to this vulnerability.

**We recommend that you apply the attached patch immediately to address these vulnerabilities.**

The Instructions to apply the patch is contained within the Readme file as part of the attached zip. Please download the appropriate patch for your version of JIRA (these patches have only been tested on the point releases specified in the zip filename). If you are not on the point release that the patch is created for, it is recommended that you first upgrade to the latest point release for your version of JIRA before applying the patch.

If you are applying this patch, we also recommend you apply the patch for [~~JRA-20994~~](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-20994 "XSS Vulnerabilities in JIRA").

**Further Updates**

This vulnerability occurs if you have configured your attachment directory, index directory, or backup directory to locations on the filesystem such that the contents can be served by the JIRA's Tomcat (or any other) application server. For example, assume that you have a J2EE/Java Webpp being served from /opt/application. You will be vulnerable to this attack if you set the attachment, index or backup directories to:

* the webapp location - /opt/application
* any path within the webapp location e.g. /opt/application/attachments or /opt/application/a/b/attachments
* any path above the webapp location e.g. / or /opt

Please note that you should consider all web applications you have on the server. For example, if you have one application served from /opt/application, and another served from /usr/local/application, then the attachment, index and backup directories should not be set to any of: /, /opt, /opt/application and its descendents, /usr, /usr/local, /usr/local/application and its descendents.

This also affects standalone installations. For example, if you have installed JIRA 4.1 standalone at: C:\apps\jira. By default, the webapp location of jira is at C:\apps\jira\atlassian-jira. Attachment, Index and backup directories should not be set to C:\, C:\apps, C:\apps\jira, C:\apps\jira\atlassian-jira, or further descendents. However, C:\apps\jira\attachments is fine.

We strongly recommend that you check these directories in JIRA, and if you currently have attachment, backup or index directories which are vulnerable as described above, that you move those directories to locations which are un-related to your webapp locations. Please note that you will need to follow these instructions even if you have applied the attached patches.

### Description

We have identified and fixed vulnerabilities in JIRA which will allow an attacker to invoke XSS (Cross Site Scripting) attacks and/or obtain escalated account privileges potentially gaining access to the file system. Full details of the severity, risks and vulnerabilities can be found in the **[JIRA Security Advisory 2010-04-16](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2010-04-16)**.

This patch supercedes both [~~JRA-20994~~](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-20994 "XSS Vulnerabilities in JIRA") and [~~JRA-20995~~](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-20995 "Privilege escalation vulnerability when administrator access is compromised") with additional fixes and protection for your JIRA instance.

**We strongly recommend that all customers apply the attached patch immediately to address these vulnerabilities, even if you have already applied [~~JRA-20994~~](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-20994 "XSS Vulnerabilities in JIRA") and [~~JRA-20995~~](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-20995 "Privilege escalation vulnerability when administrator access is compromised").**
