| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Hi folks,
I originally thought this only applies to WebKit, but realized it can be tweaked to work with Firefox only after making this proof-of-concept public. Sorry for that - it's fairly low risk, but probably interesting:
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/focus-webkit/>
This PoC is probably Windows-specific. Unlike clickjacking, this permits a fairly high degree of sophistication in interacting with third-party sites.
An obvious way to mitigate the risk is to mimic the behavior of MSIE / Opera - that is:
1) Forbid or defer focus changes between onkeydown and onkeyup, so that a malicious page can't see what's being pressed, but deliver the result elsewhere,
2) When focus is grabbed by another document in an IFRAME, and then returned, we should probably not attempt to restore it to the last known editing location, but reset it instead.
Now, the more interesting part. NOTE: THIS PART OF THE BUG IS NOT PUBLIC. We also noticed that the following is possible in WebKit browsers, and to a more limited extent and with some tweaks, in MSIE:
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/focus-webkit/toplevel.html>
In essence, the same attack can be reversed, and allow cross-domain IFRAME gadgets to steal keystrokes (including password field entries) transparently.
This attack does not work on Firefox as-is, but this seems to be due to a conjunction of what I presume are two bugs; and not a conscious security decision:
1) Calling top.focus() always seem to be silently ignored, even if the current browser window is, in fact, in focus, and the call is being made from a currently in-focus IFRAME on that page. In other browsers, this simply returns focus to the top-level document. In Firefox, it does not, presumably because of an overzealous anti-annoyance filter meant to prevent pop-ups from doing setInterval('focus()',1).
2) The other way to approach this would be to call <iframedwindow>.blur(), but counterintuitively, this blurs the entire browser window (and amusingly, doing setInterval('blur()',1) from within an IFRAME makes the browser unusable). This looks like something that may eventually get fixed by accident.
I suspect there might be some other way to restore focus to the top-level doc, but I have no obvious ideas. Even if not, it is a more compelling argument to implement the aforementioned changes to focus behavior.

Need to be careful with a change like this. I believe some services
depend on changing focus between keydown and keyup if IME is involved.
Or something like that. I don't have any examples.

I believe when returning user does expect focus to be restored to the last known
editing location. What does "reset" even mean in this context?
But still, perhaps we could handle this so that if focus changes between
keydown and keyup, the focus wouldn't return to the original editing location.
Though, even that could break web apps.

The behaviors described are, as far as I can tell, already present in MSIE and Opera to some extent, so I am not very concerned about breakage (though testing would be prudent).

My current plan is to prevent focusing not-same-origin window during user initiated key events. Or make that kind of focusing asynchronous.
Need to test both approaches.

This is one option.
I don't quite understand why the first testcase is really a security bug at all.
The second one is more serious and trickier, fortunately it doesn't apply to
gecko at the moment.
Need to test this on windows (tested only Linux).

The first test case is a problem similar to clickjacking:
<http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Arbitrary_page_mashups_(UI_redressing>)
It allows UI actions to be carried out across domains in a matter that defies the usual cross-site request forgery defenses (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSRF>). The provided example is obviously harmless, and since Google Search is not XSRF-protected, it could be achieved by just doing <iframe src="<http://www.google.com/search?q=porn>"></iframe>; but consider an XSRF-protected page on Facebook that changes your privacy settings, or adds someone as your friend, or deletes your account.

The patch should fix the first test case, and yet it doesn't break
tabbing through iframes.

First I had it other way around, but then thinking for example the case
when focus is atm in chrome, it should be able to focus whatever it wants.
Or am I thinking wrong here.
Excluding the chrome case, if the pages aren't from same domain, subsumes
should be false either way.

When focus is in chrome, the page should not be able to grab the focus. Although it can shift the currently focused element within the page, it shouldn't be able to shift the current window. That's already the case, see [bug 125282](/show_bug.cgi?id=125282 "RESOLVED FIXED - Webpage-JS can steal focus from URLbar / chrome") for that. Maybe the two code blocks could be combined as well.

In the first testcase it is the currently focused window which tries to
focus iframe. That is what I'm trying to prevent.

I think I need to see the testcase again before I can understand what the issue is here. Is the security issue only relevant when the new frame is from a different source, and that switching to another frame that can be accessed during a key event is ok? If so, the patch looks ok.

My understanding is that while this bug is security-sensitive, most of the issue itself is public ([CVE-2010-1125](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1125)) with a public testcase (see <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/510070/100/0/threaded>). There seems to be a few parts in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=552255#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - focus() behavior may be used to inject, maybe steal keystrokes") that aren't yet public, but MITRE felt this affected Firefox enough to assign it a CVE already, so if we can go ahead and get this into 1.9.2.4 which hasn't started building yet, it would be better than waiting another 6 weeks.

I was referring to the PoC at <http://lcamtuf.coredump.ca/focus-webkit> - the more complicated case you refer to seems to do strange things on Firefox 3.5.x, but jumps cursor focus out of the box, which isn't really keystroke-stealing, it's focus-stealing :)

Yeah, the second test case does not work as-is, but this seems to be because of unrelated focus() / blur() quirks that will probably get fixed at some point (see my original message), so looks like it's worth keeping in mind anyway.

Michal, this is fixed in the next shipping version of Firefox 3.6. Has the issue been fixed in WebKit yet? I'm trying to coordinate our advisories and need to know if this issue has to remain embargoed. Thanks.

WebKit is still thinking. I think it's OK to mention this in release notes, just not unlock this bug. I will update this bug as soon as they're done.

OK, WebKit is done:
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26824>
<http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/58829>
Given the fact it's moderate risk, I suspect it's going to be several months for all the vendors to pick it up, though; I will probably discuss the additional details before then, given the low risk of things going wrong.

Why use JS at all: <http://pastie.org/1054910> and with HTML5's Boolean attribute 'autofocus' it becomes even easier to create a script-less keystroke stealer: <http://pastie.org/1054917>

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.5.10, fixing various bugs
and security issues.
MFSA 2010-33 / CVE-2008-5913:
Security researcher Amit Klein reported that it was possible to reverse
engineer the value used to seed Math.random(). Since the pseudo-random
number generator was only seeded once per browsing session, this seed
value could be used as a unique token to identify and track users
across different web sites.
MFSA 2010-32 / CVE-2010-1197:
Security researcher Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive reported that
the Content-Disposition: attachment HTTP header was ignored when
Content-Type: multipart was also present. This issue could potentially
lead to XSS problems in sites that allow users to upload arbitrary
files and specify a Content-Type but rely on Content-Disposition:
attachment to prevent the content from being displayed inline.
MFSA 2010-31 / CVE-2010-1125:
Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that focus()
could be used to change a user's cursor focus while they are
typing, potentially directing their keyboard input to an unintended
location. This behavior was also present across origins when content
from one domain was embedded within another via an IFRAME. A malicious
web page could use this behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim
while they were typing sensitive information such as a password.
MFSA 2010-30 / CVE-2010-1199:
Security researcher Martin Barbella reported via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative that an XSLT node sorting routine contained an integer
overflow vulnerability. In cases where one of the nodes to be sorted
contained a very large text value, the integer used to allocate a
memory buffer to store its value would overflow, resulting in too small
a buffer being created. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
write data past the end of the buffer, causing the browser to crash
and potentially running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-29 / CVE-2010-1196:
Security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity reported that the routine
for setting the text value for certain types of DOM nodes contained an
integer overflow vulnerability. When a very long string was passed to
this routine, the integer value used in creating a new memory buffer
to hold the string would overflow, resulting in too small a buffer
being allocated. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write
data past the end of the buffer, causing a crash and potentially
running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-28 / CVE-2010-1198:
Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that two plugin instances
could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a reference to an
object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold that reference
after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is destroyed. In
these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer to freed memory
which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-27 / CVE-2010-0183:
Security researcher wushi of team509 reported that the frame
construction process for certain types of menus could result in a menu
containing a pointer to a previously freed menu item. During the cycle
collection process, this freed item could be accessed, resulting in the
execution of a section of code potentially controlled by an attacker.
MFSA 2010-26 / CVE-2010-1200 / CVE-2010-1201 / CVE-2010-1202 / CVE-2010-1203:
Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2010-25 / CVE-2010-1121:
A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity during the 2010 Pwn2Own
contest sponsored by TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. By moving
DOM nodes between documents Nils found a case where the moved node
incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could
be triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this
freed object. The contest winning exploit only affects Firefox 3.6
and not earlier versions. Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5,
SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the
browser engine were patched just in case there is an alternate way
of triggering the underlying flaw.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-930-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

29 June 2010

Firefox could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file or website.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.2) - XUL + XPCOM application runner

## Details

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

Mozilla has changed the support model for Firefox and they no longer

support version 3.0 of the browser. As a result, Ubuntu is providing an

upgrade to Firefox 3.6 for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS users, which is the most current

stable release of Firefox supported by Mozilla. When upgrading, users

should be aware of the following:

* Firefox 3.6 does not support version 5 of the Sun Java plugin. Please use

  icedtea-java7-plugin or sun-java6-plugin instead.
* After upgrading to Firefox 3.6.6, users may be prompted to upgrade 3rd

  party Add-Ons. In some cases, an Add-On will not be compatible with

  Firefox 3.6.6 and have no update available. In these cases, Firefox will

  notify the user that it is disabling the Add-On.
* Upgrades to Ubuntu 8.10 from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS may break the browser.

  Ubuntu 8.10 is no longer officially supported and users are required to

  upgrade to 9.04 to receive active security support and a functional browser.
* Font configuration cannot be controlled via Gnome settings. This is a

  known issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/559149> and will

  be fixed in a later update.
* helix-player is not currently supported in Firefox 3.6. This is a known

  issue and may be fixed in a future update.
* RealAudio via the totem plugin is no longer supported in Firefox 3.6 in

  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Affected users navigating to Real content will be

  prompted to install optional community supported packages.
* In Ubuntu 8.04 LTS the xine plugin is non-functional. After upgrading to

  Firefox 3.6, the plugin may cause the browser to crash, while in Firefox

  3.0 it would be silently ignored. Users are advised to uninstall

  xine-plugin and/or gxineplugin.
* Plugins using external helpers (such as Totem) may not close when using

  the Epiphany browser. This is a known issue being tracked in

  <https://launchpad.net/bugs/599796> and will be fixed in a later update.

  This issue only affects Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)

* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)

* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

## Details

USN-930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox and Xulrunner. This update

provides updated packages for use with Firefox 3.6 and Xulrunner 1.9.2 on

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-31

## focus() behavior can be used to inject or steal keystrokes

Announced
June 22, 2010
Reporter
Michal Zalewski
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.10
* Firefox 3.6.4
* SeaMonkey 2.0.5

### Description

Google security researcher **Michal Zalewski**
reported that `focus()` could be used to change a user's
cursor focus while they are typing, potentially directing their
keyboard input to an unintended location. This behavior was also
present across origins when content from one domain was embedded
within another via an iframe. A malicious web page could use this
behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim while they were typing
sensitive information such as a password.

firefox security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2010-0500)

Original Release Date: June 25, 2010

Last Revised: July 7, 2011

Number: ASA-2010-165

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1121](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1121.html), [CVE-2010-1200](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1200.html), [CVE-2010-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1202.html) and [CVE-2010-1203](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1203.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for
a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1198](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1198.html) to this issue.

Several integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed
web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1196](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1196.html) and [CVE-2010-1199](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1199.html) to these issues.

A focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A
malicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,
such as usernames and passwords. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1125](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1125.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the "Content-Disposition:
attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
also present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the
"Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent content from being
displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content
to users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1197](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1197.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could
be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different
websites. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-5913](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2008-5913.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.
Certain security checks were not being called when an XML document was
loaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load
certain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its
add-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML
document. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-0182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0182.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0500.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using RHEL4 with the affected version of firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 2.0 including 2.0 SP1 and 2.0 SP2 | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 5.2.2 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.
