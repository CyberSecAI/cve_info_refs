  "CVE-2010-1125": {
    "description": "Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that focus() could be used to change a user's cursor focus while they are typing, potentially directing their keyboard input to an unintended location. This behavior was also present across origins when content from one domain was embedded within another via an IFRAME. A malicious web page could use this behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim while they were typing sensitive information such as a password.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to manipulate focus using the focus() function, allowing for redirection of keyboard input to an unintended location. This issue is exacerbated when cross-origin iframes are involved.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input handling",
        "Cross-origin vulnerability",
		"UI redressing"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can potentially steal sensitive information such as usernames and passwords by redirecting the user's keyboard input.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious web pages"

	   "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to create malicious web pages",
		"Ability to embed an iframe in a web page"

      "mitigation_details": [
         "The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 3.5.10, Firefox 3.6.4, and SeaMonkey 2.0.5.",
		 "The fix involves preventing focusing on a not-same-origin window during user-initiated key events. Or make that kind of focusing asynchronous."
