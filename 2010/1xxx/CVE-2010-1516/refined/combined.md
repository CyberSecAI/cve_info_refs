# SWFTools: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201204-05**

A heap-based buffer overflow in SWFTools could result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/swftools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.9.1** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

SWFTools is a collection of SWF manipulation and generation utilities
written by Rainer Böhme and Matthias Kramm.

### Description

Integer overflow errors in the "getPNG()" function in png.c and the
"jpeg\_load()" function in jpeg.c could cause a heap-based buffer
overflow.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PNG or
JPEG file, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for SWFTools. We recommend that users
unmerge swftools:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "media-gfx/swftools"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to ">=media-gfx/swftools-0.9.1", however
these packages are not currently stable.

| [Description](#c0)  Thomas Tongue    2002-01-25 14:20:13 UTC  ``` When I try to merge Mozilla 0.9.7 into my install, it builds for a while and gives me:  /usr/bin/perl -I../../config ../../config/build-list.pl ../../dist/include/xpcom/.headerlist nsIThread.h nsIThreadPool.h nsIRunnable.h nsIEventQueue.h nsIEventQueueService.h nsIProcess.h make[3]: *** [export] Segmentation fault make[3]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/mozilla-0.9.7/work/mozilla/xpcom/threads' make[2]: *** [export] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/mozilla-0.9.7/work/mozilla/xpcom' make[1]: *** [tier_9] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/mozilla-0.9.7/work/mozilla' make: *** [default] Error 2  !!! ERROR: The ebuild did not complete successfully. !!! Function src_compile, Line 79, Exitcode 2 !!! (no error message)  !!! emerge aborting on  /usr/portage/net-www/mozilla/mozilla-0.9.7.ebuild .  So far I haven't had any trouble with builds on this system. I have X and Gnome up and running, along with the kernel, so I think the system is pretty stable. Suggestions on how to proceed?  (Note: This was submitted with a Nightly Build of Mozilla that I pulled off Mozilla.org, which is ok except that it doesn't satisfy dependencies for other packages, such as Evolution, Nautilus or Galeon...) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-25 18:50:44 UTC  ``` Hmm .. strange, never had any problems building mozilla 0.9.7... ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thomas Tongue    2002-01-31 12:10:04 UTC  ``` I've tried doing the Mozilla build a few more times, and each time it fails in a different spot. It its useful, I can post some of the fail spots, but I think the problem is not with Mozilla but the build environment or parameters. Which is really strange, because I've successfully built the GNOME and KDE environments and they both work great.   A similar problem is cropping up with the latest perl ebuild. See [bug #458](show_bug.cgi?id=458 "RESOLVED FIXED - perl-5.6.1-r2.ebuild does not build properly") for a description of that problem and some more information on my make.conf parameters (I don't think there is anything too whack in there).  I'm open to suggestions or areas of further exploration. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thomas Tongue    2002-01-31 16:44:16 UTC  ``` Here is another example of Mozilla failing to build:  gcc -o crc32.o -c -DOSTYPE=\"Linux2.4\" -DOSARCH=\"Linux\" -DOJI -I./../src  -I../../../dist/include/zlib -I../../../dist/include -I/var/tmp/portage/mozilla-0.9.7-r1/work/mozilla/dist/include/nspr      -I/usr/X11R6/include   -fPIC -I/usr/X11R6/include -Wall -W -Wno-unused -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align -Wno-long-long -mcpu=k6 -march=k6 -O3 -pipe -pthread -pipe  -DNDEBUG -DTRIMMED -O3  -I/usr/X11R6/include -include ../../../config-defs.h -DMOZILLA_CLIENT -Wp,-MD,.deps/crc32.pp crc32.c gcc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11 make[2]: *** [crc32.o] Error 1 make[2]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/mozilla-0.9.7-r1/work/mozilla/modules/zlib/standalone' make[1]: *** [tier_9] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/mozilla-0.9.7-r1/work/mozilla' make: *** [default] Error 2  !!!

(no error message)  !!! emerge aborting on  /usr/portage/net-www/mozilla/mozilla-0.9.7-r1.ebuild . root@stkilda mozilla # cpp0: output pipe has been closed   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-01 16:10:46 UTC  ``` This is due to bad CPU or memory; use "memtest86" (see freshmeat) to test your memory. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thomas Tongue    2002-02-01 17:36:46 UTC  ``` If it were bad memory or CPU, then other large packages would fail as well, such as X or the kernel. I'll try memtest over the weekend, but I seriously doubt that is where the problem lies. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thomas Tongue    2002-02-04 15:33:05 UTC  ``` >humiliation<  This WAS a memory problem. Arg! I tested it 3 weeks ago when I added the RAM and it was fine. Sheesh. Anyway, I've installed new RAM and now it builds just fine. Sorry to wast your time on this. Thanks!   ``` |  |
