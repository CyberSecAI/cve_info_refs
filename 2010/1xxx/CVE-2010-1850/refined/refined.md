Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2010-1850:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `COM_FIELD_LIST` command of the MySQL server, specifically within the `mysql_list_fields()` function. The server fails to properly validate the length of the table name argument sent by the client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. When a client sends an excessively long table name via the `COM_FIELD_LIST` command, the server copies this data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The server does not sanitize or validate the size of the table name received from the client before copying it into the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stack Smashing:** The buffer overflow leads to stack smashing, which can cause the MySQL server (mysqld) to crash.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflowed data, an attacker can potentially inject and execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete server compromise.
- **Data at Risk:** Because the MySQL server runs with file system access, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to access and manipulate all data managed by the MySQL server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `COM_FIELD_LIST` command, which is part of the old MySQL protocol.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending an overly long table name parameter to the `mysql_list_fields` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the MySQL server, meaning they would need valid credentials to connect to the server.
- **Client access:** The attacker would need to send a crafted `COM_FIELD_LIST` command to the MySQL server using a client that does not enforce the length limits that the official `libmysql` client library does. The PHP `mysqlnd` library, when used with versions 5.3.0 and higher, is specifically mentioned as an example of a vulnerable client.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug report mentions that the official `libmysql` library has a protection, but other clients like `mysqlnd` don't.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of MySQL, including 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.6, and potentially older versions like 3.23 and 4.0.
- The fix involves implementing proper bounds checking and input validation on the table name argument in `COM_FIELD_LIST`.
- This issue is identified as "Critical" (S1) severity by the bug report.
- The vulnerability was fixed in MySQL versions 5.0.91, 5.1.47, 5.5.5, 6.0.14, and later versions.
