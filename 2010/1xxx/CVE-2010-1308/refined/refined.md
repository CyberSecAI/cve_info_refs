Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw present in the `com_svmap` component of Joomla. This occurs due to the insecure handling of user-supplied input in the 'controller' parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied input used in the `controller` parameter which allows for arbitrary local file inclusion. The vulnerability allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary local files on the server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `controller` parameter of the `com_svmap` component is vulnerable as it is not properly sanitized, which allows attackers to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server such as `/etc/passwd`, which can lead to information disclosure.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Depending on the server's configuration and the files included, it is possible to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable Joomla installation with a modified `controller` parameter, specifying the path of the file to include. The proof of concept URL is: `http://localhost/index.php?option=com_svmap&controller=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla server.
- **Knowledge of Joomla Installation:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable Joomla installation.
- **Basic Understanding of LFI:** The attacker must be aware of the possibility of local file inclusion attacks and the common techniques used.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Joomla Component `com_svmap` version 1.1.1.
- The exploit was published by "Vrs-hCk".
- The vulnerability was disclosed on 2010-04-05.
