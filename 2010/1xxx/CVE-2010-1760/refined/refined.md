Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2010-1760:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a flaw in the XMLHttpRequest implementation within WebCore's `DocumentThreadableLoader.cpp`. The code does not properly remove credentials when handling cross-origin synchronous requests. This results in a mismatch between request URLs (with credentials) and response URLs (without credentials) during a redirect check, triggering a `NETWORK_ERR`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Credential Handling:** The primary vulnerability lies in the failure to remove credentials from cross-origin synchronous requests before performing a redirect check. The code attempts to compare request and response URLs, and the presence of credentials in the request URL, but not in the response URL, causes the comparison to fail.
*   **Code Duplication:** The initial fix involved modifying multiple code paths to remove credentials, leading to code duplication. This was later addressed by moving the credential removal to the `DocumentThreadableLoader` constructor.
* **Missing Test Cases:** The initial vulnerability was discovered because of a missing test case.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unspecified Impact:** The official CVE description states the impact is "unspecified". The primary impact appears to be that cross-origin requests that include credentials and involve redirects will fail, raising a `NETWORK_ERR` and preventing the resource from being loaded.
*   **Remote Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through remote attack vectors, where a malicious website can attempt to make cross-origin requests that will trigger the flaw.
*   **Denial of Service:** It may be possible that an attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability to cause an application to consistently fail at cross-origin requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to make cross-origin requests to a server that requires authentication.
*   **Cross-Origin Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by cross-origin requests that include credentials.
*   **Redirects:** The issue specifically arises when a cross-origin request results in a redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a webpage:** The attacker needs to control a server to host a web page.
*   **Ability to trick victim into visiting the webpage:** The attacker has to persuade the victim to visit the malicious website using a browser that is vulnerable to CVE-2010-1760.
*   **Knowledge of target domain requiring authentication:** The attacker must know or control a second domain that requires credentials, and the victim must have stored credentials for this domain.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Patch:** The fix involved removing the credentials from the request object at the `DocumentThreadableLoader` level before performing the cross-origin synchronous request. Specifically, in `DocumentThreadableLoader::DocumentThreadableLoader`, the credentials from the request were removed. This was later improved to happen as soon as the `ResourceRequest` object is constructed for cross-origin requests, avoiding issues in different code paths.
*  **Regression:** The vulnerability is described as a regression caused by a previous code movement from XMLHttpRequest to DocumentThreadableLoader.
*   **Firefox Behavior:** Firefox's behavior of raising an exception when a cross-origin request includes credentials (even if they are ignored) was noted, highlighting differing implementations across browsers.
*  **Test Cases:** The fix included the addition of new test cases, including `access-control-preflight-credential-async.html` and  `access-control-preflight-credential-sync.html`. These test cases verify that a cross-origin request with a preflight check does not raise a `NETWORK_ERR` exception and does not send credentials.
*   **Multiple Layers of Credential Stripping**: Credentials are removed at multiple levels in WebKit, including the `DocumentThreadableLoader`, `ResourceHandleInternal`, and network level. This highlights the complexity of credential management.

**In summary:** CVE-2010-1760 is a vulnerability in WebKit's handling of credentials in cross-origin synchronous requests. The vulnerability is caused by a missing step in sanitizing the URL in `DocumentThreadableLoader`, and is exploitable remotely using a maliciously crafted webpage. The impact primarily involves preventing resources from being loaded due to a redirect check failure. The fix involves ensuring credentials are removed at the appropriate location.
