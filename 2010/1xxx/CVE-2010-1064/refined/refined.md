```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to the direct access to the database file (ajxgaleri.mdb) through the web server, without proper access control or authentication.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Database disclosure vulnerability. The lack of proper access control allows unauthorized access to the database file.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can gain access to the entire database, potentially exposing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, personal data, and other confidential data.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is direct access to the database file via a web browser using the known path (e.g., http://localhost/path/db/ajxgaleri.mdb).
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to know or guess the path to the database file and have network access to the vulnerable server.
