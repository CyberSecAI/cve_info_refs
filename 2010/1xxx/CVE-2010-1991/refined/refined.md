{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to redirect image sources to mailto: URLs. This action, when triggered repeatedly, can lead to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is the improper handling of mailto: URLs when used as a source for images or within iframes. This can cause a large number of email clients to open simultaneously, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service. The vulnerability can be exploited via image redirects or by using iframes with mailto: URLs.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This is due to the system being overwhelmed with attempts to open the email client, potentially leading to a complete exhaustion of system resources and a system freeze. Additionally, while not a security risk per se, the opening of numerous email clients can be very disruptive and inconvenient for the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vectors include: 1) Redirecting image sources to mailto: URLs. 2) Embedding iframes with mailto: URLs in a web page, which could be done with JavaScript or by creating a page with a large number of iframes. Both methods lead to an uncontrolled opening of email clients.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a web page (or inject code into a page) that contains either: 1) Image tags with src attributes that redirect to mailto: URLs. 2) Iframes with src attributes that point to mailto: URLs. No specific privileges are needed other than the ability to serve or inject web content. The attacker does not need to be local."
