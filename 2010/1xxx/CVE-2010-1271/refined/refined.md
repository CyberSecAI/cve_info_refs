Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1271

**Vulnerable Software:** Smartplugs version 1.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `showplugs.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `domain` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  The core vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied data is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper validation or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and email addresses of users and administrators.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions and the application's functionality, an attacker may be able to modify or delete data, or potentially gain further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:**  The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `showplugs.php` script, where the `domain` parameter contains the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Smartplugs application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
* The exploit examples provided are:
    *   `www.site.com/smartplugs/showplugs.php?domain=-9999999999'+union+select+1,concat(id,0x3a,username,0x3a,password,0x3a,email),3,4,5,6+from+user--+` - This extracts user information from the "user" table.
    *   `www.site.com/smartplugs/showplugs.php?domain=-9999999999'+union+select+1,concat(username,0x3a,password),3,4,5,6+from+logins--+` - This extracts admin credentials from the "logins" table

This exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to append results to the original query. The attacker uses a negative number as a dummy value and then `UNION SELECT` with `concat` to extract fields of interest.
