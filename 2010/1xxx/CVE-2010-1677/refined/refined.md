Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way MHonArc processes HTML messages with deeply nested tags. Specifically, when parsing malformed HTML with excessively nested tags, MHonArc consumes excessive CPU resources in the process of attempting to strip the data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inefficient HTML Parsing:** The core issue is that MHonArc's HTML parsing logic is not robust enough to handle deeply nested, invalid HTML structures. It appears to get stuck or overwhelmed trying to process these structures, leading to excessive resource consumption.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The software does not properly validate or sanitize HTML input, allowing it to be fed arbitrarily nested tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By sending specially crafted HTML messages with deep tag nesting, an attacker can cause MHonArc to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially making the application unresponsive or unusable for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Email Messages:** The attack vector is primarily through email messages containing malicious HTML. An attacker can send an email to a mailing list or other context processed by MHonArc, with the payload hidden inside the emailâ€™s HTML content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Email:** An attacker needs to be able to send email messages that will be processed by MHonArc. This could be someone posting to a mailing list, or sending directly to an email address that uses the vulnerable software.
*   **Craft Malicious HTML:** The attacker must be capable of crafting the malicious HTML with the required deep tag nesting.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified in MHonArc version 2.6.16.
*   The issue was fixed in version 2.6.17.
*   The fix involves modifying the `mhtxthtml.pl` filter to reject any message with nested tags, effectively preventing the processing of malicious HTML.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a Security issue with a severity of 6.
