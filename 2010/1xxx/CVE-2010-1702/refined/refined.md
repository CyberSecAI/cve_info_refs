  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the `deptid` parameter of the `submitticket.php` script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration (e.g. user credentials), data modification, or complete database compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface. An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP GET request to the `submitticket.php` script with a manipulated `deptid` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable WHMCS instance and be able to send HTTP requests."
