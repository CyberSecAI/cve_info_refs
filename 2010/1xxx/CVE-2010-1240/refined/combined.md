### Escape From PDF

Filed under: [Hacking](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/hacking/),[PDF](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/pdf/) — Didier Stevens @ 19:46

This is a special PDF hack: I managed to make a PoC PDF to execute an embedded executable without exploiting any vulnerability!

I use a launch action triggered by the opening of my PoC PDF. With Adobe Reader, the user gets a warning asking for approval to launch the action, but I can (partially) control the message displayed by the dialog. Foxit Reader displays no warning at all, the action gets executed without user interaction.

PDF viewers like Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader don’t allow embedded executables (like binaries and scripts) to be extracted and executed:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-201757.png?w=610&h=314 "20100329-201757")

But I found another way to launch a command (/Launch /Action), and ultimately run an executable I embedded using a special technique. With Adobe Reader, a launch action needs to be approved by the user:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-201213.png?w=478&h=262 "20100329-201213")

But I can partially control the message displayed by this dialog box:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-211248.png?w=478&h=262 "20100329-211248")

I can use this to social-engineer users to “Open” the file:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-211313.png?w=478&h=262 "20100329-211313")

Do you believe this could this mislead some of your users? Or maybe you can come up with a better message to fool your users.

With Foxit Reader, no warning is displayed:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/20100329-211310.png?w=457&h=385 "20100329-211310")

I’m not publishing my PoC PDF yet, but you can download a PDF that will just launch cmd.exe [here](http://didierstevens.com/files/data/launch-action-cmd.zip). Use it to test your PDF reader.

With Adobe Reader, the only thing preventing execution is a warning. Disabling JavaScript will not prevent this (I don’t use JavaScript in my PoC PDF), and patching Adobe Reader isn’t possible (I’m not exploiting a vulnerability, just being creative with the PDF language specs).

I shared my PoC with Adobe’s PSIRT. Maybe they will come up with a solution to prevent this, should they consider that the protection offered by the warning dialog is not sufficient. BTW, [preventing Adobe Reader from creating new processes](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2009/10/05/preventing-applications-from-starting-malicious-applications/) blocks this trick.

In this case, Foxit Reader is probably worse than Adobe Reader, because no warning gets displayed to prevent the launch action. My PoC PDF requires some changes for Foxit Reader, because ultimately, the executable doesn’t run. But that’s probably due to some variation in the PDF language supported by Foxit Reader.

Tested with Adobe Reader 9.3.1 on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7.

1. PDF-XChange Viewer (2.0 Build 44) seems to be safe. It displays a clear (not faked) warning. And when I confirm with “yes” I get an error. Nothing else happens.

3. @Christoph Thanks for testing. FYI: I don’t manipulate the warning dialog in the PDF I offer for download.

5. Nice work on the messing with the warning box. The workaround to block acrobat blocking process was interesting too – it seems crazy that “enhanced security” mode in acrobat doesn’t disable the /launch action.

   FYI a cross reader/os version (albeit without message box bit) has been published a while ago from Fred Raynal:

   /OpenAction <<

   /F <>

   /S /Launch

   >>

   Also available here: <http://seclabs.org/fred/docs/sstic09/samples/actions/launch/calc.pdf>

7. Ok so can’t post < in the comments 🙂

   This is the interesting bit anyways:

   /F

   /DOS (C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\calc.exe)

   /Unix (/usr/bin/xcalc)

   /Mac (/Applications/Calculator.app)

   Or just look at the link if this doesn’t work 😉

9. Nice!

   The lack of user confirmation in Foxit makes me remember a somewhat similar vulnerability I’ve reported a year ago in Foxit Reader: it didn’t require user confirmation before launching an executable via the “Open/Execute a file” action. (Just local executables, no arbitrary embedded exes at that time).

   <http://www.coresecurity.com/content/foxit-reader-vulnerabilities>

   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2009-0836>

   Seems like the flaw remained alive somewhere!

11. In the case of foxit, I also did notice it executes without warning, however it doesn’t seem posible to pass parameters to whatever command you launch. If that is the case it sorts of renders the vulnerability useless, what do you think?

13. Hi,

    This as been available in metasploit for months now:

    <http://blog.attackresearch.com/publications/metaphish/>

    <http://www.metasploit.com/redmine/projects/framework/repository/revisions/8379/changes/modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/adobe_pdf_embedded_exe.rb>

    You can also name the exe acroread.exe to make it less suspicious

15. @Mat I think there is a way…

    Comment by [Didier Stevens](https://didierstevens.wordpress.com/) — Tuesday 30 March 2010 @ [7:03](#comment-37904)
17. @racinedestyle No, I had a look at the Ruby code, my PoC is different. Although we both use a launch action for cmd.exe, I don’t use JavaScript, embedding and extracting is totally different, and I control the content of the dialog box.

    But I’ve contacted Colin with details of my PoC.

    Comment by [Didier Stevens](https://didierstevens.wordpress.com/) — Tuesday 30 March 2010 @ [7:05](#comment-37905)
19. Nice post and PoC, congrats Didier!

    From my tests with “launch\_action\_cmd.pdf”, PDF-XChange Viewer under Windows7 shows a legit warning message:

    “The application “%1″ is set to be launched by this PDF file.

    The file may contain program, macros or viruses that may potentially harm your computer.

    Only open if you are sure it is safe.”

    Also once accepted the message, tries to open the wrong path for cmd.exe and fails. The PATH used I suppose is the current PATH of the PDF file.

21. I just checked with Sumatra PDF Reader (using the Portable version from portableapps.com), and it simply ignores the command to open the cmd.exe. I get the page, but no window. 🙂

35. Hi,

    a kind of this foxit exploit is already within metasploit (I guess the one Francisco mentioned). I used this in a PoC to “rcp” a reverse\_shell.exe into the users startup folder. Worked like a charm.

    The last time I used it was in late December 09. I’ve no idea if it is fixed already.

    On Ubuntu 10.04, using Evince Viewer 2.29.92, no reaction (I think this is normal 😉

    I’m not considering this as a “vulnerability”, except for software that doesn’t show dialog box before execution !!! Is there a list of potential vulnerable software ? It can be interesting for MetaSploit PoC 😉

    This is the thing behind the “control the box”. The problem is to get the \nline1\nline2\nline3 part away before the execution because the exec fails with the \nline1\nline2\nline3 trail garbage.

113. Regarding Linux and Macs: I’m sure nobody expected those OS to open cmd.exe, but if it is possible to execute programs then both OS should have displayed an error message, for example “cmd.exe not found” or something. I know that failure to display such a message doesn’t mean that those OS are safe, but I think it’s a first indicator.

133. @Sigtrap Tested with latest version 3.2.0.0303. Assume older versions exhibit same behavior.

135. […] Didier Stevens found the vulnerability/ design flaw. Essentially it allows you to include executable files within a .pdf file, and auto-execute them as soon as the PDF is viewed! What’s more is that it doesn’t require javascript to be enabled. The PDF format does not allow you to embed binaries, but there is a ‘Launch Action’ which can launch a command, Didier has manipulated this to execute embedded data and he has even managed to manipulate the user warning shown below to display a custom message. […]

137. @Sigtrap and Didier Stevens

     I have now tried the cmd.exe-PDF with Foxit version 1.3. This is the version I use at home. No known(?) vulnerabilities in that old version.

     Foxit 1.3 doesn’t launch anything when launch-action-cmd.pdf is opened.

     What vulnerabilities are there in Foxit 1.3? Newer versions has lots more features, and more vulnerabilities. I don’t need the features so I stay with version 1.3. And version 1.3 is only one 2.6MB static binary.

     btw Foxitreader

     Opening your launch-action-cmd.pdf via Commandline with parameter -n like :

     “C:\Programme\Foxit Software\Foxit Reader\foxit reader.exe” “C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\Surf\Desktop\launch-action-cmd\launch-action-cmd.pdf” -n 1

     will prevent the launch of the embedded executable.

209. @lurk I believe Foxit Reader 1.3 has no support for Launch Actions. So it just ignores it; That’s what all PDF readers do (AFAIK): if they encounter an unknown keyword during the parsing process, they just ignore it. This way, they can still render documents with a higher PDF language version number than the one the reader is supporting.

225. @Adger Yes, like you can see in the video, it actually launches a file embedded in the PDF. But it’s not embedded according to the PDF standards, I use another technique.

     The sample PDF just launches cmd.exe. I’ve not disclosed my PoC. As a first step, the PoC also launches cmd.exe. But then it takes 4 extra steps, that ultimately launch an embedded, arbitrary executable.

323. @Al Nope it doesn’t work in Preview. Acrobat Reader on the Mac will launch Firefox but it first opens up Terminal and then opens Firefox, just tested it about 5 mins ago. Also the Acrobat Reader version on Mac doesn’t allow you to pass arguments/parameters to it, so its functionality is limited.

345. Folks in my LJ have pointed out that, of course, the embedded command in the text file is, specifically, a Windows command. Of course it’s not going to work in Mac or Linux.

     The question is, if the function call is replaced by the appropriate ‘Nix command, will it work? And if it doesn’t work, is that due to “superior OS security”, or just the erratic feature support that us Linux users all bitch about when it interferes with things we want to do, and gloat about when it interferes with potential hazards?

     I lack the ‘Fu to make the appropriate test files myself; I’m going to try the version linked in the comments above.

     tried /F (cmd.exe /params)

     /F (cmd.exe)(/params)

     /F (cmd.exe) /params

     didnt work.

     And this does not open aterm or gimp or anything on linux. Adobe throws the file exec warning what I OK down then nothing happens (Adobe reader 9.1.2).

351. The test file that is supposed to run cmd.exe does not function correctly when it is opened with Acrobat reader 6.02 running on windows 98. I get this error: There was an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be repaired.

     Win-98 does not have cmd.exe. I copied calc.exe to cmd.exe but still got the same error. Conclusion: Windows 98 continues to be largely invulnerable to most malware, viruses, trojans, etc.

367. I’v tried posting this several times since 3/30, but it hasn’t gone through. Going to try it again, this time by obfuscating the URLs:

     Actions (including Launch) have been in the PDF spec since 1.1 (1996).

     There are many similar examples of this, including:

     – readme of vpe from 2000: www[dot]cam[dot]ctan[dot]org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/vpe/vpe.txt

     – Portable Document Format (PDF) Security Analysis and Malware Threats paper www[dot]blackhat[dot]com/presentations/bh-europe-08/Filiol/Presentation/bh-eu-08-filiol.pdf#page=12

     – samples (including the one Paul mentions above) code[dot]google[dot]com/p/origami-pdf/source/browse/#hg/samples/launch

     See also:

     – esec[dot]fr[dot]sogeti[dot]com/blog/index.php?2009/06/26/68-at-least-4-ways-to-die-opening-a-pdf

     – esec[dot]fr[dot]sogeti[dot]com/blog/index.php?2009/07/06/70-is-this-pdf-malicious

     You can make other PDF viewers (such as Nuance and PDF-XChange Viewer “vulnerable” to this by including the full path (as the spec describes) in a manner that Paul mentions in his 2nd post. I.e., include 4 backslashes for every backslash in the path.

     @Mat: you can provide the /P (insert parameters here) action to pass parameters to the file you specify in /F (path\filename)

369. “I managed to make a PoC PDF to execute an embedded executable without exploiting any vulnerability!”

     Technically, no. You did have to exploit two vulnerabilities:

     1. The fact that the wording of a security alert can be altered to hide what’s actually being opened by the PDF IS a vulnerability (of the application I believe, unless the PDF spec REQUIRES you to put that text before/instead of the actual URI in any warning message, in which case it’s a vulnerability baked into the specification.)

     2. While not a vulnerability in the application or the spec, there is still the ultimate vulnerability behind the keyboard/mouse that decides to open the file. 😛

     Eliminate the first vulnerability, and the risk posed by the second vulnerability decreases (but probably not enough… 😉

381. […] The Register segnala che Didier Stevens, ricercatore di sicurezza, ha dimostrato che è possibile annidare codice ostile eseguibile – un virus, insomma – all’interno di un documento PDF. Aprendo un documento del genere con Adobe Reader, normalmente compare una finestra di dialogo che chiede all’utente se vuole procedere, ma Stevens è riuscito a manipolarne il testo in modo che inganni buona parte degli utenti. Disabilitare Javascript è inutile e non è possibile rimediare aggiornando Reader, perché secondo Stevens non si tratta di una vulnerabilità, ma soltanto di un uso “creativo delle specifiche del linguaggio PDF”. Sono disponibili un video e un PDF dimostrativo. […]

433. Didier-

     Thank you for this entry.

     On downloading PDFs from unknown sources, it got me to wondering, aside from scanning the documents, what other easy precautions non-technical users can take.

     1. First, what is PoC? A search at acronymfinder.com returned nothing relevant.

     2. If I understand you correctly, as a safety precaution, you recommend UNCHECKING “Enable Acrobat JavaScript” in Adobe Acrobat under Preferences –> JavaScript, and UNCHECKING “Allow documents to open other files and launch other applications” under Preferences –> Trust Manager, as default settings, correct?

     3. Are there other Preference settings you recommend in Acrobat to further increase security against malware? Or any other precautions with respect to PDFs?

     4. Also, with JavaScript disabled, is there an obvious notification in Acrobat if it should be required, in much the same fashion as Firefox’s NoScript extension (which I use).

     Sorry for the basic questions. Thank you, MK Ross

435. I have literally been waiting for people to wake up and speak out about this adobe hack, infact there are some that run without you doing anything other than going to a site. It hooks right into your AcroRd32.exe and give out some nice maleware. That whole windows security spoof where it would replace your security center with a fake one where all the links would send you to some website. Anyways i hope they get a handle on it.

449. You can hex-edit the .pdf file and substitute the (cmd.exe) with another 3-letter .EXE (as long as the file is in the system path). Hex-editing might allow this exploit to launch a file under Linux or a Mac OS. I use Foxit Reader v3.1.4.1125 – the exploit worked without warning me.

     If you use a process blocker program (I use ProcessGuard v3.500), it will stop the execution of the external program.

469. Does anyone know if a signature or regex could be created that looks for the /OpenAction within a PDF file? Is there really any reason that a valid PDF file should be using the /OpenAction switch? I would like to implement an IDS block for this type of signature if it won’t cause any problems with valid PDFs.

475. Thanks Didier, PDFiD is a nice tool. However that still leaves the question if an IPS signature that blocks any packets that match the signature/regex “/OpenAction”, would it block a lot of perfectly valid PDFs? My plan is to implement this block on an enterprise webproxy, and email gateways. After reading your post on Disarming a PDF file it seems like adding /AA, /JS and /JavaScript to the list may also be a good idea.

     I try to do like this:

565. Hi,

     I’m on windows Vista. I downloaded the make-pdf-embedded.py in “https://blog.didierstevens.com/2009/07/01/embedding-and-hiding-files-in-pdf-documents/” and start trying to use it.

     I put in the same folder, the py files and calc.exe. I used it in this way:

     make-pdf-embedded.py -a calc.exe test.pdf

     The pdf is created but when I run it, it is only written “This files embeds calc.exe” and nothing happened. No warning message even I use the -b and -m option.

     But when I download your example file “http://didierstevens.com/files/data/launch-action-cmd.zip”, it works pretty well, I have the warning and the cmd window opened.

     Could you explain me what I’m doing wrong please?

     Congrats for your articles and thank you for your answer.

587. In the case of foxit, I also did notice it executes without warning, however it doesn’t seem posible to pass parameters to whatever command you launch. If that is the case it sorts of renders the vulnerability useless, what do you think?

### Quickpost: No Escape From PDF

Filed under: [PDF](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/pdf/),[Quickpost](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/quickpost/),[Vulnerabilities](https://blog.didierstevens.com/category/vulnerabilities/) — Didier Stevens @ 18:41

Adobe has released a new Adobe Reader version with a fix for [my /Launch action PoC PDF](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2010/03/29/escape-from-pdf/).

Before version 9.3.3:

Since version 9.3.3:

![](https://blog.didierstevens.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/29-06-2010-20-27-37.png?w=478&h=223 "29-06-2010 20-27-37")

Not only is the dialog box fixed, but the /Launch action is also disabled by default.

9. I know this is a lazy comment but can you confirm that either the /Launch command can not be enabled or that if it can be (through registry setting?), the message box is still mandatory and can not be modified ?

11. Did you see this reference to an easy bypass of the ‘fix’? It appears in comments to ISC’s story on the patch.

Alert
# Adobe Reader and Acrobat Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA10-231A

### Systems Affected

* Adobe Reader 9.3.3 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX
* Adobe Acrobat 9.3.3 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh
* Adobe Reader 8.2.3 and earlier versions for Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX
* Adobe Acrobat 8.2.3 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh

### Overview

Adobe has released Security Bulletin [APSB10-17](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-17.html), which describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Acrobat.

Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB10-17](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-17.html) describes a number of vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Acrobat. These vulnerabilities affect Reader and Acrobat 9.3.3, earlier 9.x versions, 8.2.3, and earlier 8.x versions.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file. The Adobe Reader browser plug-in, which can automatically open PDF documents hosted on a website, is available for multiple web browsers and operating systems.

### Impact

These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, write arbitrary files or folders to the file system, escalate local privileges, or cause a denial of service on an affected system as the result of a user opening a malicious PDF file.

### Solution

**Update**

Adobe has released updates to address this issue. Users are encouraged to read Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB10-17](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-17.html) and update vulnerable versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat.

Disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat

Disabling JavaScript may prevent some exploits from resulting in code execution. Acrobat JavaScript can be disabled using the Preferences menu (Edit -> Preferences -> JavaScript; uncheck Enable Acrobat JavaScript).

Adobe provides a framework to [blacklist specific JavaScipt APIs](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/504/cpsid_50431.html). If JavaScript must be enabled, this feature may be useful when specific APIs are known to be vulnerable or used in attacks.

Prevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF files

The installer for Adobe Reader and Acrobat configures Internet Explorer to automatically open PDF files without any user interaction. This behavior can be reverted to a safer option that prompts the user by importing the following as a .REG file:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\AcroExch.Document.7]
"EditFlags"=hex:00,00,00,00

Disable the display of PDF files in the web browser

Preventing PDF files from opening inside a web browser will partially mitigate this vulnerability. If this workaround is applied, it may also mitigate future vulnerabilities.

To prevent PDF files from automatically being opened in a web browser, do the following:

1. Open Adobe Acrobat Reader.
2. Open the Edit menu.
3. Choose the Preferences option.
4. Choose the Internet section.
5. Uncheck the "Display PDF in browser" checkbox.

Do not access PDF files from untrusted sources

Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF files, particularly those hosted on websites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](/ncas/tips/ST04-010.html).
