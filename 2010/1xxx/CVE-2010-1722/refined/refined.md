  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Joomla! component Online Market version 2.x is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include local files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By manipulating the 'controller' parameter in the URL, an attacker can include local files on the server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
    "additional_information": "The exploit URL includes `index.php?option=com_market&controller=[LFI]`. A Proof of Concept URL is provided which attempts to access the `/etc/passwd` file: `http://localhost/index.php?option=com_market&controller=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`. The `%00` is used to null-byte terminate the path, potentially bypassing some checks."
