The provided content is a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities in various third-party TYPO3 extensions. This advisory is related to the CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple extensions are vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to potentially manipulate database queries. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Affected extensions include:
    *   Brainstorming (brainstorming)
    *   Educator (educator)
    *   Diocese of Portsmouth Database (pd_diocesedatabase)
    *   SAV Filter Alphabetic (sav_filter_abc)
    *   SAV Filter Selectors (sav_filter_selectors)
    *   SAV Filter Months (sav_filter_months)
    *   Book Reviews (sk_bookreview) (Medium severity, also listed as SQLi)
    *   Simple Gallery (sk_simplegallery) (Also includes XSS)
     *   TGM-Newsletter (tgm_newsletter)(Also includes XSS)
    *   YATSE - Yet another TYPO3 search engine (yatse) (Also includes XSS)

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Some extensions are vulnerable to blind SQL injection, where attackers cannot directly see the results of their queries, but can still infer information by observing the application's behavior. Affected extensions include:
    *   MK Wastebasket (mk_wastebasket)
    *   CleanDB (nf_cleandb)
    *   CleanDB - DBAL (tmsw_cleandb)
     *   Meet Travelmates (travelmate)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple extensions are vulnerable to XSS, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. Affected extensions include:
    *   Sellector.com Widget Integration (chsellector)
    *   myDashboard (mydashboard)
    *   Reports Logfile View (reports_logview)
    *   Simple Gallery (sk_simplegallery) (Also includes SQLi)
    *    Typo3 Quixplorer (t3quixplorer)
     *   UserTask Center, recent (taskcenter_recent)
       *    TGM-Newsletter (tgm_newsletter)(Also includes SQLi)
        *   YATSE - Yet another TYPO3 search engine (yatse) (Also includes SQLi)
*  **Information Disclosure:** One extension is vulnerable to information disclosure.
     * Power Extension Manager (ch_lightem)
*   **Authentication Bypass:** One extension is vulnerable to authentication bypass.
    *  TYPO3 Security - Salted user password hashes (t3sec_saltedpw)
**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database through SQL injection.
*   **Account Hijacking:** XSS vulnerabilities could be used to steal user session cookies and gain unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Malware Distribution:** XSS could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware into the page.
*   **Denial of Service:** Exploitation could potentially lead to denial-of-service conditions in some cases.
*   **Information Leakage:** Vulnerabilities could leak sensitive system or application information.
*   **Authentication bypass**: Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** All vulnerabilities are exploitable through the web interface of the TYPO3 application and the vulnerable extensions.
*   **User Interaction:** XSS vulnerabilities rely on user interaction, such as clicking a malicious link or viewing a compromised page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the TYPO3 application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers need knowledge of the specific vulnerabilities in the affected extensions.
*   **Some level of skill:** Exploitation might require some level of technical skill, especially in crafting SQL injection queries.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Uninstall vulnerable extensions:** The advisory recommends uninstalling and deleting extensions that are no longer maintained.
*   **Update vulnerable extensions:** Updated versions of some vulnerable extensions are available and should be installed.
*   **Follow security best practices:** The advisory recommends following the TYPO3 Security Cookbook, which provides guidance for setting up a secure TYPO3 installation.

In summary, this document details multiple security vulnerabilities found in several third-party TYPO3 extensions. It identifies the type of each vulnerability, provides solutions when possible and informs the user on how to proceed if no solution is available.
