    "Vulnerability": "Stack overflow in OpenDCHub v0.8.1",
    "Description": "OpenDCHub v0.8.1 is vulnerable to a stack overflow due to improper sanitization of user's MyINFO message. A remote attacker with a valid OpenDCHub account can send a specially crafted MyINFO message to other users, resulting in a denial of service (opendchub crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running opendchub.",
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of the MyINFO message content",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash), potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted MyINFO message to a user or all users on a Direct Connect network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs a valid OpenDCHub account."
