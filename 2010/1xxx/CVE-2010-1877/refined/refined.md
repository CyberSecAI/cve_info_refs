Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla! Component JTM Reseller 1.9 Beta is vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability lies in how the component handles user input in the `author` parameter within the URL. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  SQL Injection. The component directly uses the unsanitized `author` parameter from the URL in a SQL query.

*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform database operations. The provided exploit example demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table. This could lead to unauthorized access to the application, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable component's search functionality. The attacker manipulates the `author` parameter in the URL.
    Example: `http://127.0.0.1/index.php?option=com_jtm&view=search&view=search&author=[MALICIOUS SQL CODE]`

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special access or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability since the vulnerable parameter is directly accessible without authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit details provided (e.g., the SQL injection payload ` -666/**/union/**/all/**/select/**/concat_ws(0x3a,username,password)/**/from/**/jos_users--&task=search`) give more detailed context than a basic CVE description.
* The provided dork `inurl:"CIHUY" ;)`  is a useful method of locating vulnerable installations of this component.
