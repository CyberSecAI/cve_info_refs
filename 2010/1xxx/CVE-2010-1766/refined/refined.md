{
  "CVE-2010-1766": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability exists in WebKit's WebSocketHandshake::readServerHandshake() function due to an off-by-one memory corruption flaw. This can be exploited by a malicious WebSocket server by sending a crafted handshake header.",
    "Root cause": "Off-by-one error in the `WebSocketHandshake::readServerHandshake()` function when processing WebSocket handshake headers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption vulnerability due to incorrect bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers could potentially cause a denial-of-service or execute arbitrary code on the user's system by exploiting this vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By tricking a user into connecting to a malicious WebSocket server.",
       "Sending crafted, long, invalid WebSocket handshake headers from a malicious server."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to control a WebSocket server that a user's client connects to.",
      "Ability to send arbitrary WebSocket upgrade headers."
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability was addressed by improving the bounds checking in the `WebSocketHandshake::readServerHandshake()` function. The fix was made in svn commit 56380 and this fix does not affect webkitgtk as provided in Fedora since the version they provide is 1.2.0 which included the fix."
