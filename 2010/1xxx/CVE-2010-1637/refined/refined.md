{
  "cveId": "CVE-2010-1637",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plug-in. If an administrator enabled this plug-in, a SquirrelMail user could use this flaw to port scan the local network the server was on.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plugin, which emulates a POP3 fetcher using fsockopen(), does not perform any verification on IP addresses or ports.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of fsockopen()",
      "Lack of input validation on IP/Port fields"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use the vulnerable plugin to perform port scans, potentially disclosing internal network topology and available services, bypassing firewall restrictions.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Abuse of the Mail Fetch plugin functionality",
       "Manipulation of IP/Port settings in POP3 fetcher"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid SquirrelMail account and the Mail Fetch plugin enabled by the administrator.",
    "affectedComponents": [
      "SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plugin"
    ]
  },
  "additionalNotes": [
    "This vulnerability was discovered during Hack In The Box Dubai 2010.",
    "The vulnerability is post-authentication only.",
    "A fix is available in the SquirrelMail source repository.",
     "The next release of SquirrelMail (1.4.21) will restrict the port number to the standard POP3 port, which would remove the possibility that someone can use SquirrelMail to port-scan your internal network.  Administrators will be able to add other allowable port numbers, or open it back up to any and all port numbers if they so feel they need to.",
     "Red Hat has rated this issue as having low security impact."
