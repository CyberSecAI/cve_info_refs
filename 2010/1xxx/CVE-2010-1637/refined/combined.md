Here goes, there isn't a lot of data on these.

For Squirrelmail:

Here are some important notes from the slide:
        * Default plugin <mail_fetch>, emulates POP3 fetcher with fsockopen()
          PHP functions, Post Authentication only
            - No verification on IP / PORTS
        * You can transform SquirrelMail as a kind of Nmap scanner

        This has been assigned TEHTRI-SA-2010-009 by the discoverer.

        The danger is that this attack could be used to bypass a firewall.

Let's use CVE-2010-1637 for Squirrelmail.

For Horde:

        * You can transform a default Horde installation to a kind of
          advanced network TCP scanner with banner grabbing, etc

        Pre-auth

        TEHTRI-SA-2010-010

Let's use CVE-2010-1638 for Horde

If anyone has more links or information for these, please pass them along.
Thanks.

## Synopsis

Moderate: squirrelmail security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0103)

## Topic

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail
performed the sanitization of HTML style tag content. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) message that, when opened by a victim, would lead to
arbitrary web script execution in the context of their SquirrelMail
session. (CVE-2011-2023)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. A
remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to execute arbitrary web
script in the context of a victim's SquirrelMail session. (CVE-2010-4555)

An input sanitization flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled the
content of various HTML input fields. A remote attacker could use this
flaw to alter user preference values via a newline character contained in
the input for these fields. (CVE-2011-2752)

It was found that the SquirrelMail Empty Trash and Index Order pages did
not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into SquirrelMail, into
visiting a specially-crafted URL, the attacker could empty the victim's
trash folder or alter the ordering of the columns on the message index
page. (CVE-2011-2753)

SquirrelMail was allowed to be loaded into an HTML sub-frame, allowing a
remote attacker to perform a clickjacking attack against logged in users
and possibly gain access to sensitive user data. With this update, the
SquirrelMail main frame can only be loaded into the top most browser frame.
(CVE-2010-4554)

A flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A
user preference file was created when attempting to log in with a password
containing an 8-bit character, even if the username was not valid. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk
space on the target SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2010-2813)

A flaw was found in the SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plug-in. If an
administrator enabled this plug-in, a SquirrelMail user could use this flaw
to port scan the local network the server was on. (CVE-2010-1637)

Users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=606459#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-21 16:51:48 UTC  ``` TEHTRI-Security reported:   [1] <http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2010dxb/materials/D1%20-%20Laurent%20Oudot%20-%20Improving%20the%20Stealthiness%20of%20Web%20Hacking.pdf#page=69>    a deficiency in the way SquirrelMail's Mail Fetch plugin retrieved user's electronic mail from POP3 servers using non-standard port numbers. An authenticated, remote user could use this flaw to conduct port-scan attacks, potentially leading to disclosure of the network typography (DNS scan) and information about available services (port scan), when this information was intended to be protected by firewall.

Sorry for the delay.  A fix for this issue is now available in the
SquirrelMail source repository.  A new stable version (1.4.21) with
this fix will be released in the next week or two.  Links to the
patches if you need them now are:

Development version (1.5.2):
<http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/squirrelmail/?rev=13950&view=rev>
Stable version (1.4.21):
<http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/squirrelmail/?rev=13951&view=rev>

But there *is* a solution to the fact that they can connect to *any*
port on a local machine using this method.  There isn't really a good
reason not to simply restrict the port number to the standard POP3
port, which would then remove the possibility that someone can use
SquirrelMail to port-scan your internal network.  The next release of
SquirrelMail will do just that, and provide administrators a
configuration option where they can add other allowable port numbers,
or open it back up to any and all port numbers if they so feel they
need to.

Indeed, however, a port scan is still more than some administrators want.

I don't think the question is about whether or not the vulnerability
can be scripted.  The issue is that there *is* a vulnerability at all
(albeit a very minor one).  I have thus applied for a CVE recently and
can report back when I receive it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=618096#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-07-26 06:16:26 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail processed random login attempts with 8-bit characters in the password. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the server system potentially to run out of the hard disk space via random login attempts, causing SquirrelMail temporarily to accept the login and create a preferences file for the given username.  References:   [1] <http://www.squirrelmail.org/security/issue/2010-07-23>  Upstream patch:   [2] <http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail/branches/SM-1_4-STABLE/squirrelmail/functions/imap_general.php?view=patch&r1=13972&r2=13971&pathrev=13972>  Affected Versions: <= v1.4.20  Register Globals:   Register_globals does not have to be on for this issue.
