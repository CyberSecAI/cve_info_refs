      "description": "A design issue exists in WebKit's handling of HTML document fragments. The contents of HTML document fragments are processed before a fragment is actually added to a document. Visiting a maliciously crafted website could lead to a cross-site scripting attack if a legitimate website attempts to manipulate a document fragment containing untrusted data. This issue is addressed by ensuring that initial fragment parsing has no side effects on the document that created the fragment.",
