{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in nsGenericDOMDataNode::SetTextInternal().",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer overflow due to integer overflow when calculating buffer size, leading to insufficient buffer allocation and subsequent memcpy overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Crash and potential arbitrary code execution due to writing data past the allocated buffer.",
  "Attack vectors": "By passing a very long string to the SetTextInternal() function of certain DOM nodes, it's possible to trigger the integer overflow which leads to heap overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to manipulate or inject large strings through the DOM API, typically through a crafted webpage."
