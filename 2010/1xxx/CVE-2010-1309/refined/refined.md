```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `includes/template-loader.php` file, where the `_Root_Path` variable is included directly in an include statement without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `_Root_Path` parameter via a GET request.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application doesn't sanitize user-supplied input when constructing the path for file inclusion, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can use this vulnerability to read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files containing database credentials, or system files like /etc/passwd.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `includes/template-loader.php` file, manipulating the `_Root_Path` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required. The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable script.
