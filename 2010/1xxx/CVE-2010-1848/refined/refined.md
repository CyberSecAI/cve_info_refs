{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The MySQL server was not validating the table name argument provided to the COM_FIELD_LIST command, allowing path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
       "Bypassing table level grants"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user with limited privileges could bypass table-level grants and potentially access or modify data from any table in all databases on the server, or even other MySQL instances accessible through the server's file system. In some versions, this could lead to arbitrary code execution as the user running mysqld.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious table name with path components (e.g., '../db/table') in the COM_FIELD_LIST command.",
    "required_capabilities": "An authenticated user with some privileges on any database. No root access is required"
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "MySQL 5.0 and up (prior to fixes)",
  ],
   "patches": [
    "The server was modified to validate the table name argument of the COM_FIELD_LIST command, rejecting any path components in quoted table names."
  ],
  "cve": "CVE-2010-1848",
  "description": "The server failed to check the table name argument of a COM_FIELD_LIST command packet for validity and compliance to acceptable table name standards. This could be exploited to bypass almost all forms of checks for privileges and table level grants by providing a specially crafted table name argument to COM_FIELD_LIST."
