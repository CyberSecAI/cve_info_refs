  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the browser's handling of mailto: URLs, specifically when these URLs are used in image src redirects or iframes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of mailto: URLs in image redirects and iframes.",
        "Lack of resource limits when opening multiple email clients or consuming resources.",
         "Browsers are vulnerable to opening mail clients or resource exhaustion via crafted HTML."

This can manifest as either: a) the user's email client repeatedly opening, becoming unresponsive and effectively blocking the user's machine, or b) complete exhaustion of computer resources, potentially leading to system freezes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Embedding an image with a `src` attribute that redirects to a `mailto:` URL.",
