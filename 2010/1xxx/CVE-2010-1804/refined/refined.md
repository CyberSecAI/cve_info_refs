- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An implementation issue in the network bridge related to handling of DHCP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of maliciously crafted DHCP replies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause the device to stop processing network traffic, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a maliciously crafted DHCP reply to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the device, which may be on the same local network. The device must be configured as a bridge or in NAT mode with a default host enabled.
