Reported by Eugene Teo. While creating a file on a server which supports
Unix extensions such as Samba, if a file being created does not supply
nameidata (i.e. nd is NULL), cifs client can trigger a NULL pointer
dereference when calling cifs_posix_open().

## Linux kernel UNIX Extensions CIFS NULL Pointer Dereference

[with one comment](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/linux-kernel-unix-extensions-cifs-null-pointer-dereference/#comments)

A few days ago Eugene Teo [repoerted a vulnerability in Linux kernel’s CIFS code](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.file-systems.cifs/5782) to the linux-cifs-client mailing list. If we have a quick look at fs/cifs/dir.c of 2.6.32 release of the Linux kernel we can read the following.

```

/* Inode operations in similar order to how they appear in Linux file fs.h */

int
cifs_create(struct inode *inode, struct dentry *direntry, int mode,
                struct nameidata *nd)
      ...
        if (tcon->unix_ext && (tcon->ses->capabilities & CAP_UNIX) &&
            (CIFS_UNIX_POSIX_PATH_OPS_CAP &
                        le64_to_cpu(tcon->fsUnixInfo.Capability))) {
                rc = cifs_posix_open(full_path, &newinode, nd->path.mnt,
                                     mode, oflags, &oplock, &fileHandle, xid);
      ...
        return rc;
}

```

This routine is used to create an CIFS entry and the above code snippet is a check that will ensure ‘tcon->unix\_ext’ (this is a Boolean flag for Linux extensions to CIFS protocol) isn’t NULL and then proceed to a capabilities check using session’s stored capabilities (through ‘tcon->ses->capabilities’) as well as the UNIX extension filesystem’s capability (using ‘tcon->fsUnixInfo.Capability’). At last, it will call cifs\_posix\_open() of fs/cifs/dir.c but as it was noted by Eugene Teo, the provided code in cifs\_create() doesn’t perform any checks to ensure that the ‘nameidata’ pointer represented by ‘nd’ variable is a valid pointer. Because of this, if a file is created using UNIX extensions support and that file doesn’t provide any ‘nameidata’ pointer it will lead to ‘nd’ initialized to NULL and the call to cifs\_posix\_open() shown above will result in a NULL pointer dereference when it’ll attempt to access ‘nd->path.mnt’ to obtain the VFS mount information for that file. Here is how cifs\_posix\_open() uses the retrieved VFS mount structure (its 3rd argument):

```

int cifs_posix_open(char *full_path, struct inode **pinode,
                    struct vfsmount *mnt, int mode, int oflags,
                    __u32 *poplock, __u16 *pnetfid, int xid)
{
      ...
        struct cifs_sb_info *cifs_sb = CIFS_SB(mnt->mnt_sb);
      ...
        rc = CIFSPOSIXCreate(xid, cifs_sb->tcon, posix_flags, mode,
                        pnetfid, presp_data, poplock, full_path,
                        cifs_sb->local_nls, cifs_sb->mnt_cifs_flags &
                                        CIFS_MOUNT_MAP_SPECIAL_CHR);
      ...
        cifs_unix_basic_to_fattr(&fattr, presp_data, cifs_sb);

        /* get new inode and set it up */
        if (*pinode == NULL) {
                *pinode = cifs_iget(mnt->mnt_sb, &fattr);
      ...
        cifs_new_fileinfo(*pinode, *pnetfid, NULL, mnt, oflags);
      ...
        return rc;
}

```

Even though I haven’t tested anything yet I think that it could lead to exploitable conditions since it’s used by numerous functions that could be used to manipulate data from kernel space assuming that you can map the required pages to avoid the crash. Obviously, the vulnerability was patched simply like this:

```

 		oflags = FMODE_READ;

-	if (tcon->unix_ext && (tcon->ses->capabilities & CAP_UNIX) &&
+	if (nd && tcon->unix_ext && (tcon->ses->capabilities & CAP_UNIX) &&
 	    (CIFS_UNIX_POSIX_PATH_OPS_CAP &
 			le64_to_cpu(tcon->fsUnixInfo.Capability))) {

```

The code that introduced this is upstream commit c3b2a0c6. Any kernel
version from v2.6.29-rc6 onwards are affected.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
