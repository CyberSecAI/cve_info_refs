| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c0)  Martin Pitt    2010-04-06 09:32:12 UTC  ``` Original bug: <http://bugs.debian.org/576687>   udisks exports the device-mapper table data to udev. This data includes encryption keys.  | E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_COUNT=1 | E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE=crypt | E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_START=0 | E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_LENGTH=1467585 | E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\x20XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\x200\x208:5\x200  UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS includes the complete table entry, in case of the crypt target this includes the key and iv type.   udisks only needs UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS for UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE == "linear", and is only interested in the major/minor of the device and the offset.  So we should drop the key information for UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE == "crypt" or only explicitly set major/minor/offset, and/or not set UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE for anything != "linear". ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c1)  Martin Pitt    2010-04-06 11:36:10 UTC  ``` I committed a test for this, which fails right now:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/udisks/commit/?id=4670d2edfb615af94bd9d82d8fd12b7cf8d23b9d>  ====================================================================== FAIL: LUKS create/teardown ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Traceback (most recent call last):   File "tests/run", line 735, in test_0_create_teardown     self.failIf('essiv:sha' in out, 'key information in udev properties') AssertionError: key information in udev properties ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c2)  David Zeuthen (not reading bugmail)    2010-04-06 12:58:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c0)) > So we should drop the key information for UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE == "crypt" or > only explicitly set major/minor/offset, and/or not set UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE > for anything != "linear".  How about just keeping it for linear mappings for the time being? In the future we can keep it for other device mapper targets as well - for example, we want this data for multipath in order to display state about each path etc. etc. etc. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c3)  Martin Pitt    2010-04-06 14:08:09 UTC  ``` Before I go and touch any code, I added a new test case which exercises this code path by ensuring that DM partitions (kpartx'ed on a LV) have a correct PartitionSlave property (it involves parsing UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS and various DM_* properties). When I disable the UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS reading in udisks-part-id, this test case fails. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c4)  Martin Pitt    2010-04-06 14:08:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c2)) > How about just keeping it for linear mappings for the time being?  Works for me. Now that I have test cases for both ends, I'll work on that tomorrow (bedtime now).  Thanks! ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c5)  Martin Pitt    2010-04-06 23:16:27 UTC  ``` <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/udisks/commit/?id=0fcc7cb3b66f23fac53ae08647aa0007a2bd56c4> ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c6)  Martin Pitt    2010-04-07 08:06:42 UTC  ``` David, I think it's worth pushing out an 1.0.1 with this fix (I also made a couple of other fixes in trunk). Or do you want to wait for the CVE to arrive? (Someone requested one, as far as I understood from #udev). ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=27494#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2010-04-07 19:01:52 UTC  ``` From: 	Josh Bressers   	4/7/10 7:08 PM 	  	 Re: [oss-security] CVE Request -- udisks v1.0.0 -- (serious)information disclosure Please use CVE-2010-1149 for this.

Bug 27494 — publicly exports dm key informationChange udisks-dm-export to only export UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_PARAMS for "linear"
types. It is the only one we care about for now and know how to interpret.
"crypto" types have information about the encryption key in the target
parameters, which we must not leak.
Also add appropriate comments to the two places which currently evaluate
UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_PARAMS.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: udisks

udisks exports the device-mapper table data to udev. This data includes encryption keys.

| E:UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_COUNT=1

| E:UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_TYPE=crypt

| E:UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_START=0

| E:UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_LENGTH=1467585

| E:UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_PARAMS=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\x20XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\x200\x208:5\x200

UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_PARAMS includes the complete table entry, in case of the crypt target this includes the key and iv type.

How about just keeping it for linear mappings for the time being? In the future we can keep it for other device mapper targets as well - for example, we want this data for multipath in order to display state about each path etc. etc. etc.

Before I go and touch any code, I added a new test case which exercises this code path by ensuring that DM partitions (kpartx'ed on a LV) have a correct PartitionSlave property (it involves parsing UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_PARAMS and various DM\_\* properties). When I disable the UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_PARAMS reading in udisks-part-id, this test case fails.

Works for me. Now that I have test cases for both ends, I'll work on that tomorrow (bedtime now).

Thanks!

udisks only needs UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_PARAMS for UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_TYPE == "linear", and is only interested in the major/minor of the device and the offset.

So we should drop the key information for UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_TYPE == "crypt" or only explicitly set major/minor/offset, and/or not set UDISKS\_DM\_TARGETS\_TYPE for anything != "linear".

David, I think it's worth pushing out an 1.0.1 with this fix (I also made a couple of other fixes in trunk). Or do you want to wait for the CVE to arrive? (Someone requested one, as far as I understood from #udev).

This also affects devicekit-disks in karmic. Earlier Ubuntu releases used hal and did not have {u,dk}-disks yet.

Ah, \*phew\*, I checked karmic, and its dk-disks version is old enough to not yet export TARGETS\_PARAMS at all. ./src/devkit-disks-dm-export.c just entirely ignores the "params" return value.

Be careful : with the new update of udisks version 1.0.1-1ubuntu it is impossible to read an internal or usb floppy. The solution is to downgrade udisks to 1.0.1-build1 as I explain here in detail :

Hi Bastian,

looking at the source code of udisks-dm-export.c, I see that the following
variables are exported to udev:

UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_COUNT, UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE, UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_START,
UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_LENGTH, UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS.

In which of those variables is the "table data" exported? I don't see anything
suspicious there.
Am I looking at the wrong place? If so, could you please explain in more detail
where the problem is.

Thanks,
Michael

According to the udev db, the following is exported:

| E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_COUNT=1
| E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE=crypt
| E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_START=0
| E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_LENGTH=1467585
| E:UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\x20XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\x200\x208:5\x200

UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS includes the complete table entry, in case of
the crypt target this includes the key and iv type.

Package: udisks
Version: 1.0.0-1+b1
Severity: critical

The udev data is viewable by all users by running:

	/sbin/udevadm info --query=all --name=mapper/sdb4_crypt

Not only that, it is written to a a+r file /dev/.udev/db/block:dm-1,
which is THANKFULLY on a tmpfs.

So anyone on the system who can read files can read encryption keys.

Hi.

What did this exactly mean? Than any normal user on the system was able to
read the cleartext dmcrypt keys?
How can udisk know of them? Shouldn't they be just in kernel memory?
What's if I use LUKS?

Thanks,
Chris.
