Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `udisks-dm-export.c` component in `udisks`, which was exporting device-mapper table data, including encryption keys, to udev. Specifically, the `UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS` variable, when the `UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_TYPE` was "crypt," contained the encryption key and IV type. This information was unnecessarily exported, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information, specifically encryption keys used in device-mapper (DM) crypto targets, was being exposed to local users.
*   **Unnecessary Export:** `udisks` was exporting device-mapper parameters for "crypt" types when it only required the parameters for "linear" types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A local attacker could leverage this vulnerability to obtain encryption keys associated with encrypted storage devices.
*   **Data Compromise:** With the encryption keys, an attacker could potentially decrypt and access the contents of encrypted storage devices, leading to a full compromise of the data.
*   **Bypass Security Measures:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the encryption protection that should be provided by LUKS or similar technologies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **udev Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the udev interface, specifically by accessing the exported device-mapper properties.
*   **udevadm Command:** An attacker could use the `udevadm info --query=all --name=mapper/sdb4_crypt` command to view the exposed keys.
*   **File Access:** Alternatively, an attacker could directly read the `/dev/.udev/db/block:dm-1` file where udev stores the exported information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `udisks` is running.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:** Requires a basic understanding of Linux, udev, and device-mapper.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `udisks` versions prior to 1.0.1.
*   The fix involved modifying `udisks-dm-export.c` to only export `UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS` for "linear" target types and not for "crypt" types.
*   The exposed data was written to a file with world-readable permissions in `/dev/.udev/db/`, highlighting that the vulnerability could be exploited without needing root privileges.
*   The issue was also present in `devicekit-disks`, although the affected version did not export `TARGETS_PARAMS` and hence, wasn't exploitable.

The provided information suggests that the vulnerability was actively exploited and fixed. The fix was deployed in `udisks` version 1.0.1 and was also backported to several affected distributions.
