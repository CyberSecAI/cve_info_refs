  Linux Kernel <= 2.6.34-rc3 ReiserFS xattr Privilege Escalation
  Jon Oberheide <jon@oberheide.org>
  http://jon.oberheide.org

  Information:

    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=568041

    The kernel allows processes to access the internal ".reiserfs_priv"
    directory at the top of a reiserfs filesystem which is used to store
    xattrs. Permissions are not enforced in that tree, so unprivileged
    users can view and potentially modify the xattrs on arbitrary files.

  Usage:

    $ python team-edward.py
    [+] checking for reiserfs mount with user_xattr mount option
    [+] checking for private xattrs directory at /.reiserfs_priv/xattrs
    [+] preparing shell in /tmp
    [+] capturing pre-shell snapshot of private xattrs directory
    [+] compiling shell in /tmp
    [+] setting dummy xattr to get reiserfs object id
    [+] capturing post-shell snapshot of private xattrs directory
    [+] found 1 new object ids
    [+] setting cap_setuid/cap_setgid capabilities on object id 192B.1468
    [+] spawning setuid shell...
    # id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=4(adm), ...

  Notes:

    Obviously requires a ReiserFS filesystem mounted with extended attributes.
    Tested on Ubuntu Jaunty 9.10.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c0)  Matt McCutchen    2010-02-24 16:37:03 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The kernel allows processes to access the internal ".reiserfs_priv" directory at the top of a reiserfs filesystem which is used to store xattrs.  Permissions are not enforced in that tree, so unprivileged users can view and potentially modify the xattrs on arbitrary files.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-2.6.31.12-174.2.22.fc12.x86_64  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce:  As root: truncate --size 64M test.reiserfs mkreiserfs -f test.reiserfs mkdir /mnt/test mount -o loop,rw,user_xattr test.reiserfs /mnt/test setfattr -n user.test -v myvalue /mnt/test  As an unprivileged user: ls -l /mnt/test/.reiserfs_priv/xattrs/2.0 rm /mnt/test/.reiserfs_priv/xattrs/2.0/user.test  # Whoops  Actual results: The unprivileged user can read and write to /mnt/test/.reiserfs_priv .  Expected results: All processes are denied access to /mnt/test/.reiserfs_priv .  Additional info: I tested with SELinux completely disabled; I don't know if that makes a difference.  I don't know when the problem started.  For comparison, when I booted to a Fedora 10 live image, the kernel correctly blocked access to .reiserfs_priv .   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c4)  Kyle McMartin    2010-03-02 00:54:04 UTC  ``` -rwx------ 1 root root 15 2010-03-01 19:52 user.test kyle@phobos /mnt/test $ rm .reiserfs_priv/xattrs/2.0/user.test  kyle@phobos /mnt/test $   Looks like reiserfs xattr_unlink is missing a call to may_delete like vfs_unlink has. :/   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c5)  Matt McCutchen    2010-03-02 01:10:46 UTC  ``` Odd, I received an email with [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c4) but cannot see the comment here.  Red Hat folks, is it really necessary to keep your comments private?  Are you actually discussing embargoed security issues other than this one?  Anyway...  (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c4)) > -rwx------ 1 root root 15 2010-03-01 19:52 user.test > kyle@phobos /mnt/test $ rm .reiserfs_priv/xattrs/2.0/user.test  > kyle@phobos /mnt/test $ > > Looks like reiserfs xattr_unlink is missing a call to may_delete like > vfs_unlink has. :/  Rather, permissions are not checked under /.reiserfs_priv because that tree is supposed to be accessed only by internal filesystem code, after permission checking has been done elsewhere.  See:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=fs/reiserfs/xattr.c;h=81f09fab8ae476ccbdb9547d226e397e1b8cb6d1;hb=HEAD#l960>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c6)  Kyle McMartin    2010-03-02 01:24:27 UTC  ``` Sorry, yeah, accidentally clicked the private thing. Fixed. It's a private bug for now anyway, so only the security guys, you, and people on the CC list can see it atm.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c7)  Kyle McMartin    2010-03-02 02:57:18 UTC  ``` Ugh, reiserfs is a kludgy mess. I *think* what we want to do is check permissions during namei.c::reiserfs_lookup when checking IS_PRIVATE, and fail with -EACCES there if an ordinary user is attempting to bugger with the .reiserfs_priv dir. That should avoid screwing with the other proper xattr entrypoints.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c8)  Matt McCutchen    2010-03-02 03:10:05 UTC  ``` This worked as recently as the Fedora 10 live CD.  It might be worth understanding how the access check previously worked.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c9)  Kyle McMartin    2010-03-02 03:31:52 UTC  ``` Yeah, I can see where it's broken (I think) but not how to rectify the breakage with the changes in the privroot handling. We'll see what Al says. I'm not really a filesystem person.  regards, Kyle   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c10)  Kyle McMartin    2010-03-02 04:48:00 UTC  ``` Ok, I think I've puzzled out the bit that needs fixing. Reverting the bits that allow _lookup to succeed on the privroot fixes the issue in my testing.  <http://bombadil.infradead.org/~kyle/fix-reiserfs-xattrs.patch>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c11)  Matt McCutchen    2010-03-11 08:39:25 UTC  ``` My analysis: xattr_lookup_poison is commented "This will catch lookups from the fs root to .reiserfs_priv", but all it actually does is prevent lookups from matching the dentry structure held in REISERFS_SB(s)->priv_root.  So such lookups will just create a second dentry structure for .reiserfs_priv from the same dentry on disk!  IIUC, the dentry structures for each directory are maintained in a hash table in its parent's dentry structure, so two parallel trees of dentry structures would result.  This would explain the gross inconsistencies I saw when manipulating the privroot manually and running getfattr/setfattr at the same time.  The patch looks right to me.  IIUC, we still need xattr_lookup_poison to prevent a lookup from matching REISERFS_SB(s)->priv_root via the cache before it even gets to reiserfs_lookup.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c14)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-11 09:18:39 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5 or Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as they do not include support for reiserfs.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c15)  Matt McCutchen    2010-03-23 18:50:38 UTC  ``` I reported this to team.org .  Adding Dann Frazier from the Debian security team so he can see the full discussion.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c16)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-03-24 00:32:34 UTC  ``` Kyle, any progress on this one?   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c17)  Matt McCutchen    2010-04-01 21:26:25 UTC  ``` Reported to CERT/CC (<http://www.cert.org/>), report ID VRF#G7I2H94M .   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c18)  Ric Wheeler    2010-04-02 11:35:27 UTC  ``` Edward is our local reiserfs expert - Edward, any suggestions about how to fix this for Fedora?   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c19)  Matt McCutchen    2010-04-02 16:55:16 UTC  ``` There is a proposed patch linked in [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c10), which I believe is correct but could use additional review.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c20)  Edward Shishkin    2010-04-02 17:29:08 UTC  ``` I've asked Jeff Mahoney, the maintainer, to reconsider this commit (677c9b2e393a0cd203bd54e9c18b012b2c73305a). The patch in [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c10) looks good to me and I would recommend it as a temporal fixup.  Thanks to everyone. Edward.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c24)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-04-05 01:31:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c22)) > Yes, please share with as many vendors as you like so this issue can be fixed > and disclosed without further delay!      Matt, please informed CERT/CC that this has been assigned with [CVE-2010-1146](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1146). This issue will be public once the official fix is committed in the upstream kernel.  Edward, please update this bug when commit 677c9b2e3 is reconsidered. Also, please let us know when the fix is committed upstream, so that I can update other vendors. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c25)  Matt McCutchen    2010-04-05 01:50:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c24)) > Matt, please informed CERT/CC that this has been assigned with [CVE-2010-1146](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1146).  I have done so.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c26)  Edward Shishkin    2010-04-08 22:10:59 UTC  ``` Hello everyone.  Jeff Mahoney suggested his own version of the fixup: <http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=127076012022155&w=2>  I've ack-ed this: I think in Jeff's version permissions are checked more gracefully. At least reiserfs_lookup is critical function, and it is important to keep it light-weight.  Thanks, Edward.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c27)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-04-09 03:08:44 UTC  ``` Considering this public: <http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=127076012022155&w=2>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c31)  Edward Shishkin    2010-04-26 22:32:47 UTC  ``` The patch has been pushed to the upstream: commit cac36f707119b792b2396aed371d6b5cdc194890  Thanks, Edward.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c32)  Chuck Ebbert    2010-04-27 12:11:22 UTC  ``` Fixed in 2.6.32.12-112   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c33)  Fedora Update System    2010-04-28 04:35:21 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.32.12-114.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/kernel-2.6.32.12-114.fc12>   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c34)  Fedora Update System    2010-05-17 05:49:45 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.32.12-115.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/kernel-2.6.32.12-115.fc12>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=568041#c35)  Fedora Update System    2010-05-18 21:58:39 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.32.12-115.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.
