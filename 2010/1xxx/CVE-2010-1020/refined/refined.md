This document provides a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party TYPO3 extensions.

**Vulnerabilities and Affected Extensions:**

The advisory lists multiple TYPO3 extensions with the following vulnerabilities:

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Brainstorming (brainstorming)
    *   Educator (educator)
    *   Diocese of Portsmouth Database (pd\_diocesedatabase)
    *   SAV Filter Alphabetic (sav\_filter\_abc)
    *   SAV Filter Selectors (sav\_filter\_selectors)
    *   SAV Filter Months (sav\_filter\_months)
    *   Simple Gallery (sk\_simplegallery)
    *   TGM-Newsletter (tgm\_newsletter)
    *  YATSE - Yet another TYPO3 search engine (yatse)

*  **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *  MK Wastebasket (mk\_wastebasket)
    *  CleanDB (nf\_cleandb)
    *  CleanDB - DBAL (tmsw\_cleandb)
    *  Meet Travelmates (travelmate)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Sellector.com Widget Integration (chsellector)
    *   myDashboard (mydashboard)
    *   Reports Logfile View (reports\_logview)
    *   Simple Gallery (sk\_simplegallery)
    *   Typo3 Quixplorer (t3quixplorer)
    *    UserTask Center, recent (taskcenter\_recent)
    *   TGM-Newsletter (tgm\_newsletter)
    *  YATSE - Yet another TYPO3 search engine (yatse)
*   **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   TYPO3 Security - Salted user password hashes (t3sec\_saltedpw)
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Power Extension Manager (ch\_lightem)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete database information. In some cases, this could lead to complete compromise of the system by gaining access to administrative credentials.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Similar to SQL Injection but the attacker doesn't get direct feedback, making exploitation more challenging but still possible to extract data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
*  **Authentication Bypass:** Allows attackers to bypass the authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
*  **Information Disclosure**: Allows attackers to gain sensitive information about the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are in third-party TYPO3 extensions, meaning that the attack vectors depend on the specific vulnerabilities in each extension. Typically, this would involve sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance. In some cases, this may require the attacker to be authenticated, but some vulnerabilities can be exploited anonymously.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Uninstall Vulnerable Extensions:** For extensions with no available updates, the recommendation is to uninstall and delete the extension from the TYPO3 installation.
*   **Update Extensions:** For extensions with available updates, users are urged to update to the latest versions as soon as possible.
*   **Security Cookbook:** The advisory recommends following the guidelines in the TYPO3 Security Cookbook.
*   **Subscribe to Mailing List:** Users are advised to subscribe to the `typo3-announce` mailing list for future security bulletins.
*   **Collective Security Bulletin:** This advisory is a "Collective Security Bulletin," meaning that it groups multiple vulnerabilities in less important extensions, allowing the TYPO3 Security Team to focus on more critical issues.
