Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1057

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) issue in the Ad Board Script 1.01. The script uses a `require` statement in `codelib/cfg/common.inc.php` that includes a file based on the user-controlled `LANG_CODE` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include local files by manipulating the `LANG_CODE` parameter, using directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..//`) and null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass filename restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read any file on the server's filesystem that the web server user has permission to access.  This can expose sensitive information like configuration files, database credentials, or source code.
- **Potential for further attacks**: By reading configuration files, the attacker may be able to glean additional information to perform further attacks such as remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request targeting the vulnerable PHP scripts using the `LANG_CODE` parameter. The `LANG_CODE` parameter is modified to include directory traversal sequences and null byte injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic understanding of directory traversal and null byte injection:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `LANG_CODE` parameter using special sequences such as `../` and `%00`.
- **No authentication required:** The provided exploit examples do not suggest that authentication is required to exploit the LFI vulnerability.

**Exploit Examples:**
The exploit database provides multiple exploit examples:
   ```
    xpl:/path/web/codelib/cfg/common.inc.php?LANG_CODE=..//..//..//..//boot.ini%00 and /etc/passwd%00
    xpl:/path/web/codelib/sys/common.inc.php?LANG_CODE=..//..//..//..//boot.ini%00 and /etc/passwd%00
    xpl:/path/web/staff/common.inc.php?LANG_CODE=..//..//..//..//boot.ini%00 and /etc/passwd%00
    xpl:/path/web/staff/file.php?LANG_CODE=..//..//..//..//boot.ini%00 and /etc/passwd%00
    xpl:/path/web/staff/app/common.inc.php?LANG_CODE=..//..//..//..//boot.ini%00 and /etc/passwd%00
    ```

These examples demonstrate how an attacker can use directory traversal and null byte injection to read the `boot.ini` file, and `passwd` file, which is a typical target for demonstrating LFI exploits.
