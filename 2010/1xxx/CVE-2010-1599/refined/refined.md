```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id_sp` parameter within the `loadorder.php` script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as admin credentials (id, username, password), potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `loadorder.php` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `id_sp` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques."
