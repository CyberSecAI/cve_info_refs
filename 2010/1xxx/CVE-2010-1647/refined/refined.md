Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1647 (though not explicitly mentioned, the provided content describes the vulnerability associated with the fix in MediaWiki 1.15.4 and 1.16.0beta3)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from inconsistent CSS parsing between MediaWiki and Internet Explorer. Specifically, Internet Explorer's non-compliant handling of CSS escape sequences, particularly hexadecimal escape sequences (e.g., `\72`), leads to a discrepancy in how CSS strings are interpreted.
- Internet Explorer incorrectly uses a platform-dependent function (`iswspace()`) to determine whitespace characters at the end of a hexadecimal escape sequence, which includes more characters than the standard ASCII whitespace characters specified in CSS 2.0. This allows for the construction of CSS strings that are considered safe by MediaWiki but are decoded to unsafe strings containing JavaScript execution via `expression()` in Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, triggered by the difference in CSS parsing. Attackers can craft malicious CSS that executes arbitrary JavaScript within the context of a user's browser (specifically, Internet Explorer).
- **Inconsistent CSS Parsing:** The root cause is the non-standard parsing of CSS escape sequences in Internet Explorer compared to MediaWiki's parser and the CSS standard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when they view a page with the malicious CSS.
- **Compromise of User Accounts:** This can lead to various attacks including session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions, potentially leading to complete account takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious CSS Injection:** The attack vector is injecting crafted CSS strings into areas of a MediaWiki installation where user-supplied CSS is rendered. This could be through user profiles, custom pages, or other input fields that allow CSS input.
- **Internet Explorer Clients:** This vulnerability only impacts users viewing the MediaWiki installation through Internet Explorer clients.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject CSS:** The attacker needs the ability to inject CSS into a MediaWiki page. This often requires access to editable parts of the wiki or exploiting other vulnerabilities to achieve this injection.
- **Targeted Internet Explorer Users:** The vulnerability is specific to Internet Explorer. The attacker must target users browsing with Internet Explorer for the exploit to be effective.

**Mitigation:**
- The fix implemented normalizes CSS escape sequences to ensure consistent interpretation across both compliant browsers and Internet Explorer by replacing unnecessary escape sequences with literal characters, and terminating remaining escape sequences with an ASCII space.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug report provides a specific example: a sequence like `u\72<U+3000>l(...)` would be interpreted as `ur<U+3000>l(...)` by MediaWiki 1.15.3, but as `url(...)` by Internet Explorer due to its incorrect interpretation of the whitespace character `<U+3000>`. This highlights the character encoding and whitespace misinterpretation flaw.
