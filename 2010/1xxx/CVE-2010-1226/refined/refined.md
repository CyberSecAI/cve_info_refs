- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a malformed character being rendered by the iPhone's Springboard. Specifically, a sequence of bytes `\x4e\x5b\x01` is used, which, when repeated many times, causes a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition triggered by the processing of a malformed character string. The issue appears to be within the string handling or rendering mechanisms within the Springboard or related components.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to the crashing of Safari, Mail, and Springboard applications on the vulnerable iPhone devices, effectively denying the user access to those applications.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a webpage that contains malicious Javascript that generates a long malformed character string and uses it as HTML content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to host a webpage containing the malicious JavaScript code that, when visited by a vulnerable iPhone user, will trigger the crash. This can be achieved by hosting the malicious content on a web server and convincing the victim to visit the site.

The exploit works by creating an HTML page with Javascript code that generates a long string of the malformed character sequence and inserts it into the innerHTML of a div element. When this page is loaded in Safari on a vulnerable device, it causes the applications mentioned to crash.
