  "CVE-2010-1651": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "This CVE is associated with IBM WebSphere Application Server, where sensitive information can be exposed through SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) logging when Basic authentication is used and full SIP tracing is enabled. The server writes the entire SIP message, including header fields and the message body, to the trace file in cleartext.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposure of sensitive information in trace logs due to insufficient filtering of SIP message details.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Sensitive data within SIP messages, such as instant messages or other content, can be exposed to anyone who has access to the server's trace log files. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to the server's trace log files can view the exposed sensitive information.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs access to the server's trace log files. The vulnerability is present when full SIP tracing is enabled and Basic authentication is in use."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities fixed in WebSphere Application Server V6.1 and V7.0. This includes a vulnerability related to the TLS/SSL protocol and  CVE-2010-0434/CVE-2010-0408 and  CVE-2010-0425.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple security flaws, including issues related to TLS/SSL, link injection, and various code defects in WebSphere Application Server.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Vulnerabilities can result in information disclosure, potential link injection attacks, and general application malfunctions.",
        "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks exploiting weaknesses in the server and the ability to inject malicious links.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to exploit the specific flaws detailed in the APARs. Access varies based on the vulnerability. "
