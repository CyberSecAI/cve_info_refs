3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# Advisory Details

June 8th, 2010
## Apple Webkit ConditionEventListener Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-100ZDI-CAN-704

| CVE ID | [CVE-2010-1402](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1402) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Apple](http://www.apple.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['9873']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple's Webkit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within how the application duplicates event listeners in .svg documents. Upon creating an AnimateTransform object, the library will create a timer to handle the transformation and duplicate the object's event listener into Webkit's "shadow tree" of the image. Upon destruction of the shadow tree and the original tree, the application will destroy the Element containing the event listener twice. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4196> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-02-18 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-06-08 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

  Impact: A maliciously crafted URL may be obfuscated, making phishing attacks more effective

  Description: Safari supports the inclusion of user information in URLs, which allows the URL to specify a username and password to authenticate the user to the named server. These URLs are often used to confuse users, which can potentially aid phishing attacks. Safari is updated to display a warning before navigating to an HTTP or HTTPS URL containing user information. Credit to Abhishek Arya of Google, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1723

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: A maliciously crafted website may control the displayed website URL while a certificate warning is displayed

  Description: When Safari reaches a website via a 302 redirection and a certificate warning is displayed, the URL bar will contain the original website URL instead of the current website URL. This may allow a maliciously crafted website that is reached via an open redirector on a user-trusted website to control the displayed website URL while a certificate warning is displayed. This issue is addressed by returning the correct URL in the underlying CFNetwork layer. Credit to Kevin Day of Your.Org, and Jason Mueller of Indiana University for reporting this issue.

* **Settings**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1756

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in unexpected actions on other websites

  Description: An issue exists in WebKit's implementation of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Before allowing a page from one origin to access a resource in another origin, WebKit sends a preflight request to the latter server for access to the resource. WebKit includes custom HTTP headers specified by the requesting page in the preflight request. This can facilitate cross-site request forgery. This issue is addressed by removing custom HTTP headers from preflight requests. Credit: Apple.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0544

  Available for: iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
