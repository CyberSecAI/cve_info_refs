Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `UNINSTALL PLUGIN` command in MySQL did not perform any privilege checks before removing a plugin. This allowed any user, including those without any privileges, to uninstall any dynamically loaded plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness was the lack of privilege checking in the `mysql_uninstall_plugin()` function. This bypassed the intended security mechanism that limits plugin management to authorized users.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:**  The default behavior allowed unprivileged users to perform a privileged action, indicating an insecure default configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could uninstall critical plugins, potentially disrupting database functionality.
*   **Loss of Functionality:** Uninstalling plugins could lead to loss of features and/or data if the plugin was crucial for specific operations.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By uninstalling a security plugin an attacker could then perform malicious actions on the system without being detected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Any user with network access to the MySQL server could exploit this vulnerability by executing an `UNINSTALL PLUGIN` statement.
*   **Local Access:** A local user with access to a MySQL client could exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MySQL User Account:**  The attacker needed a valid user account with access to the MySQL server but did not require any specific privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Names:** The attacker needed to know the name of the plugin to uninstall it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check for the `DELETE` privilege on the `mysql.plugin` table before uninstalling a plugin, similar to the existing check for `INSTALL PLUGIN` which required `INSERT` privileges to the same table.
*   The fix was included in MySQL versions 5.1.46, 5.5.5, 6.0.14, and later versions.
*   The Ubuntu security notice USN-1397-1 includes CVE-2010-1621 as part of the multiple security issues fixed by the referenced MySQL version updates.
