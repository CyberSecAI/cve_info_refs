- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `offers_buy.php` script of the EC21 Clone 3.0 application due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `id` parameter in the URL, leading to the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as admin usernames and passwords, using the provided exploit string.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `offers_buy.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter of the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges on the server are needed to carry out the attack. The attacker needs to identify a vulnerable instance of the application and inject the SQL payload into the `id` parameter.
