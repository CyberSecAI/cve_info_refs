Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1249:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files. Specifically, the vulnerability exists due to how Excel handles the Excel file format, leading to memory corruption during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Corruption: The core weakness is a memory corruption issue that occurs when Excel processes a malformed file. This corruption can be exploited to gain control of the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- Full System Control: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Excel File: The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted, malicious Excel file.
- Email: Attackers can send the malicious file as an email attachment.
- Web-Based Attacks: Attackers can host the file on a website, and trick the user into downloading and opening it. This includes potentially compromised websites, or those accepting user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious Excel file.
- Ability to deliver the file to the victim, either via email or web based methods.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" because the user needs to open the malicious file for exploitation to occur, this mitigates the severity compared to an exploit that can occur with a single action from the user.
- Microsoft is not aware of any public exploits of this vulnerability as of the release of the security bulletin.
- Mitigation strategies include not opening untrusted Excel files, using the Office File Block Policy, and using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment.
