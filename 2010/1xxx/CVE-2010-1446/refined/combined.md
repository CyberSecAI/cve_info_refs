How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug(s)  : 573071

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4537

    Fabian Yamaguchi reported a missing check for Ethernet frames larger
    than the MTU in the r8169 driver. This may allow users on the local
    network to crash a system, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-0727

    Sachin Prabhu reported an issue in the GFS2 filesystem. Local users
    can trigger a BUG() altering the permissions on a locked file,
    resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1083

    Linus Torvalds reported an issue in the USB subsystem, which may allow
    local users to obtain portions of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-1084

    Neil Brown reported an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem that may
    permit remote attackers to overwrite memory through the creation
    of large numbers of sockets, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1086

    Ang Way Chuang reported an issue in the DVB subsystem for Digital
    TV adapters. By creating a specially-encoded MPEG2-TS frame, a remote
    attacker could cause the receiver to enter an endless loop, resulting
    in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1087

    Trond Myklebust reported an issue in the NFS filesystem. A local
    user may cause an oops by sending a fatal signal during a file
    truncation operation, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1088

    Al Viro reported an issue where automount symlinks may not
    be followed when LOOKUP_FOLLOW is not set. This has an unknown
    security impact.

CVE-2010-1162

    Catalin Marinas reported an issue in the tty subsystem that allows
    local attackers to cause a kernel memory leak, possibly resulting
    in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1173

    Chris Guo from Nokia China and Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva from
    Codenomicon Ltd reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that allows
    a remote attacker to cause a denial of service using a malformed init
    package.

CVE-2010-1187

    Neil Hormon reported an issue in the TIPC subsystem. Local users can
    cause a denial of service by way of a NULL pointer dereference by
    sending datagrams through AF_TIPC before entering network mode.

CVE-2010-1437

    Toshiyuki Okajima reported a race condition in the keyring subsystem.
    Local users can cause memory corruption via keyctl commands that
    access a keyring in the process of being deleted, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2010-1446

    Wufei reported an issue with kgdb on the PowerPC architecture,
    allowing local users to write to kernel memory. Note: this issue
    does not affect binary kernels provided by Debian. The fix is
    provided for the benefit of users who build their own kernels
    from Debian source.

CVE-2010-1451

"Note: While at it, I removed a non-sensical statement related to
CONFIG_KGDB in ppc_mmu_32.c which could cause kernel mappings to be user
accessible when that option is enabled. Probably something that bitrot."

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 GA Kernel was updated to 2.6.27.48 fixing
various bugs and security issues.
CVE-2010-1641: The do\_gfs2\_set\_flags function in fs/gfs2/file.c in the
Linux kernel does not verify the ownership of a file, which allows
local users to bypass intended access restrictions via a SETFLAGS
ioctl request.
CVE-2010-1087: The nfs\_wait\_on\_request function in fs/nfs/pagelist.c in
the Linux kernel allows attackers to cause a denial of service (Oops)
via unknown vectors related to truncating a file and an operation
that is not interruptible.
CVE-2010-1643: mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel, when strict overcommit
is enabled, does not properly handle the export of shmemfs objects
by knfsd, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and knfsd crash) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-1437: Race condition in the find\_keyring\_by\_name function
in security/keys/keyring.c in the Linux kernel allows local users
to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash)
or possibly have unspecified other impact via keyctl session commands
that trigger access to a dead keyring that is undergoing deletion by
the key\_cleanup function.
CVE-2010-1446: arch/1/mm/fsl\_booke\_mmu.c in KGDB in the Linux kernel,
when running on PowerPC, does not properly perform a security check
for access to a kernel page, which allows local users to overwrite
arbitrary kernel memory, related to Fsl booke.
CVE-2010-1162: The release\_one\_tty function in drivers/char/tty\_io.c in
the Linux kernel omits certain required calls to the put\_pid function,
which has unspecified impact and local attack vectors.
CVE-2009-4537: drivers/net/r8169.c in the r8169 driver in the Linux
kernel does not properly check the size of an Ethernet frame that
exceeds the MTU, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial
of service (temporary network outage) via a packet with a crafted size,
in conjunction with certain packets containing A characters and certain
packets containing E characters; or (2) cause a denial of service
(system crash) via a packet with a crafted size, in conjunction with
certain packets containing '0' characters, related to the value of the
status register and erroneous behavior associated with the RxMaxSize
register. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect
fix for CVE-2009-1389. Code execution might be possible.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Subject: CVE request - Linux Kernel KGDB/ppc issue

Hi All,

The problem is that if KGDB is enabled on a powerpc board, a
test that checks if a page is user or kernel is bypassed.
This means that a user can write to arbitrary kernel address space.

Upon further investigation, we found that kernels older than
the v2.6.30-rc1 release have the same problem for non-booke
ppc chips (74xx, 8641D), so we need two patches for kernels
up to that date, and then one patch for ones after that date.

Thanks,
Hui

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
