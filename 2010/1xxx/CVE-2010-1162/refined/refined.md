  "cveId": "CVE-2010-1162",
  "baseScore": "7.8",
  "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C",
  "description": "The `release_one_tty` function in `drivers/char/tty_io.c` in the Linux kernel omits certain required calls to the `put_pid` function, which has unspecified impact and local attack vectors.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `release_one_tty()` function in the Linux kernel's TTY subsystem fails to properly decrement the reference count of process IDs (PIDs) when releasing a TTY. Specifically it forgets to call the `put_pid()` function in certain code paths, leading to a memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper reference counting of PIDs in the `release_one_tty()` function."
     ],
    "impact": "A kernel memory leak occurs, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) if the leak continues, exhausting memory resources. The specific impact is described as 'unspecified', but potentially leads to a denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local attackers can trigger the vulnerability by exploiting the TTY subsystem and releasing a TTY in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path."
      ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker must have local access to the system and be able to interact with the TTY subsystem."
  },
  "affectedSystems": [
    "Linux kernel versions v2.6.26-rc1 and above are affected by this issue.",
        "Red Hat Enterprise MRG is affected.",
        "Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (lenny) is affected.",
        "openSUSE 11.1",
