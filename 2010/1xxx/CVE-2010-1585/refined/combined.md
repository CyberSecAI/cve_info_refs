The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-08

## ParanoidFragmentSink allows javascript: URLs in chrome documents

Announced
March 1, 2011
Reporter
Roberto Suggi Liverani
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.17
* Firefox 3.6.14
* SeaMonkey 2.0.12
* Thunderbird 3.1.8

### Description

Security researcher **Roberto Suggi Liverani**
reported that `ParanoidFragmentSink`, a class used to
sanitize potentially unsafe HTML for display,
allows `javascript:` URLs and other inline JavaScript when
the embedding document is a chrome document. While there are no
unsafe uses of this class in any released products, extension code
could have potentially used it in an unsafe manner.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=562547#c0)• 15 years ago |
|  | |

The two ns(X)HTMLParanoidFragmentSink classes are used by nsIScriptableUnescapeHTML to sanitize (X)HTML by stripping attributes and tags not on a built-in whitelist. Internally to Firefox this is only used by the feed processor, but it's fairly popular with add-on authors and recommended as a best-practice.
The sinks attempt to sanitize URLs by calling CheckLoadURI[...]DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL), but unfortunately when the target document is a chrome document (as is common with add-ons) this check allows any URI. In particular malicious href="javascript:evil()" or <iframe src="data:evil"> can slip through and create sg-critical bugs.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/c753325a40ff/content/html/document/src/nsHTMLFragmentContentSink.cpp#l967>
and ditto content/xml/document/src/nsXMLFragmentContentSink.cpp
Would it be OK to simply always pass a nsNullPrincipal in instead?
This problem was recently published in a whitepaper referenced at
<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/510883/100/0/threaded>

We really dropped the ball here, this is a critical security hole and should have been commited immediately, not 8 months (!) later.
I'd like to commit this NOW, so that it makes beta 8.
I also think it should be commited to stable branches, esp. considering Thunderbird 3.1.

It seems like DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL would forbid exactly that, and it would be most important to work in the case of chrome. There may be other code which wrongly relies on that. Did anybody search addons code and other thirdparty code?
<<http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=DISALLOW_INHERIT_PRINCIPAL>> shows a few other uses. Or am I misunderstanding the API?

This might have caused test failure [bug 619436](/show_bug.cgi?id=619436 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent failure in test_contextmenu.html | paste for command cmd_copyLink - got \"\", expected \"http://mozilla.com/\""), maybe also [bug 619437](/show_bug.cgi?id=619437 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent failure in test_bug166235.html and test_copypaste.html | uncaught exception in nsITransferable.getTransferData") and [bug 619438](/show_bug.cgi?id=619438 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent failure in test_clipboard_events.html | set/get clipboard text failed - got null, expected \"empty_0.5997034641081909\" followed by many other failures and libeditor clipboard test failures"). Please see [bug 619436](/show_bug.cgi?id=619436 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent failure in test_contextmenu.html | paste for command cmd_copyLink - got \"\", expected \"http://mozilla.com/\"") - I don't want to delude this security bug here with discussion about tests.
Particularly, I think we may need a more general fix here which fixes DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL to actually do what it says.

Fundamentally, using DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL is an abuse of what's a security check API. And chrome code should be able to pass any security check...
This bug, if it's fixed, should be resolved accordingly. If you think we should change the behavior of DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL for the system principal, that should be a separate bug.

|  | |

bz, I don't understand... The word DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL for me says: Ignore the passed in principal, do not use it to calculate the permissions. In other words, exactly what this patch did.
The description says: "Don't allow URLs which would inherit the caller's principal (such as javascript: or data:) to load." Here, javascript: URLs \*did\* load, directly violating what the flag promised.
Again, if I misunderstood something, please tell me where/why.

DISALLOW\_INHERIT\_PRINCIPAL was added to an existing security check which always returned "ok" for system principals. Perhaps the check should have been redefined in the process; I'm happy to have a separate bug on that. But why is THIS bug still open, given that the patch has landed? Why is the checkin-needed keyword still present? Why are the branch status flags indicating nothing has landed given that branch fixes have laded? Am \_I\_ misunderstanding something about the state of this bug?

> But why is THIS bug still open, given that the patch has landed?
Because I wanted this question to be resolved. As shown in the comments above, there are other third-party users of this flag, and they likely misunderstood this, too, in the same way.
From my point of view, this bug is not resolved until that flag behaves differently, but apparently you disagree, and that's fine.
Also, this bug may or may not have caused several test failures, specifically [bug 619436](/show_bug.cgi?id=619436 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Intermittent failure in test_contextmenu.html | paste for command cmd_copyLink - got \"\", expected \"http://mozilla.com/\""). Given that the failure is intermittent, I don't know what (and don't want) to do with it. I can't see a problem in the app.

firefox security and bug fix update (RHSA-2011-0310)

Original Release Date: April 11, 2011

Last Revised: February 5, 2013

Number: ASA-2011-093

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox sanitized HTML content in extensions.
If an extension loaded or rendered malicious content using the
ParanoidFragmentSink class, it could fail to safely display the content,
causing Firefox to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges of the
user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1585](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1585.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled dialog boxes. An attacker could
use this flaw to create a malicious web page that would present a blank
dialog box that has non-functioning buttons. If a user closes the dialog
box window, it could unexpectedly grant the malicious web page elevated
privileges.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0051](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0051.html) to this issue.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0053](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0053.html),
[CVE-2011-0055](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0055.html),
[CVE-2011-0058](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0058.html) and
[CVE-2011-0062](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0062.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox handled malformed JavaScript. A
website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox to execute that
JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0054](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0054.html),
[CVE-2011-0056](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0056.html) and
[CVE-2011-0057](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0057.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0061](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0061.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled plug-ins that perform HTTP
requests. If a plug-in performed an HTTP request, and the server sent a 307
redirect response, the plug-in was not notified, and the HTTP request was
forwarded. The forwarded request could contain custom headers, which could
result in a Cross Site Request Forgery attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0059](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0059.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0310.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Communication Server 1000: * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | 7.0 and 7.5 | None | See mitigating factors. | | Avaya IQ | 4.0.x through 5.1.x | None | See mitigating factors. | | Avaya Message Networking | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1 thru 6.1.2 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.3 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ System Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-1585 CVE-2011-0051 CVE-2011-0053 CVE-2011-0054 CVE-2011-0055 CVE-2011-0056 CVE-2011-0057 CVE-2011-0058 CVE-2011-0059 CVE-2011-0061 CVE-2011-0062 | These are a Low for MN, MSS, PS, SM and SMGR as it would require non-standrard direct user interaction. There is no risk to IQ and CS1000 as firefox is not installed, only xulrunner. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
