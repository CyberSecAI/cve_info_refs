    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing web pages
    - Phishing and other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through vulnerable parameters within the Movable Type administrative interface.
- This could potentially be achieved by crafting malicious URLs or manipulating other input fields used by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to identify the specific input parameters in the Movable Type CMS that are susceptible to XSS.
- **Ability to Inject Malicious Scripts:** The attacker must be able to craft and inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **User Interaction:** A user has to interact with the crafted malicious script by clicking a link, or viewing a manipulated web page.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Movable Type Open Source 5.0 and 5.01, and Movable Type 5.0 and 5.01 (including Professional and Community Packs).
- The vulnerability is different from other previously disclosed vulnerabilities in Movable Type.

**CVSS Metrics (from JVN):**
   - **Access Vector:** Network (can be attacked over the Internet)
   - **Authentication:** None required
   - **User Interaction:** Required (user must be convinced to take an action)
   - **Complexity:** Low
   - **Confidentiality Impact:** None
   - **Integrity Impact:** Partial
   - **Availability Impact:** None
   - **CVSS v2 Score:** 2.6 (Low)
