Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1999:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) issue in Opencatalogue version 1.024.
*   The vulnerability is located in the `soustab.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application improperly handles user-supplied input in the `dsn[phptype]` parameter within the `soustab.php` file, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files. The exploitation involves using a null byte (`%00`) to bypass file extension checks, if any.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read any file accessible by the web server, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, or other critical data. This can lead to a full compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `soustab.php` with the `dsn[phptype]` parameter set to a local file path followed by a null byte.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of target file paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path to files on the server to read them.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit is specific to `Opencatalogue 1.024` and is a web application vulnerability.
*   The exploit was discovered by "cr4wl3r" and is publicly available on Exploit-DB.
*   The proof-of-concept (PoC) provided is  `http://[site]/[path]/scr/soustab.php?dsn[phptype]=[LFI%00]`.
