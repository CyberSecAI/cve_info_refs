{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Moodle's backup and restore functionality did not properly check user creation capabilities during course restoration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient capability checks",
      "Incorrect privilege assignment during course restoration"
    ],
    "impact": "Teachers or course creators, who do not have the 'moodle/user:create' capability, could create user accounts by restoring a course backup that includes user accounts. This bypasses access control measures, potentially leading to unauthorized account creation, and the admin would not be aware of the unauthorized account creation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Course backup file",
      "Moodle course restore functionality"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a teacher or course creator within a Moodle instance and have access to a course backup file that contains user accounts."
