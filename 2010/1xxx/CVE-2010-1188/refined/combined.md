kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2010-0394 RHSA-2010-0424)

Original Release Date: June 21, 2010

Last Revised: March 26, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-146

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

\* RHSA-2009:1024 introduced a flaw in the ptrace implementation on Itanium
systems. ptrace\_check\_attach() was not called during certain ptrace()
requests. Under certain circumstances, a local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to call ptrace() on a process they do not own, giving them
control over that process. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-0729](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0729.html) to this issue.

\* a flaw was found in the kernel's Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
(ULE) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted ISO
MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) frame to a target system, resulting in a
denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1086](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1086.html) to this issue.

\* a use-after-free flaw was found in tcp\_rcv\_state\_process() in the
kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using IPv6 had
the IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote attacker
could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel panic.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1188](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1188.html) to this issue.

\* a divide-by-zero flaw was found in azx\_position\_ok() in the Intel High
Definition Audio driver, snd-hda-intel. A local, unprivileged user could
trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1085.html) to this issue.

\* an information leak flaw was found in the kernel's USB implementation.
Certain USB errors could result in an uninitialized kernel buffer being
sent to user-space. An attacker with physical access to a target system
could use this flaw to cause an information leak. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1083.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0394.html>

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0424.html>

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

Subject: CVE request: kernel: ipv6: skb is unexpectedly freed (remote DoS)

Upstream commit:
<http://git.kernel.org/linus/fb7e2399ec17f1004c0e0ccfd17439f8759ede01>

Description from the commit:
"The server side sets IPV6_RECVPKTINFO on a listening socket, and the
client side just sends a message to the server.  Then the kernel panic
occurs on the server.

This problem happens because a skb is forcibly freed in
tcp_rcv_state_process().

When a socket in listening state(TCP_LISTEN) receives a syn packet, then
tcp_v6_conn_request() will be called from tcp_rcv_state_process().  If
the tcp_v6_conn_request() successfully returns, the skb would be
discarded by __kfree_skb().

However, in case of a listening socket which was already set
IPV6_RECVPKTINFO, an address of the skb will be stored in treq->pktopts
and a ref count of the skb will be incremented in tcp_v6_conn_request().
  But, even if the skb is still in use, the skb will be freed.  Then
someone still using the freed skb will cause the kernel panic."

Triggering this could result in a general protection fault.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=577711>

Thanks, Eugene

c. Multiple vulnerabilities in mount.vmhgfs
This patch provides a fix for the following three security issues in the VMware Host Guest File System (HGFS). None of these issues affect Windows based Guest Operating Systems.

1. Mount.vmhgfs Information Disclosure Information disclosure via a vulnerability that allows an attacker with access to the Guest to determine if a path exists in the Host filesystem and whether it is a file or directory regardless of permissions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2011-2146 to this issue.
2. Mount.vmhgfs Race Condition Privilege escalation via a race condition that allows an attacker with access to the guest to mount on arbitrary directories in the Guest filesystem and achieve privilege escalation if they can control the contents of the mounted directory. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2011-1787 to this issue.
3. Mount.vmhgfs Privilege Escalation Privilege escalation via a procedural error that allows an attacker with access to the guest operating system to gain write access to an arbitrary file in the Guest filesystem. This issue only affects Solaris and FreeBSD Guest Operating Systems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2011-2145 to this issue.

VMware would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting theseissues.

VI Client COM objects can be instantiated in Internet Explorer which may cause memory corruption. An attacker who succeeded in making the VI Client user visit a malicious Web site could execute code on the user's system within the security context of that user.

VMware would like to thank Elazar Broad and iDefense for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2011-2217 to this issue.

Affected versions.

The vSphere Client which comes with vSphere 4.0 and vSphere 4.1 is not affected. This is any build of vSphere Client Version 4.0.0 and vSphere Client Version 4.1.0.

VI Clients bundled with VMware Infrastructure 3 that are not affected are:

* VI Client 2.0.2 Build 230598 and higher
* VI Client 2.5 Build 204931 and higher

The issue can be remediated by replacing an affected VI Client with the VI Client bundled with VirtualCenter 2.5 Update 6 or VirtualCenter 2.5 Update 6a.

[TCP]: skb is unexpectedly freed.I encountered a kernel panic with my test program, which is a very
simple IPv6 client-server program.
The server side sets IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO on a listening socket, and the
client side just sends a message to the server. Then the kernel panic
occurs on the server. (If you need the test program, please let me
know. I can provide it.)
This problem happens because a skb is forcibly freed in
tcp\_rcv\_state\_process().
When a socket in listening state(TCP\_LISTEN) receives a syn packet,
then tcp\_v6\_conn\_request() will be called from
tcp\_rcv\_state\_process(). If the tcp\_v6\_conn\_request() successfully
returns, the skb would be discarded by \_\_kfree\_skb().
However, in case of a listening socket which was already set
IPV6\_RECVPKTINFO, an address of the skb will be stored in
treq->pktopts and a ref count of the skb will be incremented in
tcp\_v6\_conn\_request(). But, even if the skb is still in use, the skb
will be freed. Then someone still using the freed skb will cause the
kernel panic.
I suggest to use kfree\_skb() instead of \_\_kfree\_skb().

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
