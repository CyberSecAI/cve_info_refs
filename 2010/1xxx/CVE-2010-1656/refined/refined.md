Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `com_abc` component for Joomla!

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query, specifically in the `sectionid` parameter within the `index.php?option=com_abc&view=abc&letter=AS` URL. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords. This is demonstrated by the exploit code which retrieves usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
- **Full Database Access:**  An attacker could potentially gain complete control over the database, depending on the database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with a specifically crafted SQL payload within the `sectionid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable component:** The attacker needs to know about the presence of the vulnerable `com_abc` component

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit code provided is written in Perl and demonstrates how to leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract user credentials.
- The vulnerable component is `com_abc` version 1.1.7.
- The vendor is identified as `http://www.airiny.com/`
