      "is_related": true,
      "vuln_description": "Consona (formerly SupportSoft) Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS) contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities stem from multiple weaknesses within the Consona Intelligent Assistance Suite (IAS).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) in `ns6plugindestructor.asp`",
        "Unsafe methods provided by the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`)",
        "Buffer overflow in the `SdcUser.TgConCtl` ActiveX control (`tgctlcm.dll`)",
        "Local privilege elevation in the Repair Service (`tgsrv.exe`) which is installed on Windows Vista and Windows 7."
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user, and potentially gain SYSTEM privileges through the Repair Service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email message).",
         "Exploitation of XSS to instantiate vulnerable ActiveX Control",
         "Leveraging unsafe ActiveX methods to download and execute arbitrary programs",
         "Abuse of the Repair Service for privilege escalation."

      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to interact with a malicious HTML document (e.g., via web page or email).",
        "additional_information": "The XSS vulnerability can be exploited to instantiate the SdcUser.TgConCtl control, which can then be leveraged to download and execute arbitrary programs via its unsafe methods. The Repair Service can elevate privileges from user (or Low-Rights IE) to SYSTEM."
