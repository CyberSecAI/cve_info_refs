{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The dynamic configuration feature in Xinha WYSIWYG editor 0.96 Beta 2 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper handling of backend_config_secret_key_location and backend_config_hash parameters used in a SHA1 hash of a shared secret.",
    "Improper handling of backend_data and backend_data[key_location] variables by the xinha_read_passed_data function."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can modify the configuration of arbitrary plugins, potentially leading to arbitrary file uploads and code execution, specifically through the ImageManager plugin's config.inc.php.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Crafting malicious backend_config_secret_key_location and backend_config_hash parameters.",
    "Crafting malicious backend_data and backend_data[key_location] variables."
  ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
