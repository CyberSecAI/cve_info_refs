Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the way Microsoft Office Word parses certain rich text data. Specifically, it fails to perform sufficient data validation when handling this type of data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the RTF parsing engine of Microsoft Office Word. This occurs when the application writes data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the local user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **E-mail:** An attacker could send a specially crafted RTF file as an email attachment or include it in the body of an email message. The user would need to preview or open the email (with Word as the viewer) to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker could host a website containing a malicious RTF file. They would then need to convince a user to visit the site and open the file. This may involve tricking the user into clicking a malicious link. Compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content could also be used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Crafted RTF File:** The attacker must have the ability to create a specially crafted RTF file that triggers the buffer overflow.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to open the malicious RTF file or preview an email containing the malicious RTF content. The attacker needs to convince the victim to perform this action either through email or by visiting a malicious website.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the way Word handles properties of rich text data.
- The Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-056 provides a detailed description of the vulnerability and lists affected software.
- The update addresses this vulnerability by modifying how Word handles the affected data, and how it opens specially crafted files.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin being released, and there were no reports of it being exploited in the wild before the patch.
