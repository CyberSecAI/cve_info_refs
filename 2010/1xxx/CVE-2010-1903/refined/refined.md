Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2010-1903:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Office Word handles a specially crafted Word file containing a malformed record related to HTML linked objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability that occurs when Word processes the malformed record within a Word file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Full System Control:** The attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    *   Install programs
    *   View, change, or delete data
    *   Create new user accounts with full administrative rights
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the user who opened the malicious file. Users with fewer rights on the system will be less affected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Attachment:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Word document as an email attachment. The user has to open the file to be exploited.
*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious Word file or include the malicious content on compromised websites. The attacker must convince a user to visit this site and open the malicious file.
*   **Instant Messaging:** Similar to the email vector, an attacker could use instant messaging to send a malicious Word document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting Malicious File:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Word document with a malformed record related to HTML linked objects.
*   **Social Engineering:** In email and web-based attacks, the attacker must rely on social engineering to convince the user to open the malicious file.
*   **Remote Access:** No specific physical access is required to conduct this attack as it can be done remotely.
