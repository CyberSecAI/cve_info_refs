# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-056 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Word Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2269638)

Published: August 10, 2010 | Updated: September 01, 2010

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens or previews a specially crafted RTF e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Office Word 2007. This security update is also rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office Word 2002, Microsoft Office Word 2003, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; Works 9; and all supported versions of Microsoft Office Word Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office Word opens specially crafted Word files and by modifying the way that Word handles certain properties of rich text data. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2269638](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2269638) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**How is Microsoft Office Outlook affected by these vulnerabilities?**

Outlook is not directly affected because the vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Office Word. However, if Word is the selected e-mail reader, which is the default case in Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, then an attacker could leverage Outlook for the e-mail attack vector by sending a specially crafted RTF e-mail message to the target user.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**What is the Microsoft Office Word Viewer?**

The Microsoft Office Word Viewer is a replacement for Word Viewer 2003 and all previous Word Viewer versions. With Word Viewer, you can view, print, and copy Word documents, even if you do not have Word installed. For more details about currently supported Office viewers, see [Supported versions of the Office viewers](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/979860/en-us).

**How are Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerability?**

An Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in an Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Office Word is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Office Word that was delivered with an Office Suite.

**The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## Word Record Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1900

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office Word handles malformed records inside a specially crafted Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-1900](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1900).

#### Mitigating Factors for Word Record Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1900

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Word file.

#### Workarounds for Word Record Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1900

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

## Word RTF Parsing Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1901

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office Word parses rich text data. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-1901](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1901).

#### Mitigating Factors for Word RTF Parsing Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1901

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Word RTF Parsing Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-1901

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Read e-mails in plain text**

  To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view in plain text only those e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of workaround.** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Word file with an affected version of Microsoft Office Word.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Word document to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Word file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Office Word is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Office Word opens specially crafted Word files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.
