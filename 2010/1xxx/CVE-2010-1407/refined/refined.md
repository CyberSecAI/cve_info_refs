{
  "cveId": "CVE-2010-1407",
  "description": "An information disclosure issue exists in WebKit's handling of the 'history.replaceState' method. Within an iframe, calls to replaceState affect the parent frame even if the parent is in a separate origin. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in an information disclosure. This issue is addressed by restricting the operation of replaceState calls to the current frame. Credit to Darin Fisher of Google Inc. for reporting this issue.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the way WebKit handles the 'history.replaceState' method within iframes, specifically when a call to 'replaceState' from an iframe affects the parent frame, even if they are from different origins.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-origin information disclosure vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Visiting a malicious website may lead to information disclosure by allowing a child frame to modify the history of parent frame, which is an unintended behavior.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Visiting a maliciously crafted website with a malicious iframe."
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker would need to host a webpage with an iframe that exploits the replaceState vulnerability.",
     "requiredPosition": "The attacker needs to have a user visit the malicious webpage."
  }
