    "content": "The provided content describes a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Openurgence vaccin 1.03. \n\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nThe vulnerability exists due to the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `path_om` parameter in multiple files and the `dsn[phptype]` parameter in `soustab.php`.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The `path_om` parameter in various PHP files (e.g., `collectivite.class.php`, `injection.class.php`, etc.) is vulnerable to RFI, allowing an attacker to include and execute arbitrary remote files. \n- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The `dsn[phptype]` parameter in `soustab.php` is vulnerable to LFI, enabling an attacker to include arbitrary local files by using null byte injection.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- RFI: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file, leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial-of-service. \n- LFI: An attacker can access sensitive files on the server's file system, which may contain credentials, configuration information, or other confidential data.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- HTTP GET requests with the vulnerable parameters (`path_om` for RFI and `dsn[phptype]` for LFI).\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. \n- For RFI, the attacker needs a web server to host the malicious remote file.",
