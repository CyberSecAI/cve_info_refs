Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2010-1958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Drupal FileField module not sanitizing image filenames before displaying them. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary script within the filename itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS. The module fails to properly encode or sanitize the filename before rendering it in the web page, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Script Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
- Potential Account Compromise: This can potentially lead to the compromise of administrative accounts and subsequently, the compromise of the web server process.
- Data Manipulation: Attackers might be able to perform actions as the victim user or steal cookies/session information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- File Upload: The attack vector involves uploading a file (e.g., a GIF image) with a malicious filename containing JavaScript code.
- Content Creation: An attacker needs to have the ability to create content that utilizes the vulnerable FileField module, which is used to upload files.
- File system setting must be set to "Public".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Content Creation Privileges: The attacker needs to have user rights to create content that employs a FileField CCK element.
- Public File System Setting: The Drupal file system must be configured to "Public", which is also the default setting.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Drupal 6.16 with CCK 6.x-2.6 and FileField 6.x-3.3
- The exploit consists of crafting a filename such as `<iframe src="index.php" onload="alert('xss')">.gif` and uploading it through a FileField. When this uploaded file is displayed, the browser interprets the filename as HTML and executes the JavaScript.
- The patch involves using `check_plain()` function when creating the file path and URL to sanitize the filename, preventing HTML and script injection.

**Patch Information:**
The provided patch indicates changes to the `filefield_formatter.inc` file to sanitize the filepath using `check_plain()` function before it is used to create a path or url to the file:
