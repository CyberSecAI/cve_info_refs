Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-1553:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `getnnmdata.exe` CGI script of HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM).
*   Specifically, the issue is within a `sprintf()` call made when handling an invalid `MaxAge` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A critical flaw exists where the `sprintf()` function copies data into a fixed-length stack buffer without performing any length checks on the input `MaxAge` parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the length of the `MaxAge` parameter, allowing an attacker to supply an overly long string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By providing a malicious `MaxAge` parameter, an attacker can overwrite the stack buffer and execute arbitrary code on the server. This code will execute with the privileges of the webserver process.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code could lead to a complete compromise of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request targeting the `getnnmdata.exe` CGI script.
*   **`MaxAge` Parameter:** The malicious payload is embedded within the `MaxAge` parameter of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable HP OpenView Network Node Manager instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to trigger this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable CGI:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `getnnmdata.exe` CGI.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) versions 7.01, 7.51, and 7.53.
*   The CVSS base score is 10.0, which is the highest criticality rating.
*   The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher working with the TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative.
*   HP has released patches to address this issue.
