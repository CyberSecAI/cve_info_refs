Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles the `CStyleSheet` object.
- When a stylesheet array is created, it holds a reference to its root container.
- If the stylesheet is created as part of an element not in the markup, the root container can be freed when that element is destroyed.
- Subsequently, when the application attempts to use the stylesheet, it accesses an invalid pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to use-after-free condition.
- Dereferencing an invalid pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system under the context of the user running the browser.
- An attacker could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a specially crafted web page.
- An attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious page, typically by using links in emails or instant messages, or through compromised websites.
- The exploit can also be triggered via an ActiveX control embedded in an application or document that hosts the IE rendering engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerability.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious web page (e.g., through social engineering).
- No special privileges or access are required on the target system.
