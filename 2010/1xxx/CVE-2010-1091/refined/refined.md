Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The phpMySite application contains two distinct vulnerabilities:

1.  **SQL Injection:** This vulnerability is located in the `index.php` file. It is triggered by the `action` GET parameter, which is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability exists in the `contact.php` file. It is caused by improper sanitization of user input submitted via POST requests, specifically through the `name`, `city`, `email`, `state`, and `message` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of proper encoding or sanitization of user-supplied data before displaying it on a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database, potentially gaining complete control of the application and server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page. These scripts can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attack is carried out through a crafted URL, specifically by manipulating the `action` GET parameter in `index.php`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attack occurs through a crafted POST request to `contact.php`, injecting malicious scripts into the `name`, `city`, `email`, `state`, and `message` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific user privileges are needed.
*   For SQL Injection, attacker needs to craft SQL injection payload and inject it into `action` parameter of `index.php`
*   For XSS, attacker needs to craft malicious XSS payload and inject it into `name`, `city`, `email`, `state`, and `message` parameters of `contact.php`
