        "details": {
            "Root cause": "The Joomla! BeeHeard component (versions 1.0) is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). The vulnerability exists because the 'controller' parameter in the component's URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include local files from the server.",
            "Weaknesses": [
                "Insecure direct object reference",
                 "Path traversal"
            ],
            "Impact": "An attacker can read sensitive local files on the server.",
            "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a URL with a manipulated 'controller' parameter that includes path traversal sequences (e.g., ../) and a target file path.",
            "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable Joomla! component, and they do not need to be authenticated."
