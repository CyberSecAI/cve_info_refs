  "CVE-2010-1253": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because of the way that Microsoft Office Excel parses the Excel file format when opening a specially crafted Excel file, specifically when handling DBQueryExt records. Due to a lack of checking when parsing particular fields within the structure, it is possible to get a user-controlled pointer to be called.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of DBQueryExt records",
        "Lack of input validation/bounds checking",
        "Uncontrolled pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the credentials of the currently logged-in user. An attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted Excel file received via email",
        "Visiting a website hosting a malicious Excel file"
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Excel file that exploits the vulnerability and convince the victim to open the file. No special privileges are required."
