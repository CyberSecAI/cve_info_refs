            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

RESOLUTION

HP has made the following procedures available to resolve the vulnerabilities.

For Windows

Disable JBoss WebConsole

Rename:
\HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jmx-console.war
\HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\management\console-mgr.sar\web-console.war

To:
\HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jmx-console.war.disable
\HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\management\console-mgr.sar\web-console.war.disable

Note: The JBoss WebConsole is disabled in BSM v9.10 and subsequent. The changes above \
are only needed for versions prior to v9.10.

Disable Status Servlet

Edit this file
BAC 8.7: \HPBAC\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jbossweb-tomcat55.sar\ROOT.war\WEB-INF\web.xml
 BSM 9.x: \HPBSM\EJBContainer\server\mercury\deploy\jboss-web.deployer\ROOT.war\WEB-INF\web.xml
 to add <!- and -> as follows:

<!--

<servlet>
<servlet-name>Status Servlet</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.jboss.web.tomcat.tc5.StatusServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>Status Servlet</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/status</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

- -->

For Solaris

For Solaris the procedure is the same as for Windows.

The Solaris files are:

/opt/HPBAC/EJBContainer/server/mercury/deploy/mx-console.war
/opt/HPBAC/EJBContainer\server/mercury/deploy/management/console-mgr.sar/web-console.war
 BAC 8.7: /opt/HPBAC/EJBContainer/server/mercury/deploy/jbossweb-tomcat55.sar/ROOT.war/WEB-INF/web.xml
 BSM 9.x: /opt/HPBSM/EJBContainer/server/mercury/deploy/jboss-web.deployer/ROOT.war/WEB-INF/web.xml

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=585900#c0)  Marc Schoenefeld    2010-04-26 11:26:51 UTC  ``` The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.2.0.CP03 and 4.3.0.CP01 updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 fixed an issue ([CVE-2008-3273](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3273)) where unauthenticated users were able to access the status servlet; however, a bug fix included in the 4.2.0.CP06 and 4.3.0.CP04 updates re-introduced the issue.  A remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire details about deployed web contexts.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=585900#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-27 03:19:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.2.0 for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2010:0376 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0376.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=585900#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-27 03:39:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 4  Via RHSA-2010:0377 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0377.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=585900#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-27 03:55:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.2.0 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2010:0378 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0378.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=585900#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-04-27 04:15:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEAP 4.3.0 for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2010:0379 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0379.html>   ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

## Topic

Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBEAP) 4.3 packages that fix
three security issues and multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 as JBEAP 4.3.0.CP08.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market leading platform for
innovative and scalable Java applications; integrating the JBoss
Application Server, with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam into a complete,
simple enterprise solution.

This release of JBEAP for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 serves as a
replacement to JBEAP 4.3.0.CP07.

These updated packages include multiple bug fixes which are detailed in the
Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available shortly from the link
in the References section.

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

The JMX Console configuration only specified an authentication requirement
for requests that used the GET and POST HTTP "verbs". A remote attacker
could create an HTTP request that does not specify GET or POST, causing it
to be executed by the default GET handler without authentication. This
release contains a JMX Console with an updated configuration that no longer
specifies the HTTP verbs. This means that the authentication requirement is
applied to all requests. (CVE-2010-0738)

For the CVE-2010-0738 issue, if an immediate upgrade is not possible or the
server deployment has been customized, a manual fix can be applied. Refer
to the "Security" subsection of the "Issues fixed in this release" section
(JBPAPP-3952) of the JBEAP Release Notes, linked to in the References, for
details. Contact Red Hat JBoss Support for advice before making the changes
noted in the Release Notes.

Red Hat would like to thank Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon of Minded
Security for responsibly reporting the CVE-2010-0738 issue.

Unauthenticated access to the JBoss Application Server Web Console
(/web-console) is blocked by default. However, it was found that this block
was incomplete, and only blocked GET and POST HTTP verbs. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information. This release
contains a Web Console with an updated configuration that now blocks all
unauthenticated access to it by default. (CVE-2010-1428)

The RHSA-2008:0828 update fixed an issue (CVE-2008-3273) where
unauthenticated users were able to access the status servlet; however, a
bug fix included in the RHSA-2009:0349 update re-introduced the issue. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to acquire details about deployed web
contexts. (CVE-2010-1429)

Warning: Before applying this update, please backup the JBEAP
"server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, and any other customized
configuration files.

All users of JBEAP 4.3 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=585899#c0)  Marc Schoenefeld    2010-04-26 11:15:18 UTC  ``` Unauthenticated access to the JBoss Application Server Web Console (/web-console) is blocked by default. However, it was found that this block was incomplete, and only blocked GET and POST HTTP "verbs".
