{
  "cveId": "CVE-2010-1428",
  "description": "Unauthenticated access to the JBoss Application Server Web Console (/web-console) is blocked by default. However, it was found that this block was incomplete, and only blocked GET and POST HTTP \"verbs\". A remote attacker could use this flaw to gain access to sensitive information.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The JBoss Application Server Web Console's authentication mechanism incompletely blocked unauthenticated access by only restricting GET and POST HTTP methods, while other HTTP methods were not properly restricted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete access control",
      "Improper restriction of HTTP methods"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information exposed through the JBoss Application Server Web Console.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network access using HTTP requests with methods other than GET or POST"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
    "HP Business Availability Center (BAC) v8.07 and earlier on Windows and Solaris",
    "Business Service Management (BSM) v9.12 and earlier on Windows",
    "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.2.0 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5",
