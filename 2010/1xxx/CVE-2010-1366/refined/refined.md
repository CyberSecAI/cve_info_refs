Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `admin_login.php` script of the Uiga Fan Club application. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`admin_name` and `admin_password`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization, leading to a classic SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the code directly uses the values from `$_POST['admin_name']` and `$_POST['admin_password']` within the SQL query:
    ```php
    $sql="SELECT *
          FROM admin
          WHERE admin_name='$admin_name' and admin_password='$admin_password'";
    ```

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the Uiga Fan Club application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin_login.php` page.
    *   The attack leverages the `admin_name` and `admin_password` parameters in the POST request.
    *   Specifically, the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows how to exploit the vulnerability by using `' or '1=1` as both the username and password.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `admin_login.php` script. No special privileges are needed.

**Summary:**

The Uiga Fan Club 1.0 application suffers from a SQL injection vulnerability in its `admin_login.php` script. By injecting SQL code into the login form, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative access. The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
