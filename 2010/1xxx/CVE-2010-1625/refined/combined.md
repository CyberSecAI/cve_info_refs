I discovered and reported this bug at the same time as two other XSS
issues, including the one covered by CVE-2009-4497.  While the commit
may be a few days apart for some of these, I think they can safely
fall under the same CVE, unless it's standard practice to assign CVEs
for each of several related minor issues.

The description at cve.mitre.org covers an XSS bug in  the "ident"
parameter.  It does not mention a second XSS bug which was also fixed
in the search body, which is separate from a third bug, the search
title, fixed here.

Sigh, yes.

So to sum it up:

1.  XSS in the ident parameter, as described in CVE-2009-4497.

2.  XSS that is reflected via the search results page after issuing
This one is now CVE-2010-1625

3. 3.  XSS that is reflected via the <title> tag on the search page, as
described in Raphael's original e-mail a few days ago, which Josh assigned
CVE-2010-1448

Thanks.

Subject: Re: CVE request: lxr

Sorry for not making this explicitly clear.  There are three issues:

1.  XSS in the ident parameter, as described in CVE-2009-4497.

2.  XSS that is reflected via the search results page after issuing a search.

3.  XSS that is reflected via the <title> tag on the search page, as
described in Raphael's original e-mail a few days ago, which Josh just
assigned CVE-2010-1448.

Bugs 1 and 2 were fixed simultaneously, as indicated in the 2010-01-05
changelog entry for LXR:

2010-01-05 18:00  mbox

	* ident, search: Fix for CVE-2009-4497 from Dan Rosenberg

	  Avoid a XSS vulnerability

Bug 3 was fixed a few days later on 2010-01-15, as indicated by:

2010-01-15 23:23  mbox

	* lib/LXR/Common.pm: Fix XSS exploit in title string

So, while my original intent at the time of disclosure was to have a
single CVE identifier assigned to cover all three of these issues,
that obviously did not happen.  As it stands, bugs 1 and 3 have their
own CVE identifiers, and bug 2 remains unassigned.

Another factor is when they are published at the same time.

> Can someone verify what is the policy by the book?

It's never as easy as just a couple rules, unfortunately.  In this case,
CVE-2009-4497 has been around for a long time, so it's strongly attached
to *only* the "i" parameter/ident issue.  It's too risky to change the
fundamental meaning of a CVE after it's been published.  (So even though
the intention of Dan's original request may have been to cover other
issues, that's not what it looks like to the public any more.)

Josh assigned CVE-2010-1448 for the search page issue, and now Dan has
alluded to a third issue that is neither ident nor search page, but we
don't know what that third issue is.

If Dan's issue is what he calls "a third XSS bug" in
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/05/03/7> then I'd want a
different CVE for it - since it's addressed in a separate "version" than
the other two XSS bugs.

The crux of the problem here is that the original bug report alluded to
"several" XSS but only listed the ident issue; our CVE description
typically might say "multiple XSS, for example this particular vector,"
but we didn't do that... and neither does the vendor specifically indicate
that the other vaguely-specified issues were actually addressed.

Just to clarify, two XSS bugs were fixed with a single release (new
version 0.9.8), and then ten days later, an update was included to
resolve a third XSS bug.  The original CVE was originally requested
for "multiple XSS vulnerabilities", but the description only covers
one of them.
