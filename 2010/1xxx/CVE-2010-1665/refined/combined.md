How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1006-1: WebKit vulnerabilities

19 October 2010

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [webkit](/security/cves?package=webkit) -

## Details

A large number of security issues were discovered in the WebKit browser and

JavaScript engines. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious

website, a remote attacker could exploit a variety of issues related to web

browser security, including cross-site scripting attacks, denial of

service attacks, and arbitrary code execution.

Please consult the bug listed at the top of this advisory to get the exact

list of CVE numbers fixed for each release.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that

use WebKit, such as Epiphany and Midori, to make all the necessary changes.
