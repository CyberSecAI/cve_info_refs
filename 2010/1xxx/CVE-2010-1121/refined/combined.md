# USN-930-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

29 June 2010

Firefox could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file or website.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) - Safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.2) - XUL + XPCOM application runner

## Details

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

Mozilla has changed the support model for Firefox and they no longer

support version 3.0 of the browser. As a result, Ubuntu is providing an

upgrade to Firefox 3.6 for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS users, which is the most current

stable release of Firefox supported by Mozilla. When upgrading, users

should be aware of the following:

* Firefox 3.6 does not support version 5 of the Sun Java plugin. Please use

  icedtea-java7-plugin or sun-java6-plugin instead.
* After upgrading to Firefox 3.6.6, users may be prompted to upgrade 3rd

  party Add-Ons. In some cases, an Add-On will not be compatible with

  Firefox 3.6.6 and have no update available. In these cases, Firefox will

  notify the user that it is disabling the Add-On.
* Upgrades to Ubuntu 8.10 from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS may break the browser.

  Ubuntu 8.10 is no longer officially supported and users are required to

  upgrade to 9.04 to receive active security support and a functional browser.
* Font configuration cannot be controlled via Gnome settings. This is a

  known issue being tracked in <https://launchpad.net/bugs/559149> and will

  be fixed in a later update.
* helix-player is not currently supported in Firefox 3.6. This is a known

  issue and may be fixed in a future update.
* RealAudio via the totem plugin is no longer supported in Firefox 3.6 in

  Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Affected users navigating to Real content will be

  prompted to install optional community supported packages.
* In Ubuntu 8.04 LTS the xine plugin is non-functional. After upgrading to

  Firefox 3.6, the plugin may cause the browser to crash, while in Firefox

  3.0 it would be silently ignored. Users are advised to uninstall

  xine-plugin and/or gxineplugin.
* Plugins using external helpers (such as Totem) may not close when using

  the Epiphany browser. This is a known issue being tracked in

  <https://launchpad.net/bugs/599796> and will be fixed in a later update.

  This issue only affects Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-25

## Re-use of freed object due to scope confusion

Announced
April 1, 2010
Reporter
Nils (MWR InfoSecurity)
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.10
* Firefox 3.6.3
* SeaMonkey 2.0.5
* Thunderbird 3.0.5

### Description

A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
security researcher **Nils** of MWR InfoSecurity during the
2010 Pwn2Own contest sponsored by TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
By moving DOM nodes between documents Nils found a case where the moved
node incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could
be triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this freed
object.

The contest winning exploit only affects Firefox 3.6
and not earlier versions.

Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and
Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the browser
engine were patched just in case there
is an alternate way of triggering the underlying flaw.

firefox security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2010-0500)

Original Release Date: June 25, 2010

Last Revised: July 7, 2011

Number: ASA-2010-165

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1121](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1121.html), [CVE-2010-1200](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1200.html), [CVE-2010-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1202.html) and [CVE-2010-1203](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1203.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for
a plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1198](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1198.html) to this issue.

Several integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed
web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to
crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-1196](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1196.html) and [CVE-2010-1199](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1199.html) to these issues.

A focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A
malicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,
such as usernames and passwords. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1125](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1125.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the "Content-Disposition:
attachment" HTTP header when the "Content-Type: multipart" HTTP header was
also present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the
"Content-Disposition: attachment" HTTP header to prevent content from being
displayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content
to users. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-1197](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1197.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could
be used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different
websites. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2008-5913](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2008-5913.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.
Certain security checks were not being called when an XML document was
loaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load
certain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its
add-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML
document. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-0182](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-0182.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0500.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using RHEL4 with the affected version of firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 2.0 including 2.0 SP1 and 2.0 SP2 | Low | See recommended actions below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 5.2.2 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ZDI-CAN-761: Pwn2Own: Mozilla Firefox Code Execution Vulnerability
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following
products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability was received through the 2010 Pwn2Own competition at
CanSecWest on March 24th. It is a remotely executable code execution
vulnerability affecting the latest available versions of Mozilla
Firefox.
The attached PoC was directly provided to us from the contestant at the
competition. Launch index.html to reproduce. It appears the crux of the
issue lies here:
function start() {
o61=document.getElementById('container').contentDocument.createElement('button');
o61.toString();
document.getElementById('container').contentWindow.location.reload();
window.setTimeout('start2()',100);
}
function start2() {
o101=document.getElementById('container').contentDocument.createElement('b');
o61.ownerDocument.open();
o101.appendChild(o61);
o61 = null;
gc();
location.href = 'hs.html';}
This is a cursory analysis. We expect to have a follow-up next week when
we have had time to dissect the supplied details further. We appreciate
updates and any additional details you may have on the matter as well.
Version(s) tested: Latest version of Firefox as of 3/24/2010
Platform(s) tested: Latest version of Windows 7 as of 3/24/2010

This article indicates the vulnerability might only be present on 64-bit system with windows 7. <http://tech.spreadit.org/pwn2own-2010/>
Other press has indicate that the results of the test case should launch calc.exe. We need to figure out if that is what we are watching for.
Checking the test case on a 32bit win XP vm with Firefox 3.6.2 it doesn't appear to show any problems. The test case has been running for several hours. It soaks up 99% cpu use and its up to 300MB of memory use, but no other indications of problems.

The payload does look like the standard calc-launcher (I haven't compared to metasploit to verify). I'm not surprised that part didn't "work" if you're not on a Win7 machine, but I'm surprised it didn't crash (I don't crash on WinXp 32-bit either). Part of the exploit looks like he's trying to mimic a particular object's memory layout, maybe on the not-quite-right target it just plays nice.
Mac crashes right away though

no crashes for me on vista with 3.5.8 or a 3.0.x build. they seem to pretty immune and fast and responsive when running the test case.
I've gotten a couple of crashes on 3.6b1 but no calc.exe's
[bp-e0e960fe-74b5-4bee-9beb-27f632100327](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/e0e960fe-74b5-4bee-9beb-27f632100327)

these stacks look quite a bit different than the others and we crash pretty quickly on 3.6 beta1

a rough regression range might be sometime in July

narrowing futher it looks like july30-july31 could be the range.
mozilla-central/3.6a1pre builds on and before july30 behave a more like 3.5.x, and the july 31 build on windows vista crashes consistently for me within a few seconds of loading the PoC.

a rough fix range on mozilla-central seems to be between 2009-11-09-04 and 1109-11-11-04. I'd check that last day in between but I'm late for dinner.

and no crash on Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20091111 Minefield/3.7a1pre
so I think the summary is
appears to be broken on mozilla-central after july31 and before nov10 -- then fixed then possibly fixed after that.
3.6betas and 3.6.x don't appear to have picked up the fix after it branched.
3.5.x appears to never have been affected.

Regression range (dates from [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=555109#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move wrappers to new scope even if their parent hasn't been moved yet (ZDI-CAN-761)")):
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?startdate=2009-07-30&enddate=2009-07-31%2005:00>
The fix range (changesets pulled from about:buildconfig):
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=f4ef40336cc6&tochange=2eb351cc47d3>
Nothing in the regression range stands out. I think Jonas's fix for [bug 507023](/show_bug.cgi?id=507023 "RESOLVED FIXED - When inserting fragments into the DOM, use ContentAppended notification when possible") was too early and would have been in the previous day's build. Maybe one of bz's checkins, like [bug 281387](/show_bug.cgi?id=281387 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsIFrame::Append/InsertFrames should take nsFrameList&")?
None of the check-ins in the fix range seem likely to match up with damage from the bustage range.Whiteboard: [sg:critical] ZDI CanSecWest 2010 bug [fix-window-wanted?] → [sg:critical] ZDI CanSecWest 2010 bug

I believe something in [Bug 492713](/show_bug.cgi?id=492713 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove location property protection (sDoSecurityCheckInAddProperty).") doesn't handle document.open properly.
Maybe something in prototype handling of the old inner window, but I'm

That's weird, it just removed a call to MorphSlimWrapper because it wasn't needed in some cases, it wasn't expected to fix any crashes. We should figure out what's going wrong without it.

So this is a bug in nsXPConnect::ReparentScopeAwareWrappers() where depending on the order in which the wrappers in the given scope end up being reparented we either reparent them or we don't. The key in the testcase is the call to document.open(), which triggers the call to nsXPConnect::ReparentScopeAwareWrappers(), and if we in that code end up reparenting the document before we reparent nodes that belong to that document, we're fine, but if the order is reversed, we end up not reparenting all wrappers and later on can leave dangling wrapper pointers in XPConnect's hashes, which leads to the crash/exploit.
We have a fix that fixes this particular crash, but not all variations of it. mrbkap is working on a complete fix and expects to have that done tomorrow.
And this code goes way back, at least to 1.9.0, so 1.9.1 is for sure affected, as is trunk, the testcase just needs to be different to trigger it (but we don't know quite how).blocking1.9.1: ? → ---

This patch works, but I'm leaking a ton with it. I'll debug more tomorrow.
I also have concerns about objects that return a newParent from their PreCreate hooks that is tied to the old global. I'm considering recursively calling the PreCreate hook up the chain (and possibly memoizing results) to protect against such objects.

We're leaking documents, in the CC I see a small cycle between the document for sploit/main.html , a parser and a content sink, but there's an unknown edge to the document too. I'm still trying to figure out what that edge is.

When we check in this thing, I want us to have a good sense of what it might break and what QA can do to verify that we aren't going to ship something with unintended consequences. Right now, we have a single testcase and that doesn't seem like enough data to ship this.
Can we get automated tests for this to be checked in after we ship? Can dev give an idea of the potential consequences of this fix and where we might break Firefox or extensions, etc?

jst and I decided to stick with this approach. It's correct for the DOM, but potentially not if a weird extension defines certain types of C++ scriptable objects with bizarro properties.
I have a sketch of a patch (I haven't even compiled it yet) that should help deal with even weird objects, but this is far and away less risky and less code.

So that bug needs to block everwhere this one does? Or we add it to the "Depends on" list? Seems like a recipe for forgetting it.
I guess for trunk that's fine, but for branches we'd like a combined patch anyway just to make sure everything goes in. (bonus points for obfuscating the actual fix a little.)blocking1.9.1: ? → .10+

Crash fix
Approved for 1.9.2.3 and 1.9.2.4, a=dveditz for release-drivers
Please wait for the 1.9.2 branch tinderboxen to go green after checking in (1.9.2.4) before checking into the relbranch (1.9.2.3).
Although this patch is slightly different than what was ultimately checked in, mrbkap says he will be qimporting the actual checkin to make sure the branches match.

Why? We should land on both branches at the same time, IMO, so that we can spin builds as soon as the trees turn green.

We do want a 1.9.1 branch patch for this (and [bug 556241](/show_bug.cgi?id=556241 "RESOLVED FIXED - HTMLContentSink needs to participate in cycle collection")), and I'd be more comfortable having it ready just in case someone finds a way to exploit this in Firefox 3.5 and we need to firedrill.

I can't get this to crash with my 1.9.1 builds and others have noted above that the PoC, as written, doesn't trigger crashes on 1.9.1. There isn't anything that I can do to verify this for 1.9.1 specifically. The same fix in the same code fixed the issue in 1.9.2 though.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.5.10, fixing various bugs
and security issues.
MFSA 2010-33 / CVE-2008-5913:
Security researcher Amit Klein reported that it was possible to reverse
engineer the value used to seed Math.random(). Since the pseudo-random
number generator was only seeded once per browsing session, this seed
value could be used as a unique token to identify and track users
across different web sites.
MFSA 2010-32 / CVE-2010-1197:
Security researcher Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive reported that
the Content-Disposition: attachment HTTP header was ignored when
Content-Type: multipart was also present. This issue could potentially
lead to XSS problems in sites that allow users to upload arbitrary
files and specify a Content-Type but rely on Content-Disposition:
attachment to prevent the content from being displayed inline.
MFSA 2010-31 / CVE-2010-1125:
Google security researcher Michal Zalewski reported that focus()
could be used to change a user's cursor focus while they are
typing, potentially directing their keyboard input to an unintended
location. This behavior was also present across origins when content
from one domain was embedded within another via an IFRAME. A malicious
web page could use this behavior to steal keystrokes from a victim
while they were typing sensitive information such as a password.
MFSA 2010-30 / CVE-2010-1199:
Security researcher Martin Barbella reported via TippingPoint's Zero
Day Initiative that an XSLT node sorting routine contained an integer
overflow vulnerability. In cases where one of the nodes to be sorted
contained a very large text value, the integer used to allocate a
memory buffer to store its value would overflow, resulting in too small
a buffer being created. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
write data past the end of the buffer, causing the browser to crash
and potentially running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-29 / CVE-2010-1196:
Security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity reported that the routine
for setting the text value for certain types of DOM nodes contained an
integer overflow vulnerability. When a very long string was passed to
this routine, the integer value used in creating a new memory buffer
to hold the string would overflow, resulting in too small a buffer
being allocated. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write
data past the end of the buffer, causing a crash and potentially
running arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-28 / CVE-2010-1198:
Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported that two plugin instances
could interact in a way in which one plugin gets a reference to an
object owned by a second plugin and continues to hold that reference
after the second plugin is unloaded and its object is destroyed. In
these cases, the first plugin would contain a pointer to freed memory
which, if accessed, could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary
code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-27 / CVE-2010-0183:
Security researcher wushi of team509 reported that the frame
construction process for certain types of menus could result in a menu
containing a pointer to a previously freed menu item. During the cycle
collection process, this freed item could be accessed, resulting in the
execution of a section of code potentially controlled by an attacker.
MFSA 2010-26 / CVE-2010-1200 / CVE-2010-1201 / CVE-2010-1202 / CVE-2010-1203:
Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some
of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some
of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2010-25 / CVE-2010-1121:
A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by
security researcher Nils of MWR InfoSecurity during the 2010 Pwn2Own
contest sponsored by TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. By moving
DOM nodes between documents Nils found a case where the moved node
incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could
be triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this
freed object. The contest winning exploit only affects Firefox 3.6
and not earlier versions. Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5,
SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the
browser engine were patched just in case there is an alternate way
of triggering the underlying flaw.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Details

USN-930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox and Xulrunner. This update

provides updated packages for use with Firefox 3.6 and Xulrunner 1.9.2 on

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1121](/security/CVE-2010-1121))

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a

user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1200](/security/CVE-2010-1200), [CVE-2010-1201](/security/CVE-2010-1201),

[CVE-2010-1202](/security/CVE-2010-1202), [CVE-2010-1203](/security/CVE-2010-1203))

A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker

could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a

second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1198](/security/CVE-2010-1198))

An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1196](/security/CVE-2010-1196))

Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting

routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1199](/security/CVE-2010-1199))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be

subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote

attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. ([CVE-2010-1125](/security/CVE-2010-1125))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the 'Content-Disposition: attachment'

HTTP header was ignored when 'Content-Type: multipart' was also present.

Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site

scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-1197](/security/CVE-2010-1197))

Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator

often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users

across different web sites. ([CVE-2008-5913](/security/CVE-2008-5913))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
