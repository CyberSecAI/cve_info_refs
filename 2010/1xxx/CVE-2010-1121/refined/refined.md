  "CVE-2010-1121": {
    "description": "A memory corruption flaw leading to code execution was reported by security researcher **Nils** of MWR InfoSecurity during the 2010 Pwn2Own contest sponsored by TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. By moving DOM nodes between documents Nils found a case where the moved node incorrectly retained its old scope. If garbage collection could be triggered at the right time then Firefox would later use this freed object.The contest winning exploit only affects Firefox 3.6 and not earlier versions. Updated (June 22, 2010): Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0 based on earlier versions of the browser engine were patched just in case there is an alternate way of triggering the underlying flaw.",
    "vulnerability": "Memory corruption due to incorrect scope retention of moved DOM nodes",
    "impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the program.",
    "attack_vector": "By tricking a user into viewing a malicious website or file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker, able to craft malicious websites or files.",
     "root_cause": "When moving DOM nodes between documents, the moved node incorrectly retains its old scope."
