  "CVE-2010-1086": {
    "description": "A ULE decapsulation denial of service problem in DVB drivers was fixed that could be triggered by invalid DVB data packets.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) decapsulation code within the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, a crafted MPEG2-TS frame with a payload pointer value of 182 or 183 can trigger an infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of crafted data packets leading to an infinite loop.",
      "Lack of proper input validation for payload pointer values in ULE decapsulation."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service on the target system. The system gets stuck in an endless loop while trying to process the specially crafted MPEG2-TS frame.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted MPEG2-TS frame with an invalid Payload Pointer (182 or 183) to a vulnerable DVB receiver."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to send network packets (specifically, MPEG2-TS frames) to a target system that uses vulnerable DVB drivers."
