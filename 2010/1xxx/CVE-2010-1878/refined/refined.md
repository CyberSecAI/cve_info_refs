- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Joomla! component `com_orgchart` version 1.0.0 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). The `controller` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: LFI vulnerability due to insufficient input validation/sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially leading to information disclosure, or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter, an attacker can force the application to include arbitrary files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges and can be an unauthenticated user.
