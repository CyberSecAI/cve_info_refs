How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.

arbitrary CTCP commands. (CVE-2010-2785)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- lftp
This update of lftp improves the filename handling of downloaded files
to avoid downloading arbitrary content to unexpected locations (like
.login). (CVE-2010-2251)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libpython2\_6-1\_0
This update of python has a copy of libxmlrpc that is vulnerable to
denial of service bugs that can occur while processing malformed XML
input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,

to a corrupted heap memory. This bug can be exploited remotely with a
crafted TIFF file to cause an application crash or probably to execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1411)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libvorbis
This update of libvorbis fixes a memory corruption while parsing OGG
files. This bug was exploitable by remote attackers to cause an
application crash and could probably be exploited to execute arbitrary
code.
CVE-2009-2663: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8: Resource Management Errors (CWE-399)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- lxsession
lxsession-logout did not properly lock the screen before suspending,
hibernating and switching between users which could allow attackers with
physical access to take control of the system to obtain sensitive infor-
mation and / or execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who is
currently logged in (CVE-2010-2532).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- mono-addon-bytefx-data-mysql/bytefx-data-mysql
Mono's ASP.NET implementation did not set the 'EnableViewStateMac'
property by default. Attackers could exploit that to conduct cross-
site-scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2010-1459)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- moodle

- CVE-2010-0653: Opera permits cross-origin loading of CSS style sheets
even when the style sheet download has an incorrect
MIME type and the style sheet document is malformed,
which allows remote HTTP servers to obtain sensitive
information via a crafted document.
- CVE-2010-1993: Opera 9.52 does not properly handle an IFRAME element
with a mailto: URL in its SRC attribute, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via an HTML document with many IFRAME
elements.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS was prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities which could
allow remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code via
unspecified vectors. (CVE-2010-0438)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- popt
This update fixes the problem where RPM misses to clear the SUID/SGID
bit of old files during package updates. (CVE-2010-2059)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
This update of postgresql was pblished to fix several minor security
vulnerabilities:
- CVE-2010-1975: postgresql does not properly check privileges during
certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.
- CVE-2010-1169: Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures,
which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- python-mako
Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly
escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- vte
VTE was vulnerable to an old title set+query attack which could be used
by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2713).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- w3m
w3m did not handle embedded nul characters in the common name and in
subject alternative names of x509 certificates.
CVE-2010-2074 has been assigned to this issue.
This update also turns on verification of x509 certificates by default
which was not the case before.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- xmlrpc-c
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
