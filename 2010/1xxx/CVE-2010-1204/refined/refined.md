Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from a lack of proper access control in Bugzilla's search functionality. Specifically, the system did not restrict access to time-tracking related fields in boolean chart searches based on the `timetrackinggroup` parameter. This allowed any user, even those not part of the designated time-tracking group, to construct search queries that included time-tracking fields, potentially revealing sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness was the failure to enforce permission checks on time-tracking fields when executing boolean chart searches.
*  **Information Disclosure:**  The lack of access control led to information disclosure of potentially sensitive time-tracking data to unauthorized users.
* **URL Hacking/Saved Queries:** The vulnerability could be exploited by directly crafting URLs or using previously saved queries. The time tracking fields were not shown in the drop-down list, therefore the attacker needed to use URL hacking or a previously saved query to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Unauthorized users could access information about the time spent on bugs, potentially revealing project timelines, resource allocation, and other internal data.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Exposure of time-tracking data could violate the privacy of developers and other users whose work hours were being tracked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers could directly construct URLs to include time-tracking fields in their search queries, bypassing the intended access restrictions.
*   **Saved Queries:** Attackers could potentially leverage previously saved search queries that include time-tracking fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Bugzilla Access:** The attacker needed to have basic access to the Bugzilla instance to be able to perform searches.
*   **Knowledge of Time-Tracking Fields:** The attacker needed some level of understanding of the time-tracking fields and parameters used by Bugzilla.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs or Utilize Saved Queries**: The attacker would need to be able to either directly create search URLs with time-tracking parameters or have access to pre-existing saved queries using the parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Bugzilla versions 2.17.1 to 3.2.6, 3.3.1 to 3.4.6, 3.5.1 to 3.6, and 3.7.
*   The fix involved adding a check to `Search.pm` to ensure users performing searches including time tracking fields were members of the designated time-tracking group.
*   Patches were made available for various affected branches, including 2.18, 2.20, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6 and trunk.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Teemu Mannermaa.
