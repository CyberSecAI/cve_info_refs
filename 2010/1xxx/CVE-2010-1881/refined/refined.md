## Analysis of CVE-2010-1881

The provided content relates to **CVE-2010-1881**, a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Office Access.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided information:

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way the **FieldList ActiveX control** (part of ACCWIZ.dll - Microsoft Access Wizard Controls) is instantiated by Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer.

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable within the ACCWIZ.DLL, specifically a memory corruption vulnerability that occurs when the FieldList ActiveX control is instantiated with specially crafted persisted storage data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **E-mail attack scenario:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.  This includes sending a specially crafted HTML-formatted e-mail message that contains Office ActiveX controls.
*   **Web-based attack scenario:** An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains Office ActiveX controls that are used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. Compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could also be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to run arbitrary code as the logged-on user.
*   If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
*   Attackers could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
*   Users with limited user rights are less impacted.

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
*   Microsoft Office Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Windows Mail, and Windows Live Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone by default, which disables script and ActiveX controls, removing the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code.
*   Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in Enhanced Security Configuration by default.

**Workarounds:**

*   Do not open Microsoft Office files from untrusted sources.
*   Set the kill bit for the FieldList ActiveX control to prevent it from running in Internet Explorer.
*   Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.
*   Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.

**Affected Software (as per MS10-044):**

*   Microsoft Office Access 2003 Service Pack 3
