# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-05-03 11:05:22 UTC  ``` Safe.pm 2.26 and earlier (except 2.20 through 2.23 if using a threads-enabled  Perl), when used in Perl 5.10.0 and earlier, may allow attackers to break out of safe compartment in (1) Safe::reval or (2) Safe::rdo using subroutine  references, whose execution is delayed to happen outside of the safe compartment.   If a victim was tricked into running a specially-crafted Perl script, using  Safe extension module, it could lead to intended Safe module restrictions  bypass, if the returned subroutine reference was called from outside of the  compartment.

Safe fix makes sure that subroutines called form outside of the compartment is still restricted by Safe.  This approach did not work for PostgreSQL, which instead abandoned Safe and relies on Opcode now instead.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-05-20 16:58:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c8)) > This issue is public now, but MITRE has given it a strange description that  may > be confusing to people as it refers to PostgreSQL more than Perl: >   Detailed post trying to solve the current confusion:   [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/05/20/5>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-07 15:29:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0457 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0457.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-07 16:21:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0458 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0458.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c16)  Fedora Update System    2010-08-03 01:10:17 UTC  ``` perl-5.10.1-116.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=5#c0)  seth    1998-11-08 18:44:14 UTC  ``` I am reasonably certain that I have found an undocumented piece of behavior in the prerotate part of logrotate-2.6 In particular, commands have to succeed if logrotate will succeed.  This makes it clumsy to use logrotate to, for example, grep out potentially interesting pieces of log files.  Let me illustrate.  Here is an example from the relevant part of the config file.  prerotate  grep something filename >> output  endscript  If grep does not find anything, then the following error message is reported.  (I have just clipped out a piece from the error message that was mailed to me, of course the file name depends on what script is being run, but I have confirmed this with different logs and scripts).   errors occured while rotating /home/seth/adm/info.log  error running prerotate script --                                 leaving old log in place   However, if I add a test to check whether there is anything to grep before trying to grep:  prerotate check=`/usr/bin/grep passwd /home/seth/adm/info.log ` if [ -n "$check" ] ; then grep passwd /home/seth/adm/info.log >> output fi endscript  Then it works all right.  I can reliably repeat this error.  Thanks for any feedback about the validity of this analysis.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=5#c1)  zblaxell    1998-11-17 19:16:59 UTC  ``` Two solutions:  	grep something filename >> output || exit 0  (i.e. grep succeeds, or 'exit 0' succeeds)  or:  	grep something filename | cat >> output  (the pipeline will ignore the exit status of grep, but will still report errors such as "no space left on device" or "permission denied" or "I/O error").  Perhaps the documentation should be updated.  The principle of least surprise says that the established behavior shouldn't change.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=5#c2)  seth    1998-11-20 05:43:59 UTC  ``` Ok...I looked in the source code.  I can see starting line 395    if (runScript(log->files[logNum], log->pre)) {                     fprintf(errorFile, "error running prerotate script --                                 leaving old log in place\n");                     hasErrors = 1;  And RunScript() is returning the result from the system command. So presumably a grep that finds nothing is appearing to be an error.   It has been a while since I have played with system() Isn't it possible to have more nuance in interpreting the kinds of errors?  If not, then perhaps the man page should be modified to reflect this fact.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=5#c3)  Preston Brown    1998-11-20 12:00:59 UTC  ``` by de facto standard, unix commands exit with a nonzero status when there has been an error.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=5#c4)  seth    1998-11-20 14:23:59 UTC  ``` > by de facto standard, unix commands exit with a nonzero status   > when there has been an error.  True.  But you do not seem to appreciate the point that the manpage logrotate(1) does not inform what logrotates behavior will be under those circumstances.  Here is the relevant piece:   prerotate/endscript               The lines between prerotate and endscript (both  of               which  must appear on lines by themselves) are exe-               cuted before the log file is rotated. These  direc-               tives  may only appear inside of a log file defini-               tion.  See postrotate as well  Nowhere does it say "Failures will result in the non-execution of the rotation" or warn that this also means that greps that return nothing will count as a failure.  You can discard the issue if you want, but it is poor documentation, especially when one considers the "typical" use of a prerotate script would be pull out and save potentially interesting things from a log file, and where one is likely to get a grep that returns nothing.  Cheers,   Seth   ``` |  |

# CVE 2010-1447

The Safe (aka Safe.pm) module 2.26, and certain earlier versions, for Perl, as used in PostgreSQL 7.4 before 7.4.29, 8.0 before 8.0.25, 8.1 before 8.1.21, 8.2 before 8.2.17, 8.3 before 8.3.11, 8.4 before 8.4.4, and 9.0 Beta before 9.0 Beta 2, allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended (1) Safe::reval and (2) Safe::rdo access restrictions, and inject and execute arbitrary code, via vectors involving subroutine references and delayed execution.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=576508#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-24 10:31:31 UTC  ```   Safe.pm 2.24 and earlier, when used in Perl 5.10.0 and earlier, may allow attackers to break out of safe compartment in (1) Safe::reval or (2) Safe::rdo  using implicitly called methods (such as DESTROY or AUTOLOAD) on implicitly  blessed Perl objects, returned as a result of unsafe code evaluation. These  methods could have been executed unrestricted by Safe, when such objects were  accessed or destroyed.   If a victim was tricked into running a specially-crafted Perl script, using  Safe extension module, it could lead to intended Safe module restriction bypass.   Different vulnerability than [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447).    Solution: Upgrade to Safe.pm v2.25 or higher.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-05-03 11:05:22 UTC  ``` Safe.pm 2.26 and earlier (except 2.20 through 2.23 if using a threads-enabled  Perl), when used in Perl 5.10.0 and earlier, may allow attackers to break out of safe compartment in (1) Safe::reval or (2) Safe::rdo using subroutine  references, whose execution is delayed to happen outside of the safe compartment.   If a victim was tricked into running a specially-crafted Perl script, using  Safe extension module, it could lead to intended Safe module restrictions  bypass, if the returned subroutine reference was called from outside of the  compartment.   Different vulnerability than [CVE-2010-1168](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1168).  Solution: Ugrade to Safe.pm v2.27 or higher.  References:   [1] <http://search.cpan.org/~rgarcia/Safe-2.27/Safe.pm>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tim Bunce for responsibly reporting this flaw. Upstream credits also Rafaël Garcia-Suarez for discovering of this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-05-03 11:28:13 UTC  ``` This is [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c8)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-19 21:08:05 UTC  ``` This issue is public now, but MITRE has given it a strange description that may be confusing to people as it refers to PostgreSQL more than Perl:  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1447> Assigned: 20100415 Reference: CONFIRM: <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1447> Reference: CONFIRM: <http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.1203> Reference: CONFIRM: <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/cve/2010-1447> Reference: CONFIRM: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588269](show_bug.cgi?id=588269 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-1447 perl: Safe restriction bypass when reference to subroutine in compartment is called from outside") Reference: SECUNIA:39845 Reference: URL: <http://secunia.com/advisories/39845> Reference: VUPEN:ADV-2010-1167 Reference: URL: <http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2010/1167>  PostgreSQL 7.4 before 7.4.29, 8.0 before 8.0.25, 8.1 before 8.1.21, 8.2 before 8.2.17, 8.3 before 8.3.11, 8.4 before 8.4.4, and 9.0 Beta before 9.0 Beta 2 does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary Perl code via a crafted script, related to the Safe module (aka Safe.pm) for Perl.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2010-05-20 07:02:16 UTC  ``` It's probably PostgreSQL announcement that's causing the confusion, as it mentions perl [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) too, and there was no public reference for [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) at that time.  Quick disambiguation summary - [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) (for perl/Safe) and [CVE-2010-1169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1169) (for PostgreSQL) are closely related and describe basically the same issue. Safe fix makes sure that subroutines called form outside of the compartment is still restricted by Safe.  This approach did not work for PostgreSQL, which instead abandoned Safe and relies on Opcode now instead.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-05-20 16:58:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c8)) > This issue is public now, but MITRE has given it a strange description that  may > be confusing to people as it refers to PostgreSQL more than Perl: >   Detailed post trying to solve the current confusion:   [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/05/20/5>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-07 15:29:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0457 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0457.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-07 16:21:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0458 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0458.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c16)  Fedora Update System    2010-08-03 01:10:17 UTC  ``` perl-5.10.1-116.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.

Subject: CVE-2010-1974 reject request (dupe of CVE-2010-1168) and CVE-2010-1447
 description modification request

Hi Steve,

   this is due:

     a, [1] <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-1974>

        This is duplicate CVE identifier for the Perl Safe.pm module flaw,
        CVE-2010-1168 identifier has been originally assigned to:

        [2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-1168>

     b, [3] <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-1447>

        The description of this incorrectly states, it's PostgreSQL issue, but the true
        source code base, responsible for this deficiency is Perl's Safe.pm
        implementation. The source of this confusion is:
        [4] <http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.1203>

Attached are advisories from my original posts to vendor-sec channel for all four issues:
i, CVE-2010-1168 Perl's Safe.pm 2.25 and below deficiency, when handling
    implicit methods:
      [5] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=576508#c0>

ii, CVE-2010-1169 PostgreSQL's PL/Perl deficiency, present due dependency / use of
     Perl's Safe.pm extension module:
       [6] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=582615#c0>

iii, CVE-2010-1170 PostgreSQL's PL/Tcl deficiency by handling autoload():
       [7] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583072#c0>

iv, CVE-2010-1447 Perl's Safe.pm 2.27 and below deficiency (see attached archive for
     more information)
       [8] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c0>

Flaw history:
   1, Red Hat Security Response Team has been notified on 2010-03-18 with the details
      of this issue. Later CVE-2010-1168 has been assigned to this (but in that moment
      wasn't aware Rafael did already pseudo-published flaw details on his blog:
        [9] <http://blogs.perl.org/users/rafael_garcia-suarez/2010/03/new-safepm-fixes-security-hole.html>
   2, Later Tim Bunce identified similar deficiency in PostgreSQL's PL/Perl implementation.
      CVE-2010-1169 identifier has been assigned to this:
        [10] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-1169>

   3, Later Tom Lane identified similar deficiency in PostgreSQL's PL/Tcl implementation -- this
      is what CVE-2010-1170 has been assigned for:
        [11] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-1170>

   4, And finally, Tim Bunce and Rafael Garcia-Suarez recognized a yet another deficiency
      in Perl's Safe.pm implementation, allowing to bypass the Perl's Safe compartment constrains,
      by evaluation of unsafe code, returning returning references to subroutines, whose truly
      execution was delayed to happen later, outside of the Safe compartment.
        [12] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-1447>

Have checked today with Tim, there isn't any new perl Safe.pm extension module issue (besides CVE-2010-1168
and CVE-2010-1447 cases), which would desire a new CVE id (CVE-2010-1974 is dupe of CVE-2010-1168).

Steve, could you please:
   a, reject CVE-2010-1974 (<http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-1974>) as a duplicate
      CVE identifier for CVE-2010-1168 and,
   b, update description of CVE-2010-1447 (<http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-1447>)
      so it would reflect the true reason of the flaw, it was originally assigned for.

Hope this clarification is sufficient. In case of any doubt / need of further background information,
related with above four issues, please ask.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=583072#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-04-16 15:30:03 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the PostgreSQL enforced permission checks on scripts written in PL/Tcl. Once the PL/Tcl procedural language was registered on particular database, a remote, authenticated user, privileged to create databases, running a specially-crafted PL/Tcl script, could use this flaw to bypass intended PL/Tcl trusted mode restrictions, allowing them to run arbitrary Tcl scripts with the privileges of the database server.  References:   [1] PostgreSQL PL/Tcl procedural language manual page:       <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/pltcl.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=583072#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-04-21 16:18:11 UTC  ``` This is [CVE-2010-1170](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1170).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=583072#c11)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-17 16:40:20 UTC  ``` This is now public:  <http://www.postgresql.org/support/security.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=583072#c14)  Fedora Update System    2010-05-17 19:08:46 UTC  ``` postgresql-8.4.4-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/postgresql-8.4.4-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=583072#c15)  Fedora Update System    2010-05-17 19:08:56 UTC  ``` postgresql-8.3.11-1.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/postgresql-8.3.11-1.fc11>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=583072#c16)  Fedora Update System    2010-05-17 19:09:05 UTC  ``` postgresql-8.4.4-1.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/postgresql-8.4.4-1.fc13>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=583072#c17)  Fedora Update System    2010-05-18 21:45:05 UTC  ``` postgresql-8.4.4-1.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-05-03 11:05:22 UTC  ``` Safe.pm 2.26 and earlier (except 2.20 through 2.23 if using a threads-enabled  Perl), when used in Perl 5.10.0 and earlier, may allow attackers to break out of safe compartment in (1) Safe::reval or (2) Safe::rdo using subroutine  references, whose execution is delayed to happen outside of the safe compartment.   If a victim was tricked into running a specially-crafted Perl script, using  Safe extension module, it could lead to intended Safe module restrictions  bypass, if the returned subroutine reference was called from outside of the  compartment.   Different vulnerability than [CVE-2010-1168](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1168).  Solution: Ugrade to Safe.pm v2.27 or higher.  References:   [1] <http://search.cpan.org/~rgarcia/Safe-2.27/Safe.pm>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tim Bunce for responsibly reporting this flaw. Upstream credits also Rafaël Garcia-Suarez for discovering of this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-05-03 11:28:13 UTC  ``` This is [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c8)  Vincent Danen    2010-05-19 21:08:05 UTC  ``` This issue is public now, but MITRE has given it a strange description that may be confusing to people as it refers to PostgreSQL more than Perl:  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1447> Assigned: 20100415 Reference: CONFIRM: <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1447> Reference: CONFIRM: <http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.1203> Reference: CONFIRM: <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/cve/2010-1447> Reference: CONFIRM: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=588269](show_bug.cgi?id=588269 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-1447 perl: Safe restriction bypass when reference to subroutine in compartment is called from outside") Reference: SECUNIA:39845 Reference: URL: <http://secunia.com/advisories/39845> Reference: VUPEN:ADV-2010-1167 Reference: URL: <http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2010/1167>  PostgreSQL 7.4 before 7.4.29, 8.0 before 8.0.25, 8.1 before 8.1.21, 8.2 before 8.2.17, 8.3 before 8.3.11, 8.4 before 8.4.4, and 9.0 Beta before 9.0 Beta 2 does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary Perl code via a crafted script, related to the Safe module (aka Safe.pm) for Perl.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2010-05-20 07:02:16 UTC  ``` It's probably PostgreSQL announcement that's causing the confusion, as it mentions perl [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) too, and there was no public reference for [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) at that time.  Quick disambiguation summary - [CVE-2010-1447](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1447) (for perl/Safe) and [CVE-2010-1169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1169) (for PostgreSQL) are closely related and describe basically the same issue. Safe fix makes sure that subroutines called form outside of the compartment is still restricted by Safe.  This approach did not work for PostgreSQL, which instead abandoned Safe and relies on Opcode now instead.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-05-20 16:58:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c8)) > This issue is public now, but MITRE has given it a strange description that  may > be confusing to people as it refers to PostgreSQL more than Perl: >   Detailed post trying to solve the current confusion:   [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/05/20/5>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-07 15:29:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0457 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0457.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-06-07 16:21:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0458 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0458.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=588269#c16)  Fedora Update System    2010-08-03 01:10:17 UTC  ``` perl-5.10.1-116.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.
