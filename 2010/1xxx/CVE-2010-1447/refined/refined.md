```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability exists in the Safe.pm module for Perl, specifically in versions 2.26 and earlier (except 2.20-2.23 with threads-enabled perl). It allows bypassing intended restrictions via subroutine references when these references are evaluated using Safe::reval or Safe::rdo, and the execution is delayed and happens outside the safe compartment.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper restriction of subroutine references within Safe compartments.
- Delayed execution of subroutine references outside safe compartments.
- Inadequate security checks when using Safe::reval and Safe::rdo

Impact of exploitation:
Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary code, breaking out of the intended restrictions of the Safe module.

Attack vectors:
A specially-crafted Perl script using the Safe module, which leverages subroutine references that get executed outside of the intended safe compartment.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to trick a victim into executing the specially-crafted Perl script that uses vulnerable versions of the Safe.pm module.
