Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-1246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists due to the way Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files, specifically related to Real-Time Data (RTD) functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability. When parsing specially crafted Excel files with malformed RTD data, Excel incorrectly handles memory allocation or access, leading to potential corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including:
    *   Installing programs
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    *   Creating new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Attachment:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Excel file as an email attachment. The user needs to open the file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a website containing a malicious Excel file, or embed a malicious Excel file into a compromised website. The victim would need to visit the site and then be convinced to open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior access or valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious Excel file.
*   **Crafted Excel File:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed Excel file to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft Excel, including:
    *   Microsoft Office Excel 2002 Service Pack 3
    *   Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" because of user interaction needed to trigger exploit.
*   Microsoft provides a patch that corrects the way that Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
*   There were no reports of active exploitation at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   Mitigating factors include users with lower rights are less impacted, and social engineering required to trick the user into opening the malicious file.
