  "vulnerability": {
    "cveId": "CVE-2010-1422",
    "description": "An implementation issue exists in WebKit's handling of keyboard focus. If the keyboard focus changes during the processing of key presses, WebKit may deliver an event to the newly-focused frame, instead of the frame that had focus when the key press occurred. A maliciously crafted website may be able to manipulate a user into taking an unexpected action, such as initiating a purchase.",
    "rootCause": "An implementation issue in WebKit's keyboard focus handling. During the processing of key presses, if focus shifts to a different frame, the key event might be delivered to the newly focused frame instead of the frame that originally received the focus.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of keyboard focus events.",
       "Potential for cross-frame event manipulation"
    ],
    "impact": "A maliciously crafted website could exploit this vulnerability to redirect keyboard inputs to a different frame, potentially tricking the user into performing actions they did not intend (e.g., a user typing into a login form on one frame being redirected to a different frame, or initiating a purchase or other actions on a different frame).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious web page can alter the focus during keyboard events.",
      "Manipulation of web content using iframes."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to lure a victim to a website with malicious javascript and iframe elements."
