Subject: wafp insecure temporary directory

Wafp creates a temporary directory to predictable path and name. This
allows a local attacker to create a denial of service condition and
discloses sensitive information to unprivileged users. This also reduces
usability of this software, because one can't run more than one wafp-
instances at the same time. This issue can also be leveraged to delete
arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.

I notified the project:
<http://code.google.com/p/webapplicationfingerprinter/issues/detail?id=8>

Can I get CVE-identifier for this issue?

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application `wafp` creates a temporary directory with a predictable path and name.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Predictable temporary directory path and name.
  - Race condition vulnerability.
  - Potential for arbitrary file deletion via symlink attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Denial of service (DoS) by creating the temporary directory beforehand, preventing the application from running.
  - Disclosure of sensitive information to unprivileged users by gaining access to the temporary directory.
  - Reduced usability by preventing multiple instances of `wafp` from running concurrently.
  - Arbitrary file/directory deletion through symlink attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system where `wafp` is running. The attacker needs to be able to create files and directories.
