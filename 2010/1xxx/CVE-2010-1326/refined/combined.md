How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Last Modified: Monday, April 15, 2010 | [Home](/index.htm) > [CVS](/cvspro/) > [Security](/cvspro/security.htm) > Note 5871 |

| | **What is CVE?** CVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems. The goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with this "common enumeration." **What is a "vulnerability"?** An information security vulnerability is a mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network. See the Terminology page for a complete explanation of how this term is used on the CVE Web site. | | --- | | | Vulnerability or Exposure Note 5871 ([CVE-2010-1326](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1326))March Hare Software CVSNT branch name ACLOverviewMarch Hare Software CVSNT contains a branch name ACL vulnerability or exposure in the `cvs.exe`, `cvsnt.exe` or `/usr/bin/cvs` file, which may allow a remote, unauthorised attacker to execute arbitrary code on any installed operating system. I. DescriptionMarch Hare Software CVSNT provides support for Access Control Lists and Branches through the use of the `cvs.exe`, `cvsnt.exe` or `/usr/bin/cvs` component. The `cvs.exe`, `cvsnt.exe` or `/usr/bin/cvs` contains a vulnerability or exposure in the use of a branch name to authenticate an access control list, which affects CVSNT on all operating systems: CVSNT 2.0.58 and later (including all builds of 2.5.01, 2.5.02, 2.5.03 before build 3736 and 2.5.04 releases before build 2862; CVS Suite 2.5.03, CVS Suite 2008 before build 3736 and CVS Suite 2009 pre-releases before 3729. Exploit code for this vulnerability or exposure has been tested by March Hare Software. II. ImpactA non-privileged user may create a branch (or fake a branch on a client sandbox) with a specially crafted name to gain write access to any module/directory including CVSROOT. Then by modifying an existing CVSROOT administrative script or introducing a new administrative script to CVSROOT an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the server (regardless of server operating system) - including the ability to delete repository history, install a *back door*, or other additional exploit. III. Solution**Apply an update** This issue is addressed in CVS Suite 2008 Build 3736 and CVS Suite 2009 Build 3729 (and higher), which modifies the way CVSNT handles branch names and Access Control Lists. Customers with an active software maintenance contract may download the update from [the customer area](http://march-hare.com/webtools/customer/) of the march-hare.com web site. CVSNT 2.5.04 build 2862 and later (including CVSNT 2.5.05) are not vulnerable because the ACL code was rewritten when XML processing was changed from expat to libxml2 2.6.2x (compatible libxml2 libraries are shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Solaris 10). CVSNT source code for 2.5.05 and 2.5.04 may be downloaded from [the download page](http://march-hare.com/downloads/index.aspx) of the march-hare.com web site.  **Use a chroot jail with CVSNT on Linux/Unix**  March Hare Software has published [more information](http://march-hare.com/cvspro/security.htm#jail) on chroot jail as a mitigation for this vulnerability or exposure.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2108-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Sébastien Delafond

Package        : cvsnt
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2010-1326
Debian Bug     : 593884

It has been discovered that in cvsnt, a multi-platform version of the
original source code versioning system CVS, an error in the
authentication code allows a malicious, unprivileged user, through the
use of a specially crafted branch name, to gain write access to any
module or directory, including CVSROOT itself. The attacker can then
execute arbitrary code as root by modifying or adding administrative
scripts in that directory.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.03.2382-3.3+lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cvsnt package.

Upgrade instructions
- ---------------------

wget url
will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
