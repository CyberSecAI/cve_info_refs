Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1326:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an error in how CVSNT handles branch name Access Control Lists (ACLs). Specifically, the `perms.cpp` file incorrectly used the branch name as a group name during authentication checks, leading to a bypass of the intended permission system. This incorrect implementation meant that the software was creating bogus groups when checking permissions, which broke inheritance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect ACL Handling:** The core issue is the flawed logic in `perms.cpp` that misinterprets branch names as group names when evaluating ACLs. This resulted in incorrect permission checks based on branch names.
*   **Permission Bypass:** The incorrect handling of ACLs allowed unprivileged users to bypass intended access controls.
*   **Incorrect Inheritance:** Due to the incorrect group handling, the inheritance logic for ACLs was broken, further contributing to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the permission bypass, a remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain write access to any module or directory, including CVSROOT. This access allows the attacker to modify existing or introduce new administrative scripts within CVSROOT. These scripts can then be used to execute arbitrary code on the server with root privileges.
*   **Repository Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially delete repository history, install backdoors, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Because the vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution as root, the entire system is at risk of complete compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Branch Names:** The primary attack vector involves creating a branch with a specifically crafted name designed to bypass the flawed ACL checks.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker doesn't need physical access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CVSNT server.
*   **CVS Client:** The attacker needs a standard CVS client capable of creating branches.
*   **No prior authentication:** The attacker does not need prior authentication, as an unprivileged user can perform the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of CVSNT, as indicated in the CVE description and the provided documents.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by correcting the ACL logic and properly using user names instead of branch names when performing ACL checks.
*   The fix for the vulnerability included changes to the `perms.cpp` file, as shown in the provided diff.
*   Mitigation strategies involved updating to patched versions of the software or using a chroot jail with CVSNT on Linux/Unix systems as an interim step.
*   The vendor, March Hare Software, acknowledged the vulnerability and released updated software to address the issue.
