{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `spamass-milter` plugin uses the `popen()` function with unsanitized input from the `RCPT TO` field when the `-x` (expand) flag is enabled. This allows for command injection because `popen()` executes a shell command, including user-supplied data without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Unsanitized Input",
        "Use of popen()"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary shell commands on the target system with the privileges of the user running the `spamass-milter` service (typically root if the -x option is used). This could lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, or system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based",
      "SMTP RCPT TO field"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted email message to a mail server using the vulnerable `spamass-milter` plugin with the `-x` flag enabled. They must be able to send mail to the target system. The attacker needs to craft the recipient in the RCPT TO field to include shell commands."
