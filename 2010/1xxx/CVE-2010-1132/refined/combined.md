How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Thanks for the report; this is mitigated a bit on Debian, as the
default configuration doesn't use -x, nor does it run as root, but we
should definetly get a fix for it out.

I'll see what I can whip up in the next few days if the upstream
maintainers don't respond.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Mon 19 Apr 2010 08:45:01 PM UTC, comment #10:](#comment10) Quote  The preliminary patch has a major flaw: it does not reap any of the child processes it creates, resulting in a new zombie sendmail process for each call to popenv(). This eventually results in resource starvation and the milter rejecting emails due to being unable to fork or create a new thread.   Ref:  <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/583523>  <http://bugs.debian.org/575019>   I have attached a revised patch to *[Bug #29326](/bugs/?29326)* that adds an additional parameter to popenv() to return the PID of the child process, enabling the caller to use waitpid() when closing the pipe and avoid the zombie processes. This patch is based on the one from Bjørn Mork in the Debian bug report. | [Paul Howarth <pghmcfc>](/users/pghmcfc) |

| [Wed 17 Mar 2010 04:23:00 PM UTC, comment #8:](#comment8) Quote  when this bug gets fixed , there should be a release update  to make clear that this got fixed, also other patches  i.e. smtp auth should be included too then | [Robert Schetterer <rschetterer>](/users/rschetterer) |
| [Tue 16 Mar 2010 08:36:48 PM UTC, comment #7:](#comment7) Quote  Spam bucket works too with the patch.   I think it's worth updating the docs to mention that the milter must be run as root to use the -x option. | [Paul Howarth <pghmcfc>](/users/pghmcfc) |
| [Tue 16 Mar 2010 05:20:55 PM UTC, comment #6:](#comment6) Quote  Patch looks reasonable, but needs a function prototype adding for popenv() above where it's called in main().   I had to hack my initscript a bit to get the milter to run as root so that I could test out -u -x (-x only works if the milter runs as root). I also had to tweak the sample exploit slightly to get it past sendmail, which rejects the "|" exploit with a "Cannot mail directly to programs" error. And finally, I had to turn off SELinux enforcing mode to be able to write to /tmp, which would otherwise be blocked by SELinux policy, at least in current Fedora releases.   Instead of:  rcpt to: root+:"|touch /tmp/foo"   I used:  rcpt to: root+" ; touch /tmp/foo ; echo "   Without the patch, this created /tmp/foo; with the patch, it didn't. Normal mail delivery is working fine but I'm still awaiting a spam mail to check that the spambucket still works (going home now so will report back later). | [Paul Howarth <pghmcfc>](/users/pghmcfc) |
| [Wed 10 Mar 2010 06:59:07 PM UTC, comment #5:](#comment5) Quote  preliminary patch attached.  I don't use -r -b or -u -x myself so I'll need to set it up on a test box to make sure it works.

I like the popenv() approach though. | [Paul Howarth <pghmcfc>](/users/pghmcfc) |
| [Wed 10 Mar 2010 06:02:34 PM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3) Quote  Bah.    popen is actually used twice, once in read mode (to expand the -x address), and once in write mode (for the spam bucket option).  I'll add a popenv function (taking an argv array like execv), which will minimize the diff. | [Dan Nelson <dnelson>](/users/dnelson) Group administrator |

Package        : spamass-milter
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : none assigned yet
Debian Bug     : 573228

It was discovered a missing input sanitization in spamass-milter, a milter
used to filter mail through spamassassin.
This allows a remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-10 10:55:37 UTC  ``` Security researcher called "Kingcope" pointed out:   [1] <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-March/073489.html>  a deficiency in the way Mail Filter plugin for the SpamAssassin spam filter sanitized certain mail header field, when spamass-milter was run with the expand flag (-x option). If a remote attacker sent email message with certain, specially-crafted mail header field, and this message was subsequently processed by the SpamAssassin Mail Filter plugin, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the privileged system user (root).  Preliminary upstream patch:   [2] <http://savannah.nongnu.org/support/download.php?file_id=19902>  References:   [3] <http://secunia.com/advisories/38840/>   [4] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=573228>  CVE Request:   [5] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/03/10/2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-10 11:05:42 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the spamass-milter package, as shipped with Fedora releases of 11 and 12, and as shipped within EPEL4 and EPEL5 repositories.  Please fix once upstream patch for this deficiency is available.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c3)  Paul Howarth    2010-03-10 11:59:43 UTC  ``` This issue is mitigated somewhat in the Fedora/EPEL packages by the facts that (a) the milter runs as its own UID, "sa-milt", and (b) the problematic "-x" option is not the default configuration.  Since the last change in upstream CVS was in July 2006, I'll work on a patch myself and attach it to the upstream bug report:  <http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?29136>  I'll also consult with the debian maintainer.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c4)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2010-03-18 01:27:19 UTC  ``` Paul, just to be clear, 'mitigated somewhat' means that the normal configuration is immune to the associated attack because '-x' is not used?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c5)  Paul Howarth    2010-03-18 07:34:09 UTC  ``` Yes, that's right. In fact, for -x to be used, the milter would have to run as root because it uses "sendmail -bv" to expand aliases, and that only works when run as root. The current initscript for spamass-milter runs the milter as account "sa-milt" and would have to be hacked to enable it to run as root (I will add a facility to do this, with an appropriate warning, in the next release).  Furthermore, users running with SELinux enabled would have only limited exposure because the milter is confined and cannot for instance write to /tmp. It's probably limited to writing to /var/{lib,run}/spamass-milter in fact.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-03-18 12:58:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 401011](attachment.cgi?id=401011&action=diff "Local copy of preliminary upstream patch Paul is currently testing") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=401011&action=edit "Local copy of preliminary upstream patch Paul is currently testing") Local copy of preliminary upstream patch Paul is currently testing   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c7)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-22 20:46:11 UTC  ``` spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.fc13>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c8)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-22 20:46:25 UTC  ``` spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.fc12>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c9)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-22 20:59:13 UTC  ``` spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.fc11>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c10)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-22 21:00:42 UTC  ``` spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.el5>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c11)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-22 21:01:47 UTC  ``` spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.el4 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 4. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/spamass-milter-0.3.1-17.el4>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c12)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-26 23:36:58 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 577401](show_bug.cgi?id=577401 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2010-1132 spamass-milter: remote command execution") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=572117#c13)  Fedora Update System    2010-04-07 22:15:43 UTC  ``` spamass-milter-0.3.1-18.el4 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 4 stable repository.

The fix is based on upstream's proposed patch from <https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?29136> but this patch has not been committed to upstream CVS, let alone become part of a new upstream release. However, I have tested it quite extensively myself and it is also included in Debian's update for this issue.  The removal of the use of popen() in spamass-milter means that the SELinux policy for the milter can be tightened: in particular, these policy rules are no longer needed and I shall suggest their removal from Fedora policy on the Fedora selinux list.  corecmd_exec_shell(spamass_milter_t) corecmd_search_bin(spamass_milter_t)  This change might not be acceptable upstream until spamass-milter upstream has released an update that removes use of popen().   ``` |  |

Logic fuckup?

seeking the nice 0days!

Software
+-+-+-+-+
Apache Spamassassin
SpamAssassin is a mail filter which attempts to identify spam using
a variety of mechanisms including text analysis, Bayesian filtering,
DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases.

SpamAssassin is a project of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).

Postfix
What is Postfix? It is Wietse Venema's mailer that started life at IBM
research as an alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program.
Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure.
The outside has a definite Sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is
completely different.

Spamassassin Milter
A little plugin for the Sendmail Milter (Mail Filter) library
that pipes all incoming mail (including things received by rmail/UUCP)
through the SpamAssassin, a highly customizable SpamFilter.

Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The Spamassassin Milter Plugin can be tricked into executing any command
as the root user remotely.
If spamass-milter is run with the expand flag (-x option) it runs a
popen() including the attacker supplied
recipient (RCPT TO).

>From spamass-milter-0.3.1 (-latest) Line 820:

//
// Gets called once for each recipient
//
// stores the first recipient in the spamassassin object and
// stores all addresses and the number thereof (some redundancy)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
