Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-1213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `importScripts` method within Web Workers handled resources from different domains. Specifically, it was discovered that `importScripts` would attempt to read and parse resources, even if those resources were not valid JavaScript. Furthermore, with the E4X feature enabled, it could parse HTML files as JavaScript source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Origin Data Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the violation of the same-origin policy. `importScripts` was able to bypass this policy by reading resources from other domains, even when those resources were not intended to be accessed this way.
*   **Incorrect Resource Parsing:** The method didn't properly validate the content type before attempting to parse it as JavaScript. This allowed an attacker to trick the method into processing non-JavaScript files like HTML.
*   **E4X Exploitation:** The use of E4X (ECMAScript for XML) allowed for HTML files to be processed as JavaScript. This was a problem as it allowed retrieval of data that was not supposed to be exposed to the context in which the script was executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Theft:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to read data from other websites, which would normally be protected by the same-origin policy. This data could include sensitive information that an attacker can use to further penetrate a user's privacy or access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Workers:** The attack vector is through the `importScripts` method of Web Workers.
*   **Cross-Domain Request:** The vulnerability allows for a script to make a cross-domain request to a victim's site. This was done through a specially crafted web page.
*   **E4X Parsing:** The vulnerability relies on E4X to interpret HTML as JavaScript, which results in the exposure of the contents of the HTML page to the attacker's domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Web Worker API:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the Web Worker API and specifically the `importScripts` method.
*   **Ability to Create a Malicious Web Page:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page with a web worker that uses `importScripts` to target a vulnerable site.
*   **Targeted Website:** An attacker needs a targeted website with content to be stolen. This content could be accessed by a web worker.

**Additional Details:**
*   The bug report mentions a proof-of-concept (PoC) at `http://openmya.hacker.jp/hasegawa/PoC/webworker.html`, which demonstrates the vulnerability.
*   The issue was fixed by always rejecting non-JavaScript sources when using `importScripts`. The fix was a single line change that was included into the code base.
*   The fix was included in Firefox 3.5.11, Firefox 3.6.7, SeaMonkey 2.0.6, Thunderbird 3.0.6, and Thunderbird 3.1.1.
*   The bug was categorized as high severity.
