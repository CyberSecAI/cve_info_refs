**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1374

**Vulnerability:** Directory Traversal in iChat

**Affected Software:** Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.3, Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.3

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how iChat handles inline image transfers, specifically with AIM. There is a lack of proper path sanitization and validation of file paths.

**Weakness:**
*   Directory traversal vulnerability exists due to improper handling of file paths during inline image transfers in iChat.

**Impact:** A remote user can upload files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem of a user currently using AIM in iChat. This could lead to the attacker overwriting existing files, or placing malicious executables in accessible locations, which can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vector:** A remote user sends an inline image transfer through AIM using iChat. The crafted image transfer contains malicious pathing information.

**Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a remote user able to communicate with the victim through AIM. They need to send a specially crafted inline image transfer.
