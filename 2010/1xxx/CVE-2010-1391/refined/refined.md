  "CVE-2010-1391": {
    "Description": "A path traversal issue exists in WebKit's support for Local Storage and Web SQL databases. If accessed from an application-defined scheme containing '%2f' (/) or '%5c' (\\) and '..' in the host section of the URL, a maliciously crafted website may cause database files to be created outside of the designated directory. This issue is addressed by encoding characters that may have special meaning in pathnames. This issue does not affect sites served from http: or https: schemes.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Path traversal vulnerability in WebKit's support for Local Storage and Web SQL databases due to insufficient encoding of special characters in pathnames.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Path traversal"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A maliciously crafted website may cause files to be created in arbitrary user-writable locations.",
    "Attack vectors": "Visiting a malicious website with an application-defined scheme containing '%2f' (/) or '%5c' (\\) and '..' in the host section of the URL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website that can be visited by the victim's browser."
