How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## VMSA-2010-0014.1

### VMware Workstation, Player, and ACE address several security issues.

##### VMware Security Advisory

#####

VMware Security Advisory Advisory ID:VMSA-2010-0014.1VMware Security Advisory Synopsis:VMware Workstation, Player, and ACE address several security issues.VMware Security Advisory Issue date:2010-09-23VMware Security Advisory Updated on:2011-09-19VMware Security Advisory CVE numbers:
CVE-2010-3277 CVE-2010-1205 CVE-2010-0205 CVE-2010-2249 CVE-2010-0434 CVE-2010-0425

##### 1. Summary

VMware Workstation and Player address a potential installer security issue and security issues in libpng. VMware ACE Management Server (AMS) for Windows updates Apache httpd.

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware Workstation 7.1.1 and earlier,

VMware Workstation 6.5.4 and earlier,

VMware Player 3.1.1 and earlier,

VMware Player 2.5.4 and earlier,

VMware ACE Management Server 2.7.1 and earlier,

Note: VMware Server was declared End Of Availability on January 2010, support will be limited to Technical Guidance for the duration of the support term.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware Workstation and Player installer security issue

The Workstation 7.x and Player 3.x installers will load an index.htm file located in the current working directory on which Workstation 7.x or Player 3.x is being installed. This may allow an attacker to display a malicious file if they manage to get their file onto the system prior to installation.
The issue can only be exploited at the time that Workstation 7.x or Player 3.x is being installed. Installed versions of Workstation and Player are not affected. The security issue is no longer present in the installer of the new versions of Workstation 7.x and Player 3.x (see table below for the version numbers).
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-3277 to this issue.
VMware would like to thank Alexander Trofimov and Marc Esher for independently reporting this issue to VMware.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

\* Note: This only affects the installer, if you have a version of Workstation or Player installed you are not vulnerable.

#####

b. Third party libpng updated to version 1.2.44

A buffer overflow condition in libpng is addressed that could potentially lead to code execution with the privileges of the application using libpng. Two potential denial of service issues are also addressed in the update.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2010-1205, CVE-2010-0205, CVE-2010-2249 to these issues.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

c. VMware ACE Management Server (AMS) for Windows updates Apache httpd

A function in Apache HTTP Server when multithreaded MPM is used does not properly handle headers in subrequests in certain circumstances which may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted request that triggers access to memory locations associated with an earlier request.
The Apache mod\_isapi module can be forced to unload a specific library before the processing of a request is complete, resulting in memory corruption. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2010-0434 and CVE-2010-0425 to the issues addressed in this update.
Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A stack buffer overlow exists in Apple Type Services' handling of embedded fonts. Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded font may lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-1800

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: CFNetwork permits anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue does not affect the Mail application. This issue is addressed by disabling anonymous TLS/SSL connections. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6.3. Credit to Aaron Sigel of vtty.com, Jean-Luc Giraud of Citrix, Tomas Bjurman of Sirius IT, and Wan-Teh Chang of Google, Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **ClamAV**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0098, CVE-2010-1311

  Available for: Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in ClamAV

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues by updating ClamAV to version 0.96.1.

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.4, Mac OS X Server v10.6.4

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position who can obtain a domain name that differs only in the last characters from the name of a legitimate domain may impersonate hosts in that domain

  Description: An issue exists in the handling of certificate host names. For host names containing three or more components, the last characters are not properly compared. In the case of a name containing exactly three components, only the last character is not checked. For example, if an attacker in a privileged network position could obtain a certificate for www.example.con the attacker can impersonate www.example.com. This issue is addressed through improved handling of certificate host names. Credit to Peter Speck for reporting this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    application crash) via a PNG image containing malformed Physical
    Scale (aka sCAL) chunks

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny4.

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, these
problems have been fixed in version 1.2.44-1

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng package.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java was updated to 1.4.2 FP5, fixing various bugs and security issues:
CVE-2010-0084: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update
23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via
unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0085: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0
Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0087: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Web Start, Java
Plug-in component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18,
5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0088: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0
Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect
confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0089: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Web Start, Java
Plug-in component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18,
5.0 Update 23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect availability
via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0091: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update
23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via
unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0095: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update
23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0839: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-0840: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update
23, and 1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality,
integrity, and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous
information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not
commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is related to
improper checks when executing privileged methods in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE), which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
via (1) an untrusted object that extends the trusted class but has not
modified a certain method, or (2) "a similar trust issue with interfaces,"
aka "Trusted Methods Chaining Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."
CVE-2010-0841: Unspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, and
1.4.2\_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow in the Java
Runtime Environment that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a JPEG image that contains subsample dimensions with large values,
related to JPEGImageReader and "stepX".
CVE-2010-0842: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is an uncontrolled array index that
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MIDI file with
a crafted MixerSequencer object, related to the GM\_Song structure.
CVE-2010-0843: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on
claims from a reliable researcher that this is related to XNewPtr and
improper handling of an integer parameter when allocating heap memory
in the com.sun.media.sound libraries, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2010-0844: Unspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle
Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25, and
1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information
was obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is for improper parsing of a crafted
MIDI stream when creating a MixerSequencer object, which causes a pointer
to be corrupted and allows a NULL byte to be written to arbitrary memory.
CVE-2010-0846: Unspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25,
and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow
that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, related to an
"invalid assignment" and inconsistent length values in a JPEG image
encoder (JPEGImageEncoderImpl).
CVE-2010-0847: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java 2D component in
Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2\_25,
and 1.3.1\_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity,
and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was
obtained from the March 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims
from a reliable researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow
that allows arbitrary code execution via a crafted image.
CVE-2010-0848: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java 2D component in

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

=== Content from www.libpng.org_5ef8f8d2_20250125_230138.html ===


| **libpng** |
| --- |

**libpng** is the official PNG reference library. It supports almost
all PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for
over 29 years. The home site for development versions (i.e., may be

buggy or subject to change or include experimental features) is [https://libpng.sourceforge.io/](https://libpng.sourceforge.io/index.html), and
the place to go for questions about the library is the [**png-mng-implement**](pngmisc.html#lists) mailing list.

libpng is available as ANSI C (C89) source code and requires **zlib 1.0.4**
or later (**1.2.13** or later recommended for performance and security
reasons). The current public release, **libpng 1.6.45**, includes minor
fixes and improvements:

* Hardened calculations in chroma handling to prevent overflows, and relaxed a constraint in cHRM validation to accomodate the standard ACES AP1 set of color primaries. (Contributed by John Bowler)* Removed the ASM implementation of ARM Neon optimizations and updated the build accordingly. Only the remaining C implementation shall be used from now on, thus ensuring the support of the PAC/BTI security features on ARM64. (Contributed by Ross Burton and John Bowler)* Fixed the pickup of the PNG\_HARDWARE\_OPTIMIZATIONS option in the CMake build on FreeBSD/amd64. This is an important performance fix on this platform.* Applied various fixes and improvements to the CMake build. (Contributed by Eric Riff, Benjamin Buch and Erik Scholz)* Added fuzzing targets for the simplified read API. (Contributed by Mikhail Khachayants)* Fixed a build error involving pngtest.c under a custom config. This was a regression introduced in a code cleanup in libpng-1.6.43. (Contributed by Ben Wagner)* Fixed and improved the config files for AppVeyor CI and Travis CI.

| | **Portability Note** The libpng  1.6.x  series continues the evolution of the libpng API, finally **hiding the contents** of the venerable and hoary **png\_struct** and **png\_info** data structures inside **private (i.e., non-installed) header files**. Instead of direct struct-access, applications should be using the various png\_get\_xxx() and png\_set\_xxx() accessor functions, which have existed for almost as long as libpng itself. libpng 1.8.x is now under development and will eliminate some long-deprecated APIs and "features," potentially breaking compatibility with very old apps. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

The portability notice should not come as a particular surprise
to anyone who has added libpng support to an application this millenium; the
manual has warned of it since at least July 2000. (Specifically:
*"Starting with version 2.0.0, both structures are going to be hidden, and
the contents of the structures will only be accessible through the
png\_get/png\_set functions."* OK, so the version number was off a
bit...and the grammar, too, but who's counting?) Those whose apps depend on
the older API need not panic, however (for now); libpng 1.2.x continues to
get security fixes, as has 1.0.x for well over a decade. (Greg no longer
bothers to list either series here; enough's enough, folks. Update those
apps now!)

The 1.5.x and later series also include a new, more thorough test program
(pngvalid.c) and a new pnglibconf.h header file that
tracks what features were enabled or disabled when libpng was built. On
the other hand, they no longer internally include the zlib.h header
file, so applications that formerly depended on png.h to provide
that will now need to include it explicitly.
Complete differences relative to libpng 1.4.x
are detailed [here](src/libpng-1.4.x-to-1.5.x-summary.txt).

See the bottom of this page for warnings about

**security and crash bugs**
in versions up through **libpng 1.6.36**.

In addition to the main library sources,
all of the 1.2.x/1.4.x/1.5.x/1.6.x/1.7.x series include
the [rpng, rpng2 and wpng](book/sources.html) demo programs,
the pngminus demo program, a subset of Willem van Schaik's
[PngSuite test images](http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/),
and Willem's VisualPng demo program.

### Security and Crash Bugs in Older Versions

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.36 and earlier have a use-after-free bug in the simplified libpng API png\_image\_free(). It has been assigned ID [CVE-2019-7317](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7317). The vulnerability is fixed in version **1.6.37**, released on 15 April 2019. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng version 1.6.31 added png\_handle\_eXIf(), which has a null-pointer-dereference bug as well as a potential memory leak. Insofar as the function has existed for only four weeks and the chunk itself for only six, it's unlikely there are any applications affected by it at this time, but they might come into existence in the future. The vulnerability is fixed in version **1.6.32**, released on 24 August 2017. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.26, 1.5.27, 1.4.19, 1.2.56, and 1.0.66, respectively, have a null-pointer-dereference bug in png\_set\_text\_2() when an image-editing application adds, removes, and re-adds text chunks to a PNG image. (This bug does *not* affect pure viewers, nor are there any known editors that could trigger it without interactive user input. It has been assigned ID [CVE-2016-10087](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10087).) The vulnerability is fixed in versions **1.6.27**, **1.5.28**, **1.4.20**, **1.2.57**, and **1.0.67**, released on 29 December 2016. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all **old-branch** libpng versions through 1.5.25, 1.4.18, 1.2.55, and 1.0.65, respectively, have a potential out-of-bounds read in png\_check\_keyword(), which has been assigned ID [CVE-2015-8540](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8540)). The vulnerability is fixed in versions **1.5.26**, **1.4.19**, **1.2.56**, and **1.0.66**, released on 17 December 2015.  The current branch (1.6.x) is *not* vulnerable to this bug. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.19, 1.5.24, 1.4.17, 1.2.54, and 1.0.64, respectively, have a potential pointer overflow/underflow in png\_handle\_sPLT()/png\_handle\_pCAL() (and in png\_handle\_iTXt()/png\_handle\_zTXt() in the pre-1.6 branches), and all such versions likewise have a bug in their png\_set\_PLTE() implementations that left it open to the out-of-bounds write ([CVE-2015-8126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126)) that was supposed to have been fixed in the previous release. The bugs are fixed in versions **1.6.20**, **1.5.25**, **1.4.18**, **1.2.55**, and **1.0.65**, released on 3 December 2015. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.18, 1.5.23, 1.4.16, 1.2.53, and 1.0.63, respectively, have a potential out-of-bounds read in png\_set\_tIME()/png\_convert\_to\_rfc1123() and an out-of-bounds write in png\_get\_PLTE()/png\_set\_PLTE(). The former vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2015-7981](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7981) and the latter [CVE-2015-8126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126). The first is fixed in versions **1.6.19**, **1.5.24**, **1.4.17**, **1.2.54**, and **1.0.64**, released on 12 November 2015; see the subsequent vulnerability warning for info about the latter fix. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.9 through 1.6.15 (and some subset of versions up through 1.5.20) have an integer-overflow vulnerability in png\_combine\_row() when decoding very wide interlaced images, which can allow an attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of memory with arbitrary (attacker-controlled) data. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2014-9495](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9495) and is fixed in versions **1.6.16** and **1.5.21**, released on 21 December 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.14, 1.5.19, 1.4.13, 1.2.51, and 1.0.61, respectively, have an out-of-bounds memory access in png\_user\_version\_check(). It is unclear whether this could lead to an actual exploit. The bug is fixed in versions **1.6.15**, **1.5.20**, etc., released on 20 November 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.9 hang when reading images that have zero-length IDAT chunks with the progressive (streaming) reader; a malicious web site could use this bug to cause a (minor) denial of service. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2014-0333](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0333) and is fixed in version **1.6.10**, released 6 March 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.1 through 1.6.7 fail to reject colormapped images with empty palettes, leading to a null-pointer dereference (crash) in png\_do\_expand\_palette(). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2013-6954](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6954) and is fixed in version **1.6.8**, released 19 December 2013. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Various versions of libpng through 1.5.11, 1.4.11, 1.2.49, and 1.0.59, respectively, set the top-level archive-extraction directory's permissions to be world-writable as part of the distcheck Makefile target's operations (configure-generated Makefile only). This could allow a local attacker on the build host to silently replace the extracted libpng library with a malicious version, conceivably poisoning an official binary distribution of libpng (though the likelihood of this seems remote), but more generally allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the user running make. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2012-3386](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3386) and is fixed in version **1.5.12** (and versions **1.4.12**, **1.2.50**, and **1.0.60**, respectively, on the older branches), released 10 July 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All "modern" versions of libpng through 1.5.9, 1.4.10, 1.2.48, and 1.0.58, respectively, fail to correctly handle malloc() failure for text chunks (in png\_set\_text\_2()), which can lead to memory corruption and the possibility of execution of hostile code. This **serious vulnerability** has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3048](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3048) and is fixed in version **1.5.10** (and versions **1.4.11**, **1.2.49**, and **1.0.59**, respectively, on the older branches), released 29 March 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 1.0.6 through 1.5.8, 1.4.8, 1.2.46, and 1.0.56, respectively, fail to correctly validate a heap allocation in png\_decompress\_chunk(), which can lead to a buffer-overrun and the possibility of execution of hostile code on 32-bit systems. This **serious vulnerability** has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3026](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3026) and is fixed in version **1.5.9** (and versions **1.4.9**, **1.2.47**, and **1.0.57**, respectively, on the older branches), released 18 February 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.4 through 1.5.7 contain a one-byte (stack) buffer-overrun bug in png\_formatted\_warning(), which could lead to crashes (denial of service) or, conceivably, execution of hostile code. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3464](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3464) and is fixed in version **1.5.8**, released 1 February 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.4 (only) introduced a divide-by-zero bug in png\_handle\_cHRM(), which could lead to crashes (denial of service) in applications that support color correction. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3328](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3328) ([CERT VU#477046](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/477046)) and is fixed in version **1.5.5**, released 22 September 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All released versions of libpng (from 1.0 onward) have a buffer overrun in the code that promotes palette images with transparency (1 channel) to grayscale+alpha images (2 channels), but only for applications that call png\_rgb\_to\_gray() and not png\_set\_expand(). (None are known.) An arbitrary amount of memory may be overwritten in this case, with arbitrary (attacker-controlled) data. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2690](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2690).  libpng 1.2.20 and later crashes in png\_default\_error() due to internal use of a NULL pointer instead of the empty string (""). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2691](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2691).  Many (most?) versions of libpng read uninitialized memory when handling empty sCAL chunks, and they handle malformed sCAL chunks (those lacking a delimiting NULL between the internal strings) incorrectly. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2692](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2692).  All of these issues are fixed in version **1.5.4** (as well as **1.4.8**, **1.2.45**, and **1.0.55** on the older branches), released 7 July 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.0 (only) introduced a bug in the RGB-to-grayscale transform code, which can lead to buffer overruns due to incorrect calculation of the number of bytes per pixel. (Since 1.5.0 was just released, no apps or OS distributions are believed to ship with it, so the risk should be minimal.) This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-0408](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0408) ([CERT VU#643140](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/643140)) and is fixed in version **1.5.1**, released 3 February 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Several versions of libpng through 1.4.2 (and through 1.2.43 in the older series) contain a bug whereby progressive applications such as web browsers (or the rpng2 demo app included in libpng) could receive an extra row of image data beyond the height reported in the header, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write to memory (depending on how the application is written) and the possibility of execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2010-1205](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1205) (via Mozilla). An additional memory-leak bug, involving images with malformed sCAL chunks, is also present; it could lead to an application crash (denial of service) when viewing such images. Both bugs are fixed in versions **1.4.3** and **1.2.44**, released 25 June 2010. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Jeff Phillips reported that several versions of libpng through 1.2.35 contain an uninitialized-memory-read bug that may have security implications. Specifically, 1-bit (2-color) interlaced images whose widths are not divisible by 8 may result in several uninitialized bits at the end of certain rows in certain interlace passes being returned to the user. An application that failed to mask these out-of-bounds pixels might display or process them, albeit presumably with benign results in most cases. This bug may be fixed in version **1.2.36**, released 7 May 2009, but the correct fix is in version **1.2.37**, released 4 June 2009. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 0.89c through 1.2.34 contain an uninitialized-data bug that can be triggered by a malicious user. Specifically, there are several instances in which a malloc'd array of pointers is then initialized by a secondary sequence of malloc() calls. If one of these calls fails, libpng's cleanup routine will attempt to free the entire array, including any uninitialized pointers, which could lead to execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2009-0040](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0040) and is fixed in version **1.2.35**, released 18 February 2009. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.2.30 and 1.2.31 of libpng can crash when reading images with multiple zTXt chunks; it is likely that this vulnerability could lead to a remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2008-3964](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3964) and is fixed in version **1.2.32**, released 18 September 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 1.0.6 through 1.2.26 have a bug when handling unknown (to libpng) chunks with zero data length. Applications that call either png\_set\_read\_user\_chunk\_fn() or png\_set\_keep\_unknown\_chunks(), when used with standard builds of libpng (i.e., built with either PNG\_READ\_UNKNOWN\_CHUNKS\_SUPPORTED or PNG\_READ\_USER\_CHUNKS\_SUPPORTED defined), can crash when attempting to free a non-existent data buffer for the unknown chunk. The **pngtest** sample application distributed with libpng, **pngcrush**, and certain versions of **ImageMagick** are known to be affected, but the bug is otherwise believed to be quite rare. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2008-1382](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1382) and is fixed in version **1.2.27**, released 28 April 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Crash Warning** Most versions of libpng up through 1.2.24 have a number of minor coding errors that could lead to crashes in exceptional cases. For example, if memory allocation fails while processing certain ancillary chunks, libpng could crash while attempting to write to the NULL pointer; or if the application author failed to set up the info\_ptr as required, some parts of libpng fail to check for NULL and could crash trying to read the pointer (though it's probable that the error would have caused libpng to terminate upstream of these parts). The bugs are fixed in version **1.2.25**, released 18 February 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Version 1.2.21 has a crash bug when reading the ICC-profile chunk, iCCP ([CVE-2007-5267](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5267)). This bug is fixed in version **1.2.22**, released 13 October 2007. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.2.20 and earlier have a number of potential crash-bugs due to out-of-bounds reads in certain chunk-handlers; MITRE has collectively assigned them the identifiers [CVE-2007-5266](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5266), [CVE-2007-5268](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5268) and [CVE-2007-5269](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5269). These bugs are fixed in version **1.2.21**, released 4 October 2007, but another crash bug (related to the ICC-profile chunk) remains to be fixed in version **1.2.22**. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions up through 1.2.16 (and 1.0.24) have an NULL-pointer-dereference vulnerability involving palette images with a malformed tRNS chunk (i.e., one with a bad CRC value). This bug can, at a minimum, cause crashes in browsers simply by visiting a page displaying such an image; reportedly it also crashes the Microsoft Windows display manager. CERT refers to it as [VU#684664](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/684664) and MITRE as [CVE-2007-2445](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2445). It's fixed in versions **libpng 1.2.18** and **libpng 1.0.26** (also **1.2.17** and **1.0.25**, which had a bug in their configure scripts), released 15 May 2007. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.0.6 through 1.2.12 and 1.0.20 have a bug in the decoder for the sPLT ("suggested palette") chunk; this can lead to crashes and, accordingly, a denial of service (e.g., crashing your browser when you visit a site displaying a specially crafted PNG). The bug is fixed in **libpng 1.2.13** and **libpng 1.0.21**, released 15 November 2006. MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-5793](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5793). The same releases also include fixes for a specific class of application error (NULL png\_ptr) and for a bug in the code that *writes* the iCCP ("ICC profile") chunk. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions up through 1.2.11 and 1.0.19 have a buffer-overrun vulnerability when a particular error message is triggered. The overrun is always by exactly two bytes ('k' and NULL) so it seems highly unlikely that it could be used for anything more nefarious than denial of service (e.g., crashing your browser when you visit a site displaying a specially crafted PNG). Nevertheless, it's worth fixing, and versions **libpng 1.2.12** and **libpng 1.0.20**, released 27 June 2006, do just that. (Note that 1.2.11 and 1.0.19 erroneously claimed to include the fix, but in fact it had been inadvertently omitted.) MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-3334](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3334). The same releases (and their immediate predecessors) also fix an out-of-bounds (by one) memory read and a second buffer overrun, this one in the code that *writes* the sCAL ("physical scale of subject") chunk (which is rather rare in any case). | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

There have been other issues in older versions released in 2004:

| | **Crash Warning** Versions 1.2.7, 1.2.6, 1.0.17, and 1.0.16 have a bug that will cause applications that strip the alpha channel (while reading a PNG) to crash. The bug is fixed in versions **1.2.8** and **1.0.18**, which were released on 3 December 2004. MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-0481](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0481). | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

The release before that fixed another bug, this one in the PNG-writing code:

| | **Broken-Image Warning** Versions 1.2.6 and 1.0.16 can write an invalid zlib header within the PNG datastream. This is not quite as bad as it sounds since the two-byte header can be corrected fairly easily (e.g., use [pngcrush](http://pmt.sf.net/pngcrush/) to rewrite the images and, perhaps, compress them slightly better, or run the *png-fix-IDAT-windowsize* utility bundled with [pngcheck](apps/pngcheck.html) 2.1.0 or later), but some applications will display the images incorrectly. Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer are known to be affected. A [libpng patch](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.2.6-patch-pngwutil.txt) is available, and versions **1.2.7** and **1.0.17** (incorporating the fix) were released on 11 September 2004. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

Finally--and most important--there were several security vulnerabilities
present in versions of libpng prior to 1.2.6 and 1.0.16, one of which is
**quite dangerous**:

| | **Vulnerability Warning** On 4 August 2004 a new **jumbo security patch** was released to address several potential vulnerabilities in libpng, at least one of which is *quite serious*. It was followed on 15 August by the full **libpng 1.2.6** and **libpng 1.0.16** releases, which, like subsequent releases, incorporate the fix.

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.427.0 Safari/534.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.3a5pre) Gecko/20100606 Minefield/3.7a5pre
A segmentation fault occurs when the mentioned image is opened in x86 Ubuntu 10.04 using either the default version of Firefox or the current nightly build. The error occurs in gfxASurface::SurfaceDestroyFunc.
The backtrace from the nightly build is:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00d2a99b in gfxASurface::SurfaceDestroyFunc(void\*) () from ./libxul.so
(gdb) bt
#0 0x00d2a99b in gfxASurface::SurfaceDestroyFunc(void\*) () from ./libxul.so

#3 0x00d2add3 in gfxASurface::Release() () from ./libxul.so
#4 0x00000000 in ?? ()
The kinda worrysome looking 0 return address does not show up in the backtrace for default Firefox.
Not tested in 64-bit builds or other platforms yet.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
$ firefox <http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~aki/spark.png>
Actual Results:
$ firefox <http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~aki/spark.png>
Segmentation fault

Expected Results:
$ firefox <http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~aki/spark.png>

Here's the backtrace using a DEBUG build. Whatever's being handed to gfxASurface::SurfaceDestroyFunc is bogus and we're crashing when trying to delete it.

The image at <http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~aki/spark-2.png> causes a similar crash. Slightly different trace, but I'm guessing it's the same issue.

For what it's worth, my local debug builds I see crashes in various other places too (DOM code, imgFrame::EstimateMemoryUsed with |this| being jemalloc freed markers), plus assertions like so:
###!!! ASSERTION: Don't ask for a frame > 0 if we're not animated!: 'framenum == 0', file ../../../../mozilla/modules/libpr0n/src/imgContainer.cpp, line 373
When those assertions fire, framenum in imgContainer::GetImgFrame is 0xff00fffe, because numFrames is 0xff00ffff in nsPNGDecoder::EndImageFrame.
And that's because mImage.mRawPtr->mFrames.Length() is 0xff00ffff at that point (why, I have no idea).blocking2.0: --- → ?

According to "pngcrush -n -v spark.png" it has "Extra compressed data". This causes libpng-1.4 to issue two "benign errors". Such errors can be handled as warnings or (by default) as errors. Mozilla allows libpng to handle them by default.
@aki, are you using the embedded libpng or the system libpng on Ubuntu?
I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 with Firefox 3.6.3 as supplied by Ubuntu, and am not seeing a crash; I see a 2x2 green image. Same with spark-2.png except it't 1x1.

Good guess. I'm here but busy with something else. I am suspecting something is wrong with the png\_benign\_error() handling, but [comment #10](/show_bug.cgi?id=570451#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - segmentation fault when viewing a malformed PNG image") says the system libpng-1.2 is also acting up. Note that if MOZ\_PNG\_stuff is in the traceback then it is the embedded libpng, even if you requested system libpng via configure (it might have fallen back on the embedded library to get the APNG support). If both embedded and system libpng exhibit the bug, then look for a problem in libpr0n/decoders/png.

Looks like our row\_callback is being called with row\_num == mFrameRect.height (2) which causes us to write beyond the image data buffer. I'm not yet sure why libpng calls us with row\_num == 2.

Libpng's example.c contains this check at the
beginning of the row\_callback:
/\* Check if row\_num is in bounds. \*/
if ((row\_num >= 0) && (row\_num < height))
{
That check is omitted from libpng's contrib/gregbook/readpng2.c
and also from libpr0n's decoders/png/nsPNGDecoder.cpp, which
was modeled after the gregbook code.

The only rule changes we've made recently made the rules less restrictive, so if you had access before and lost it, you should file a bug to sort that out:

Shouldn't the caller of row\_callback ensure that row\_num is in bounds? row\_num >= height seems to be handle pretty inconsistently by users of libpng.
These users don't seem to check:
dillo-0.8.6/src/png.c
WebCore/platform/image-decoders/png/PNGImageDecoder.cpp
links-2.1pre14/png.c
These users check but assume or assert that the condition won't happen:
trunk/gears/base/common/png\_utils.cc
chromium/gfx/codec/png\_codec.cc
These users do the check:
gdk-pixbuf/io-png.c

I don't know why the check is in libpng/example.c but someone must
have experienced a problem or realized that a problem was possible.
A lot of applications are probably built with the gregbook code,
as is libpr0n/decoders/nsPNGDecoder.cpp, and would be vulnerable
The test was added to libpng/example.c in libpng-1.2.1beta01, in
October 2001.

The revised code for example.c, with the check for row\_num out of
bounds, was contributed by "Capt. Taura M." on 10 September 2001.
It was meant to clarify the example; there is no mention of anything
crashing, but there was a problem with reading interlaced PNGs
in The GIMP which may have been related.

I originally also opened a Chromium issue for this case, and can tell there about your findings. What about other the affected programs? Will libpng later check row\_num before calling the callback, or should the users check the validity? If the latter is the way to go, I could give the files to some friends at CERT-FI for checking if other projects or vendors are affected.

I have notified the libpng developers. As a minimum we will change the example code in contrib/gregbook/readpng2.c upon which a lot of applications seem to be based. I assume that we will fix libpng to check internally as well, if we can.
It looks as though we simply could insert a check for row\_num >= png\_ptr->height
at the entry to png\_push\_have\_row() in pngpread.c

Please test the v01 patch as well. v01 fixes the embedded libpng while v00 (still needed) makes libpr0n catch the problem when the system libpng is used. We should probably apply both.

I've pushed v00 to try. I'm not thrilled about pushing to try though because it can potentially reveal the problem, so I'm holding off pushing v01 and the combination. I think we can probably land v00 everywhere and then deal with v01 after we've done a release.

That's OK; v00 takes care of both embedded and system. The combo will be redundant when using the embedded libpng, so we might want to #ifdef out
the test in libpr0n when using the embedded libpng. But as you say, that can
wait.

Don't know. The libpng group is checking into it. The
v00 and v01 patches fix the symptoms but don't cure the
underlying problem. Hopefully we will come up with an
explanation and a real fix. If anyone here has an idea,
feel free to post it here, send it to me, or better yet
(after this bug's security flag is cleared!),
join the png-mng-implement mailing list at sourceforge
and post it there.

Let's try to get this into the branch builds ASAP since the problem is fairly obvious from the patch. Please hold off on the trunk landing for a bit and we'll try to land everywhere next week.
Or will our landing "out" the problem for every libpng using-system everywhere, not just Mozilla clients? If so we need to coordinate w/Glennblocking1.9.1: --- → ?blocking1.9.2: --- → ?

It will reveal the problem that exists in every libpng-using system that does progressive reading (i.e., using callbacks) and that follows the libpng/gregbook/readpng2.c example and not the libpng/example.c. I guess CERT should be notified right away. CERT will probably want 3 weeks before going public with the bug.

If you want to try a patched version against more similar data before
releasing:
mkdir -p $HOME/pngtest/{samples,fuzzed}
cd $HOME/pngtest
curl <http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/PngSuite.tar.gz> | tar -C samples -zxvf -
curl <http://ouspg.googlecode.com/files/radamsa-0.1.c.gz> | gzip -d | gcc -O2 -o
radamsa -x c -
./radamsa -e surfy -n 1000 -o fuzzed/%f-%i.png samples/\*.png
and then test the files coming to fuzzed/\*.png, and remove when done to get
more. For example $ for file in fuzzed/\*.png; do echo "<img src=$file>"; done >
all.html; firefox all.html. Leaving out the "-e surfy" gives more varied
changes, but that module is the one usually triggering this issue.

I've submitted a report to CERT:
An extra row of data in the IDAT chunk of a
png file can cause libpng applications that
use the progressive reader (with a row callback
function) to crash, if the row callback function
does not check for an out-of-bounds row number.
A workaround is to check for row\_num greater
than or equal to the image height, at the
beginning of the user-supplied row callback
function.
All versions of libpng are vulnerable.
Libpng versions 1.2.44 and 1.4.3 will be
released shortly. Libpng-1.0.x is no longer
supported and will not be updated.
A patch for Mozilla/firefox is being tested.

It's not yet an official upstream patch. I'm hoping to see some test
results both here and on png-mng-implement at lists.sourceforge.net
but so far have only seen results from myself and one other person.
#:-( --- but the results so far are sucessful #:-)
Let me know exactly when you plan to land a patched Firefox release;
we will no doubt be able to coordinate the release of libpng-1.4.3
at the same time, along with 1.2.44 (legacy) and 1.5.0beta29 (devel).

IE 8 on Windows did not crash
Chrome 5 on windows did crash, but Aki indicated they're ready to go with a patch too.
I think we need to land v00 everywhere now (so it makes 1.9.2.6/1.9.1.11) and upgrade libpng later.

I think libpng-1.4.3 is ready to go with v04 (with typos fixed) whenever you land v00. libpng-1.4.3 will also fix a memory leak with the sCAL chunk, that does not affect you since libimg never processes sCAL.

Uh, what? Firefox 3.6.6 doesn't include the patch for this. Unless they're using system libpng and have already patched it with the newer release, you shouldn't see this as fixed.

I guess it's possible that I'm using a patched libpng. All I know is that I received Firefox 3.6.6 from Ubuntu, and didn't see a crash. I'll check further when I get home this evening.

ldd says my firefox-3.6.6 is using libpng12.so.0.
That is linked to libpng.1.2.42, not patched.
So I don't know why I don't see the crash now.

Glenn: your system is magic. We have not released a fix for this yet. What may not be obvious from comments alone is that "fixed in 1.9.2.6" became "fixed in 1.9.2.7" when the inserted plugin-hang-fix release took the 1.9.2.6-based name (but the "status1.9.2" field was updated to reflect the correct state).

Correction, x86 crashes on load, whereas on x86\_64 Firefox seems to work after opening the images, but crashes if closed or the page is loaded a few times, apparently whenever something accesses whatever was corrupted next to the broken image.

OK, I opened spark.png ten times with no problem but on the 11th, in a new tab, it crashed.
Magic, indeed. #:-(

I should not have done that. The end result was that I've completely lost access to the ubuntu machine, except via a "generic-recovery" reboot to a CLI, or via CTRL-ALT-F1. I can't get it to give me a login prompt (just a purple screen-of-death with highlights and no login dialog box). Possibly related is that the crash happened while the update manager was trying to update sudo and some other kernel stuff, but I'm suspecting spark.png.

A pointer to spark.png has been posted to the chromium bug tracker and to the png-mng-implement mailing list. So I suppose the security flag can be cleared here.

In case it is of any help, I removed the images to which they linked a while ago. I think only this thread has a copy of the original file.

I have a copy but it is on my old Ubuntu disk. I'm back in business now;
put in a new disc and did a fresh install of Ubuntu Lucid on it. I can mount the old disc and read the files on it, but never succeeded in getting the "half-configured" gdm and gedit running again, evidently due to the nasty crash caused by this bug.
Note that I opened a separate [bug #564792](/show_bug.cgi?id=564792 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update libpng to version 1.4.3") about upgrading to libpng-1.4.3 on the trunk. For other branches, applying the v05 patch from here should be sufficient.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-41

## Remote code execution using malformed PNG image

Announced
July 20, 2010
Reporter
Aki Helin
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.11
* Firefox 3.6.7
* SeaMonkey 2.0.6
* Thunderbird 3.0.6
* Thunderbird 3.1.1

### Description

OUSPG researcher **Aki Helin** reported a buffer
overflow in Mozilla graphics code which consumes image data processed
by libpng. A malformed PNG file could be created which would cause
libpng to incorrectly report the size of the image to downstream
consumers. When the dimensions of such images are underreported, the
Mozilla code responsible for displaying the graphic will allocate too
small a memory buffer to contain the image data and will wind up
writing data past the end of the buffer. This could result in the
execution of attacker-controlled memory.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=608238#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2010-06-26 09:39:51 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>  Several versions of libpng through 1.4.2 (and through 1.2.43 in the older series) contain a bug whereby progressive applications such as web browsers (or the rpng2 demo app included in libpng) could receive an extra row of image data beyond the height reported in the header, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write to memory (depending on how the application is written) and the possibility of execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2010-1205](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-1205)  (via Mozilla).  An additional memory-leak bug, involving images with malformed sCAL chunks, is also present; it could lead to an application crash (denial of service) when viewing such images.     Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.    Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=608238#c1)  Tom Lane    2010-06-26 12:27:05 UTC  ``` If memory serves, firefox is still getting built with its own private copy of libpng, so they;re going to need a separate patch for this.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=608238#c2)  Glenn Randers-Pehrson    2010-06-26 15:28:08 UTC  ``` Yes, mozilla/firefox by default uses a private copy of libpng.  A workaround for this bug was checked in yesterday, for mozilla 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and trunk.  Mozilla/firefox is not vulnerable to the sCAL memory leak.  Libpng-1.4.3 was released last night to address both bugs.  Regards, Glenn Randers-Pehrson, PNG/MNG Development Group   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=608238#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-28 11:40:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=608238#c0)) > An additional memory-leak bug, involving images with malformed sCAL chunks, is > also present; it could lead to an application crash (denial of service) when > viewing such images.
