- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in HP Insight Control server migration for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Remote Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability could be exploited remotely. The specific impacts of the XSS vulnerability are not detailed beyond the potential for remote exploitation, but generally XSS vulnerabilities can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable application. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites, among other potential impacts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication (Au:N) to exploit this vulnerability and the attack complexity is low (AC:L). The attacker needs to inject malicious script into a web page and then induce a user to interact with the crafted page.
