Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2010-1685 (Implicitly, based on the content being a vulnerability disclosure for ZipWrangler 1.2).
*   **Product:** ZipWrangler
*   **Version:** 1.2
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Stack buffer overflow
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly handle overly long ZIP filenames, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation when handling zip filenames, which allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer size for filename storage on the stack.
*   **Impact:** By overwriting the Stack Exception Handler (SEH), an attacker can gain complete control of the application's execution flow, allowing them to inject and execute arbitrary code on the machine. The attacker gains the same privileges as the user running the application.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious ZIP file with an excessively long filename.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious ZIP file and have the victim open it with the vulnerable ZipWrangler application.
*   **Exploitation:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious zip file with an overly long filename, which will overflow the stack buffer when processed by the application, allowing to overwrite the SEH and control execution.
*   **Severity:**  The advisory rates this as a high-risk vulnerability.
*   **Vendor Communication:**  The vendor was contacted but did not respond, leading to public disclosure.
*  **Affected platform:** Windows (Tested on XP SP3)

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by TecR0c.
