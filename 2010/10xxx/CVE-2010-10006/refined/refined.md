Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the commit message "fix timing vulnerability."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The original code used `String.equals()` to compare the signature (`sig`) with the computed HMAC (`hmac`). The `String.equals()` method is known to have a timing vulnerability. The comparison operation exits early when a mismatch is found, making it vulnerable to timing attacks. This allows an attacker to guess the correct signature byte-by-byte.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing vulnerability:** The original use of `String.equals()` for signature verification allowed an attacker to potentially determine the correct signature by observing the time taken to perform the comparison.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication bypass:** If an attacker can successfully guess the signature, they could bypass authentication mechanisms that rely on the validity of the signature. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system/application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Timing attack:** The attacker observes the time taken by the server to compare the signature against the computed hash. Variations in execution time, due to early exit when a mismatch is found, leak information about signature characters. Repeated requests and observation of response time would allow for byte by byte signature character guessing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server that include a signature.
- The attacker needs the ability to measure the response time for these requests with reasonable accuracy.

**Changes Made:**
The code was changed to use `safeEquals` which performs a character by character comparison which ensures the comparison is done even if a mismatch is found and then returns a boolean comparison result.

```java
boolean safeEquals(String s1, String s2) {
    if (s1.length()!=s2.length())
        return false;
    int result = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<s1.length(); i++) {
        int c1 = s1.charAt(i);
        int c2 = s2.charAt(i);
        result |= (c1 ^c2);
    }
    return result==0;
}
```

This code iterates through all characters and performs a bitwise XOR operation on each pair of characters, accumulating the result. This ensures the comparison takes roughly the same amount of time regardless of the position of the first mismatch, mitigating the timing attack vulnerability.
