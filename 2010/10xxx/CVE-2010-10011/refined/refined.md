```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Femitter FTP server does not properly validate user-supplied input when handling file requests. Specifically, it fails to sanitize directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../, \\\\, etc.).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially including sensitive data like configuration files (e.g., boot.ini) or other system files.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted FTP command, including directory traversal sequences, to the FTP server when requesting a file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable FTP server (port 21) and send commands. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability as the exploit utilizes an anonymous login."
