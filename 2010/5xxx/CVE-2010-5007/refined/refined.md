```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The provided content indicates multiple vulnerabilities within UTStats.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `pages/match_report.php?mid=`.
    - SQL Injection in `index.php?p=matchp&pid='`.
    - Full Path Disclosure in `pages/servers_info.php`.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - XSS: Allows execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
    - SQL Injection: Allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion, and could lead to privilege escalation.
    - Full Path Disclosure: Exposes sensitive information about the server's file system structure, which can aid in further attacks.
- Attack vectors:
    - XSS: By crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable `mid` parameter.
    - SQL Injection: By crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable `pid` parameter.
    - Full Path Disclosure: By directly accessing the vulnerable `servers_info.php` page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server hosting the vulnerable UTStats application and have a basic understanding of web application vulnerabilities.
