Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Websense Enterprise v6.3.3 handles the "Via:" header in HTTP requests when integrated with Microsoft ISA Server (2004 or 2006) in a transparent authentication setup. The Websense product fails to properly inspect or validate requests containing a valid "Via:" header, leading to a complete bypass of its filtering and monitoring capabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Header Handling:** The core weakness is the lack of proper processing or validation of the "Via:" header. Websense appears to assume that the presence of this header means the request is coming from a trusted source and therefore bypasses all policy enforcement.
- **Trust Assumption:** The system implicitly trusts the "Via:" header, indicating a flaw in the trust model. This could be due to an assumption that the "Via:" header is only used or sent by proxy servers which have been vetted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Policy Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows users to completely bypass all web filtering and monitoring policies imposed by Websense.
- **Unrestricted Web Access:** Users can access any website, regardless of filtering rules.
- **Undetected Covert Tunnels:** Attackers can create covert communication channels using modified proxy tools, as the Websense system won't detect or log this activity.
- **Bypassed Transparent Authentication:** On Linux platforms, the vulnerability also bypasses Websense's transparent authentication mechanism.
- **Lack of Monitoring/Logging:** User activity is not logged or monitored by Websense.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves adding a valid "Via:" header to HTTP requests.
- **Browser Plugins:** Browser plugins like "Modify Headers" can be used to inject the header for regular browsing.
- **Modified Proxy Tools:** Tools like OpenVPN, connect-proxy, PuTTY, stunnel, can be modified to inject the "Via:" header.
- **Downstream Proxy Servers:** Downstream SQUID proxies can be configured to send requests through the upstream ISA server with a "Via:" header, bypassing Websense.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Attackers need to understand how HTTP headers work.
- **Access to a Vulnerable Network:** Attackers must be within a network environment that utilizes the vulnerable version of Websense Enterprise integrated with ISA server and transparent authentication.
- **Ability to modify or inject HTTP headers:** Attackers must be able to inject the "Via:" header through browser plugins or modified applications.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit does not work over SSL, however, the attacker can bypass this by using a proxy server over SSL, effectively bypassing the SSL restriction.
- The author suspects this vulnerability is already known in some circles due to its simplicity.
- The vendor was notified on 10/09/2009 and the PoC was published on 05/29/2010
