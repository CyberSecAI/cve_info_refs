============================================================

Affected Product: Avast Internet Security 5.0
Vulnerability: Memory Corruption
Author: x90c
Date: September 25, 2010

Details:
-------

A memory corruption vulnerability has been discovered in the avast! Internet Security 5.0 software. This vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of data when scanning specially crafted RAR archives. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

When scanning these archives, the software fails to properly validate the data leading to a memory corruption. This vulnerability can be triggered when a user scans a malicious RAR archive, through real-time protection or manual scanning.

Impact:
-------

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Application crash (Denial of Service)
- Arbitrary code execution

Attack Vector:
-------------

The vulnerability can be triggered when a user scans a specially crafted RAR archive.

- Real-time protection scanning of a malicious RAR archive.
- Manual scanning of a malicious RAR archive.

Exploit:
--------
Proof of concept code is not included in this advisory, however, this vulnerability is easily exploitable.
