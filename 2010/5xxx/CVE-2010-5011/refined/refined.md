Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-5011:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Software:** SchoolMation Version 2.3
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   SQL Injection (SQLi)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to both SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The `session` parameter in the `studentmain.php` script is vulnerable to both.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Crafted SQL queries injected into the `session` parameter within the `studentmain.php` URL.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Malicious JavaScript code injected into the `session` parameter of the `studentmain.php` URL.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive data, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the context of other users' browsers, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can exploit this remotely by crafting a malicious URL with SQL injection or XSS payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerable parameter is `session` in the `studentmain.php` file.
    *   The provided text shows a placeholder "[sqli]" in the URL to indicate where SQL injection payloads can be placed, which could be in the form of crafted SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The same `session` parameter in the `studentmain.php` file is also vulnerable to XSS.
    *   The provided exploit demonstrates a payload for XSS attack as `'"--><script>alert(0x000872)</script>'`.
*   **Vulnerable URL:** The attack vector is based on the `studentmain.php` page with the session parameter:
    *   `http://server/schoolmv2/html/studentmain.php?session=[sqli]`
    *    `http://server/demo/schoolmv2/html/studentmain.php?session=[XSS]`

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Sid3^effects of Inj3ct0r Team.
*   The vulnerabilities were found on June 9, 2010.
*   The vulnerable application is a commercial product called SchoolMation Version 2.3.

**Summary:**

CVE-2010-5011 refers to SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the `session` parameter of the SchoolMation 2.3 application. An attacker can use these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the database and/or inject malicious scripts into the application, posing significant security risks.
