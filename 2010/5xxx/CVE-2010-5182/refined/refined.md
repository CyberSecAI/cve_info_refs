Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2010-5182:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how antivirus (AV) products use System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks within the Windows operating system to implement their security features.
*   The core issue is a race condition that occurs when an AV tries to validate code before execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Argument-Switch Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited using a technique called the "argument-switch" attack. This method involves sending benign code to the AV for initial inspection, which then passes the security checks. Right before execution, the benign code is swapped with malicious code.
*   **Race Condition:**  The attack relies on a race condition where one thread is unable to track the activities of other concurrently running threads on multicore processors. This allows the attacker to switch the code at the right moment, effectively bypassing the AV's real-time checks.
*   **SSDT Hooking:** AV software that relies on SSDT hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks to monitor system calls is susceptible.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of AV Protection:** The primary impact is the ability to bypass the real-time protection offered by antivirus software, allowing malicious code to execute undetected.
*  **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware on a system even if it is protected by AV software.
*   **AV Disablement:** The attack can potentially be used to disable or remove the AV software itself, further compromising the system's security.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** It is stated that even a user with limited privileges could potentially use this attack to disable the AV, which normally would require administrative rights

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Executable Payload:**  The attack requires the attacker to be able to execute a binary on the target machine.
*   **Code Injection:** This technique involves loading code onto the targeted machine.
*  **Exploit Chaining:** The technique can be combined with other exploits such as vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader or Java Virtual Machine to deliver the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Run Code:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system. This often means they have already gained some access, perhaps through another exploit.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to precisely time the swap between the benign and malicious code to exploit the race condition.
*   **Technical Knowledge:**  A good understanding of how AV software hooks into the OS kernel is required, along with the ability to execute the code injection correctly.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affected a broad range of popular AV products.
*   The attack does not affect malware that AV systems already have signatures for, it's mainly focused on new, unknown malware.
*   The attack requires a large amount of code to be loaded, making it unsuitable for certain types of attacks but viable when chained with other exploits.
*   The exploit works even under non-admin accounts.
