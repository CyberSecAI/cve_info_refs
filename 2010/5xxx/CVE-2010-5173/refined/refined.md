Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a race condition within the way anti-virus (AV) software uses system service descriptor table (SSDT) hooks or other kernel-mode hooks to monitor system calls. The vulnerability stems from the anti-virus's inability to consistently track simultaneously running threads on multi-core processors and the ability to swap a benign code with malicious code before execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition that occurs when multiple threads are running simultaneously on multi-core processors. The timing of the switch is crucial and the AV software's inability to reliably track all threads leads to the vulnerability.
*   **SSDT Hooks:** The vulnerability exploits the way AV programs use SSDT hooks to modify parts of the OS kernel. This approach, while intended for security, introduces a point of manipulation through the race condition.
*   **Argument Switching:** The technique involves an "argument-switch" attack, where a benign sample of code passes AV checks, but is then swapped with a malicious payload just before execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing AV Protection:** The most significant impact is the ability to bypass the core protection mechanisms of AV software. This allows malicious code to execute undetected on the system.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware without raising suspicion from the AV software.
*   **AV Disablement:** A user without admin rights could potentially disable the running AV software, which should normally require admin privileges.
*   **Complete Compromise:** Once the AV is bypassed or disabled, the attacker can achieve full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Execution of a Binary:** The attacker needs to be able to run a binary on the targeted PC.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The attack requires the attacker to inject a malicious payload that replaces the initial benign code.
*   **Timing and Multicore Systems:** The attack is facilitated by multi-core processors, and the timing of the switch is critical for successful exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to execute code on the target system:** An attacker needs to have some initial access or an exploit to execute code on the target machine. This initial code could be a dropper or part of a more complex exploit chain.
*   **Knowledge of AV hook implementation:** The attacker needs to understand the mechanics of how AV software uses SSDT hooks to detect malicious code.
*   **Timing precision:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the attack such that the benign code is swapped with the malicious code at the exact moment when the AV software has already passed the benign code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attack technique is referred to as an "argument-switch" attack.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at matousec.com
*   The technique reportedly affects a wide range of AV products that use SSDT hooks
*   The attack is said to be effective even when the targeted machine is running under an account with limited privileges.
*  The method is not suitable for shellcode based attacks due to the large amount of code required.
*  The technique could be combined with other exploits such as an Adobe Reader or Java VM exploit to install malware.
*   The vulnerability can be used to disable the AV software even if the user doesn't have administrative rights.

This vulnerability highlights a weakness in the way many AV solutions monitor system calls and provides a method to bypass these protections, especially on multi-core processors.
