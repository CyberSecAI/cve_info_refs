Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-5104:

**CVE-2010-5104**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization in the `escapeStrForLike()` method of the TYPO3 Database API when the MySQL database connection is set to `sql_mode NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The lack of proper quoting of user input allows wildcards to be injected into LIKE queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Information Disclosure. By injecting wildcards into a LIKE query, an attacker could potentially disclose records that are intended to be kept private.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating user input that is then used in a LIKE query within the TYPO3 application when a specific database mode is enabled.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have control over input that is used in a LIKE query and the database connection needs to have the `sql_mode NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES` set.
