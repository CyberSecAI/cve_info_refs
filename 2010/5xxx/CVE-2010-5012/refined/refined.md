The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in dalogin 2.2, and mentions CVE-2010-5012.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

1.  **Config file disclosure:** The configuration file `config.ini` is accessible via the web at `[path]/admin/include/config.ini`.
2.  **SQL injection:** The `id` parameter from the HTTP request is used directly in an SQL query without any filtering or sanitization in `news_comments.php` at line 115.
3.  **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The `comment_text` and `comment_user` parameters from POST requests are used directly in a SQL insert query without any sanitization, in function `InsertComment()` at line 184, allowing injection of XSS payloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information disclosure:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials (user, pass, host), are exposed due to the accessible config file.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Unfiltered user input in a SQL query allows for injection of arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unfiltered user input is stored in the database and displayed, allowing injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Config file disclosure:** Allows an attacker to gain access to database credentials.
*   **SQL injection:**  Allows an attacker to read, modify, or delete database content, potentially including user data and application settings.
*  **XSS:** Enables an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, possibly leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Config file disclosure:** Direct access to the `config.ini` file through a web browser.
*   **SQL injection:**  Manipulating the `id` parameter in the HTTP request.
*  **XSS:** Posting a comment with malicious JavaScript code via HTTP POST request

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Config file disclosure:** The attacker only needs to know the location of the config file.
*   **SQL injection:** The attacker must be able to send an HTTP request with a manipulated `id` parameter to the vulnerable page.
*  **XSS:** The attacker must be able to send a POST request containing malicious code in comment parameters to the vulnerable page.
