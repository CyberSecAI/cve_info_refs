The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in VWar 1.6.1 R2, but it does not include an official CVE description. Therefore, based on the information within the provided content, I will extract the vulnerabilities listed within the document.

**1. SQL Injection**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in `vwar/article.php`. Specifically, the `ratearticleselect` and `rate` parameters are not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** SQL injection vulnerability in the article rating system.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can deface articles, cause denial of service (DoS), and potentially gain access to the database.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `vwar/article.php` with malicious values for `ratearticleselect` and `rate` parameters.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the web server.

**2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user input in multiple locations, specifically within the input fields of `challenge.php`, `joinus.php`, `admin/admin.php`, and `profile.php`. The application filters `<script>` tags, but allows `<img>` tags, which can be used to execute JavaScript.
*   **Weaknesses:** Stored XSS vulnerability in multiple input fields.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can potentially hijack user sessions, including administrative sessions, by injecting malicious scripts that are executed when other users view the content.
*   **Attack vector:** Injecting malicious HTML, such as `<IMG src='' onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`, into vulnerable input fields.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to input data into the specified forms.

**3. Broken Access Controls**

*   **Root cause:**  Missing access controls in `popup.php`. The application fails to restrict access to member-only news posts through the print view functionality.
*   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate access control for displaying member-only content.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized users can view content meant only for logged-in members.
*   **Attack vector:** Accessing the `popup.php` with the `printnews` action and a specific `newsid` in the URL.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Knowledge of the structure of URLs to access protected content.

**4. Weak Password Generation**

*   **Root cause:** The `createRandomPassword` function uses the current second of the system time as the seed for `mt_srand()`, creating a limited set of possible passwords. There is also no account lockout mechanism in place.
*  **Weaknesses:** Weak random password generation and lack of account lockout,
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can easily brute force user passwords.
*  **Attack vector:** Using an automated tool in combination with the user enumeration vulnerability in `<http://mydomain.com/vwar/admin/index.php?login=1>` to gain access to any account.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the login form.

**5. Static Session Cookies**

*   **Root cause:** Session cookies are generated by hashing the user's password, resulting in static session identifiers that don't change.
*   **Weaknesses:** Static session cookie generation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who obtains a user's session cookie can maintain access indefinitely, even after logouts and session timeouts.
*   **Attack vector:** Obtaining a user's session cookie through methods such as XSS.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to obtain a user's cookie, for instance by exploiting the stored XSS vulnerability.
