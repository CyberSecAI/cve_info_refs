- Root cause of vulnerability:
    -  e107 fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering submitted news item titles for administrative review, leading to XSS.
    -  e107 fails to use a difficult-to-discover random token in the user add form, leading to XSRF. The token is derived from the MD5 hash of the admin account's creation date which is easily discoverable by regular users.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the news submission review process.
    - Cross-site request forgery (XSRF) vulnerability in the user add form.

- Impact of exploitation:
    - Unauthenticated users can exploit XSS to attack other users.
    - Exploitation of XSS can potentially lead to compromise of the e107 service or host.
    - Unauthenticated users can exploit the XSRF vulnerability to create new users.
    
- Attack vectors:
    - XSS: Malicious users can submit news with crafted titles containing JavaScript via the default submitnews.php URL. This script would execute when an administrator views the approval queue at e107_admin/newspost.php?sn.
    - XSRF: An attacker can derive the admin account creation timestamp by viewing a user profile. They can then use this information to generate a valid token and submit a user creation request through e107_admin/users.php?create.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to submit news items.
    - For XSRF, the attacker needs to be able to view the "Joined" date of the admin user.
