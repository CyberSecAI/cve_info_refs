Get started with Bitcoin

Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. **Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and [everyone can take part](/en/support-bitcoin)**. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

## CVE-2010-5140

Summary: Never confirming transactions
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| Affected | | Fix |

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

Its a bug in the transaction checks which did not reject it, then someone noticed and exploited it. Presumably a new version will be able to reject it and start a new valid fork. meanwhile should probablt shut down whatever you can and by no means make nor accept any transactions. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

The code check each transaction output for negative numbers individually (up to ver 0.3.8 at least) but forgot to check that the sum of two outputs (where you have the normal output of a transaction and the "change" leftover amount returned to the sender) is negative. So if you put two large but positive values in the transaction the overflow is then only checked that it is less than or equal to the inputs.Normally the inputs are equal to the outputs of a transaction. The exception is when there is a "fee" charged for the transaction. The net allows anyone to voluntarily pay any amout for a fee. SO when the sum was negative the difference from the input looked like a fee. It slipped thru all the checks. Her is some of the details: out Value 1:92233720368.54(7ffffffffff85ee0) out Value 2:92233720368.54(7ffffffffff85ee0)the sum would make -0.01 BTCgenerated transaction "reward" including 51 bitcent "fee" out Value:50.51(000000012d1024c0)that implies the input value was 0.50 BTC | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

And then wait a month or so until you make a block which will include your transactions...

Try sending a ton of 0.01 transactions -- most of these transactions will work if this is the case.[Quote from: Tritonio on September 29, 2010, 12:27:57 PM](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.msg14515#msg14515)Or wait until someone else with a custom client includes your transactions in his block.For this you'll want to use the *-maxconnections* switch with a high number of connections, because propagation of your invalid transaction will be very poor.You could also "double-spend" your pre-experiment coins by acting as though the unconfirmed transactions never happened. A wallet backup would roll things back, for example. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   1NXYoJ5xU91Jp83XfVMHwwTUyZFK64BoAD | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

The more transactions waiting to be included in a block, the higher the transaction fee has to be for one to get in.theymos: well... the problem is that it causes problems for the wallets that happen to have received those transactions. my wallet now includes a bunch of small transactions that will never be confirmed (due to their not having paid the requisite fees). since the client does not let the user control which coins to send, any transaction i send out in the future is liable to try to include those coins in the outgoing payment, which, in turn, will never get confirmed, thus borking my whole wallet.so say a 'rogue' client harvests a bunch of addresses of the net (these forums are a good and ripe place), and starts sending out a bunch of .000001 payments with no fee. now these wallets will all be contaminated with these never-to-be-confirmed payments, and since the client doesn't allow one to choose which coins get sent, they may be included in future outgoing payments, which will also never get confirmed.so what should i do to 'clear' my wallet? i'd need some custom tool to be able to send /specific coins/, so that i can send them all to another wallet and drop the contaminated one.and more importantly, for the future - how do we address this problem? | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   Join #bitcoin-market on freenode for real-time market updates.Join #bitcoin-otc - an over-the-counter trading market. <http://bitcoin-otc.com>OTC web of trust: <http://bitcoin-otc.com/trust.php>My trust rating: <http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewratingdetail.php?nick=nanotube> | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

FFS just wait 10minutes for a block to appear confirming them.  Grin | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Smileyor maybe i'll just wait around for this to make it into the next official release... if satoshi agrees with jgarzik as far as including those options in mainline, maybe i don't have to wait that long... | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   Join #bitcoin-market on freenode for real-time market updates.Join #bitcoin-otc - an over-the-counter trading market. <http://bitcoin-otc.com>OTC web of trust: <http://bitcoin-otc.com/trust.php>My trust rating: <http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewratingdetail.php?nick=nanotube> | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

My 'stock client' balance shows as 131.00139787, and my modified client balance shows as 130.92112098, so i have about 0.08xx of "bad" bitcoins' worth of transactions in my wallet.So I guess now, all i need to do is create another wallet, and then send all the "good coins" from my old wallet to my new one (or, i guess... i could just use the same wallet, since my bitcoind won't try to send the bad coins, i can just ignore them....)But yes, I hope the modifications as described by jgarzik (being configurable with cli switches/checkboxes) do make it into mainline - because otherwise it's too easy to 'poison' people's wallets with bogus transactions. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   Join #bitcoin-market on freenode for real-time market updates.Join #bitcoin-otc - an over-the-counter trading market. <http://bitcoin-otc.com>OTC web of trust: <http://bitcoin-otc.com/trust.php>My trust rating: <http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewratingdetail.php?nick=nanotube> | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
