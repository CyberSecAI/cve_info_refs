{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper security context management when executing templates in Liferay Portal. Specifically, template engines like FreeMarker and Velocity were not initializing a new template context specific to each plugin. This resulted in templates being executed with the context of the portal instead of the plugin, leading to potential security issues.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper context initialization for template engines.",
      "Lack of classloading control within templates.",
      "Insufficient access control within templates, allowing access to classes/packages not intended for plugin access."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation could allow a malicious plugin to execute code with elevated privileges, potentially compromising the entire Liferay Portal instance. The ability to access classes and packages through the template engine could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious Liferay plugin containing crafted templates.",
       "Exploitation of template processing by an attacker who has control over template content."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to deploy a malicious plugin with crafted templates to the Liferay Portal instance or gain the ability to control the template content being processed."
  },
    "fixes": [
      "The commit introduces context initialization per plugin by classloader.",
       "Adds helper utilities to support classloading control and access control within templates."
    ]
