    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure DLL loading",

    "impact": "Attackers can execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate DLL in a location where the application searches for libraries (e.g., network shares, USB drives). When the application attempts to load the legitimate DLL, it instead loads the attacker-controlled DLL.",

    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to write a file to a location that will be searched when the vulnerable application attempts to load a DLL. This could be a network share, USB drive, or a similar location that can be accessed by the victim user."
