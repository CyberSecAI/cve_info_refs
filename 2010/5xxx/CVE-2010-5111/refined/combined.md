```
Package: echoping
Version: 6.0.2-3
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch
Justification: user security hole

I use Smokeping to monitor a number of external hosts. echoping is
called by EchoPingHttps Smokeping probe, and it crashes several times a
week, resulting in syslog error like:

Dec 11 00:13:27 bor kernel: [49668.766339] echoping[17510]: segfault at 767c858e ip 0804db39 sp bfea8710 error 4 in echoping[8048000+9000]

Hopefully, I found the source of this crash. I'm now running the patched
echoping binary to verify the fix, which is provided below. (Strictly
speaking, only the last change is required, but the former two improve
safety without causing any harm.)

Well, crashed again at the same place, ("if (TLS_buffer[i] == '\n')"

I've just committed your patch to echoping and it seems to work but I
wonder why it was reported as a security risk. I do not immediately
see why.

> I wonder why it was reported as a security risk.

My concern is the third gnutls_record_recv() call. 'maxlen' argument
of TLS_readline() was passed to the call as is, and TLS_readline()
callers *always pass the full size* of TLS_buffer[] as 'maxlen', but
pointer passed to the gnutls_record_recv() is (TLS_buffer + some
offset). So, in theory, remote side could send specifically prepared
data which could overwrite up to MAXTOREAD bytes past the buffer. As
I'm not a security expert, I can't say for sure if it is really
exploitable or not, but it does not look good at all.

...Bye..Dmitry.

I also confirm that the patch fixed the crashes for me.

I should note that the problem HTTPS server is rather unstable (15.25%
failed requests over 10 days). Most likely the crash never happens
with properly working servers.

I'm attaching new version of the patch. It fixes another missed crash
at "else if (TLS_buffer[buf_end] != '\n')" line, as well as the same
issues in duplicate code of SSL_readline().

P.S.
  I have concerns about "i <= buf_end" inside another condition
branch. Most likely, it needs to be '<' instead of '<=', but I'm not
quite familiar with the code, so this change is not included into the
patch.

Unfortunately, this was not enough. It is also necessary to fix code
which checks return values of SSL and TLS receive functions. Another
cumulative patch is attached. It should be applied to Debian version
instead of (rather than in addition to) all previously provided
patches.

Stephane, I'll send you upstream-based patch separately.

At the moment I auto-setup $http_proxy to make emerge -f work. The problem is that I can't update my portage-tree when I'm behind a firewall. This could be fixed by checking the existance of http_proxy and set wgetopts to proxy=on. Hope this will be integratet to futher webrsync's... ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Marius Mauch (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-12-03 08:37:57 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [28128](show_bug.cgi?id=28128 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - integrate emerge-webrsync functionality in emerge sync") *** ``` |  |

# Echoping: Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities — GLSA **201406-07**

A buffer overflow in Echoping might allow remote attackers to cause
a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/echoping** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.0.2\_p434** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.0.2\_p434** |

### Background

Echoping is a small program to test performances of a
remote host by sending it TCP packets.

### Description

A boundary error exists within the “TLS\_readline()” function, which
can be exploited to overflow a global buffer by sending an overly long
encrypted HTTP reply to Echoping. Also, a similar boundary error exists
within the “SSL\_readline()” function, which can be exploited in the
same manner.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP reply, possibly
resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Echoping users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=net-analyzer/echoping-6.0.2_p434"

```
### References

* [CVE-2010-5111](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2010-5111)

**Release date**
