Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described, which is relevant to CVE-2010-5179 (although the CVE itself does not have a description):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how many antivirus (AV) products implement security features by using System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks within the Windows operating system.
*   These hooks are designed to intercept system calls and check for malicious activity before allowing execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition vulnerability, specifically a TOCTOU issue, that allows an attacker to swap a benign piece of code with malicious code between the time the AV checks it and the time the OS executes it.
*   **Bypass of Kernel-Mode Hooks:** By exploiting the race condition on multi-core processors, the malicious code can bypass the AV's kernel-mode hooks, essentially tricking the AV into allowing execution of what was initially deemed safe.
*   **Vulnerability of Many AV Products:** The research indicates that a wide range of AV products using SSDT or similar kernel-level hooks were susceptible, suggesting a systemic issue in the way these products were designed.
*   **Limited Privileges Bypass:** The attack could be used even when the user account has limited privileges.
*   **AV Disabling:** The attack could also be used to disable the AV software by user without administrative rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malware Installation:** Successful exploitation would allow attackers to install malware on the targeted system without detection by the installed AV software.
*   **Complete Bypass of AV Protection:** Once the malicious code executes, the AV protection is essentially rendered ineffective.
*   **System Takeover:** The attacker would gain a foothold to further compromise the system.
*   **AV Disabling:** The attack could also be used to disable the AV software.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Code Injection:** The attack involves injecting a benign code sample that will be approved by the AV, and then swapping it with a malicious payload before execution.
*   **Multi-Core Processor Exploitation:** The attack leverages race conditions that occur when different threads are processed simultaneously on multi-core processors.
*   **Combination with other Exploits:**  This technique could be combined with other software vulnerabilities (e.g., in PDF viewers or Java) to deliver the initial benign code sample.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Run a Binary:** The attacker must already have the capability to execute a binary on the target system. This could be achieved through a separate exploit, social engineering, or other means.
*   **Knowledge of the AV Software:** The attacker needs an understanding of how to exploit the AV software through the argument-switch technique.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The attack is not practical for shellcode-based or stealth-focused attacks due to the amount of code needed.
*   The vulnerability is time-sensitive, requiring precise timing for the code swap.
*   Although the article is over a year old, it emphasizes the need for security in depth as F-secure highlights that this specific attack bypasses some, but not all of their security layers.
