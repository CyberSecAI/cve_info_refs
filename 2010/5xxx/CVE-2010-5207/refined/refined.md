- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CelFrame Office Suite applications load external libraries using insufficiently qualified paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL hijacking/loading/injection/preloading. The applications attempt to load specific DLLs (e.g., `java_msci.dll`, `msci_java.dll`, `wintab32.dll`) from a location within the program's execution path or from a location accessible to the user when opening a related document file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name as one of the vulnerable DLLs in a location where the application will load it from. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Placing a malicious DLL (with names like `java_msci.dll`, `msci_java.dll`, `wintab32.dll`) in a shared folder, USB drive, file-sharing network, or social network, along with a seemingly harmless document file (e.g., `.doc`, `.xls`, `.sla`, `.odg`, `.plx`).
    - When a user opens a document with an affected extension in CelFrame Office Suite, the application will load the malicious DLL if it is present in the application's path or directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the targeted user will access it and a related document file using the vulnerable application, and be able to persuade a victim to open the file in a vulnerable application..
