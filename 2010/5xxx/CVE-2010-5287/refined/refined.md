```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of `default.asp`.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database, modifying data, or compromising the server.
- Attack vectors: HTTP GET request to `default.asp` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
