Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2010-5013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the `listing_detail.asp` page of the Virtual Real Estate Manager 3.5 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `Lid` parameter when constructing the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The vulnerable page is `listing_detail.asp?Lid=[SQLi]`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, enabling them to read, modify, or delete sensitive information.
- **Integrity Compromise:** An attacker might be able to manipulate or corrupt the data within the database, leading to application malfunction or misrepresentation of the data.
- **Partial Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a partial impact on all three parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The SQL injection vulnerability is accessible remotely through the web application.
- **HTTP Request:** Attackers send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `listing_detail.asp` page, injecting SQL code into the `Lid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication to the web application.
