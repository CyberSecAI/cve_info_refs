# Security Releases

When potential security holes are discovered in SilverStripe's [supported modules](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/project_governance/supported_modules/), we produce security releases to ensure that you are able to promptly secure your SilverStripe websites (check our [security release process](http://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/)). All releases are available on our [download](stable-download/) page, and are [announced](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases) on our forums (register to subscribe). Vulnerabilities in releases are disclosed here. Please subscribe to our security release [RSS feed](software/download/security-releases/rss) and [pre-announcement mailing list](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/contributing/release_process/#pre-announce-mailinglist) to stay updated.

   See <https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/debugging/environment_types/> for more information.

  If a website has been set to the "dev" environment mode, a URL can be provided which includes an XSS payload which will be executed in the resulting error message.

* ### CVE-2024-53277 XSS in form messages

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2024-53277
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.3.8
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.3.8
  Release Date:2025-01-15

  In some cases, form messages can contain HTML markup. This is an intentional feature, allowing links and other relevant HTML markup for the given message.

  Some form messages include content that the user can provide. There are scenarios in the CMS where that content doesn't get correctly sanitised prior to being included in the form message, resulting in an XSS vulnerability.

  **Base CVSS:** [5.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### SS-2024-001 TinyMCE allows svg files linked in object tags

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2024-001
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.2.16
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.2.16
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  TinyMCE v6 has a configuration value convert\_unsafe\_embeds set to false which allows svg files containing javascript to saved which can be used as a vector for XSS attacks

  After patching the default value of convert\_unsafe\_embeds will be set to true. This means that object tags will be converted to iframes instead the next time the page is saved, which may break any pages that rely upon previously saved object tags. Users are to override this config if desired so that object tags are again used instead of iframes. Note that embed tags are not allowed by default.
  We reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.

  This vulnerability was described by TinyMCE as follows:

  *A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content loading and content inserting code. A SVG image could be loaded though an `object` or `embed` element and that image could potentially contain a XSS payload.*

  Release Date:2024-07-17

  The `Report` class has a `canView` method. If that method is configured to return `false`, the current user should not be able to view the report. While the report list will omit any `canView` `false` reports, those reports can still access them directly assuming the user has the `CMS\_ACCESS\_ReportAdmin` permission.

  After patching the `canView` check will be properly respected

* ### CVE-2023-49783 - No permission checks for editing or deleting records with CSV import form

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-49783
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1, ^2
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: 1.13.19, 2.1.8
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  Users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions.

  The likelyhood of a user having create permissions but *not* having edit or delete permissions is low, but it *is* possible.

  Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the [`showImportForm` public property](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Admin/ModelAdmin.html#property_showImportForm), nor does it impact the `SecurityAdmin` section.

  #### Action may be required

  If you have a custom implementation of [`BulkLoader`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html), you should update your implementation to respect permissions when the return value of [`getCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_getCheckPermissions) is true.

  If you are using any `BulkLoader` in your own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, you should consider passing `true` to [`setCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_setCheckPermissions) if the data is provided by users.

* ### CVE-2023-44401 - View permissions are bypassed for paginated lists of ORM data in GraphQL queries

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-44401
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/graphql: 4.3.7, 5.1.3
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page.

  Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn’t paginated per se.

  This has been fixed by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in your query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results.

  This behaviour is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly.

  You can choose to disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin following the instructions in [overriding default plugins](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/graphql/plugins/overview/#overriding-default-plugins).

  Note that this vulnerability does not affect silverstripe/graphql version 3.x.

* ### CVE-2023-40180 - DDOS Vulnerability on GraphQL due to lack of protection against recursive queries

  Severity:
  High ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-40180
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^3.0.0, ^4.0.0, ^5.0.0
  Versions Fixed:3.8.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.4, 5.0.3
  Release Date:2023-10-16

  An attacker could use a recursive graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed graphql schemas.

  If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this may further mitigate the risk.

  The fix includes some new configuration options which you might want to tweak for your project, based on your own requirements. See the documentation in the references for details.

* ### SS-2023-002 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities inherited form TinyMCE

  Severity:

  Identifier:SS-2023-002
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: ^1.13.6
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  TinyMCE 4.x is vulnerable to several XSS vectors, which had been patched in later versions. Two of these have been identified as affecting `silverstripe/admin`.

  Only Silverstripe CMS 4 is affected by these vulnerabilities. It's not possible to upgrade Silverstripe CMS 4 to use a more recent release of TinyMCE without introducing breaking changes. Instead, the security patches that shipped in later releases of TinyMCE have been backported to the TinyMCE version bundled in `silverstripe/admin`.

  Silverstripe CMS 5 is not affected by these vulnerabilities because it uses TinyMCE 6.

  These vulnerabilities were described by TinyMCE:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.

* ### CVE-2023-32302 Members with no password can be created and bypass custom login forms

  Severity:
  None ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-32302
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^3, ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 4.13.14, 5.0.13
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  When a new Member record was created in the cms it was possible to set a blank password. If an attacker knows the email address of the user with the blank password then they can attempt to log in using an empty password. The default member authenticator, login form and basic auth all require a non-empty password, however if a custom authentication method is used it may allow a successful login with the empty password.

  After being patched, blank passwords are no no longer allowed when members are created in the CMS. Programatically created Member records, such as those used in unit tests, still allow blank passwords.

  You may have some Member records in your system already which have empty passwords. To detect these, you can loop over all Member records with `Member::get()` and pass each record into the below method. It might be sensible to create a `BuildTask` for this purpose.

  ```
  use SilverStripe\Security\Member;
  use SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\MemberAuthenticator;

  private function memberHasBlankPassword(Member $member): bool
  {
      // skip default admin as this is created programatically
      if ($member->isDefaultAdmin()) {
          return false;
      }
      // return true if a blank password is valid for this member
      $authenticator = new MemberAuthenticator();
      return $authenticator->checkPassword($member, '')->isValid();
  }
  ```

  Once you have identified the records with empty passwords, it's up to you how to handle this. The most sensible way to resolve this is probably to generate a new secure password for each of these members, mark it as immediately expired, and email each affected member (assuming they have a valid email address in the system).

  **Base CVSS**: [0.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:X/RC:C&version=3.1)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

necessary unfortunately. They're noted in the changelog already, but
to make this clear:

[98375] HTTP::setGetVar() always returns absolute URLs. Use
Director::makeRelative() to make them relative again. (merged from
r98373)
[98375] HTTP::setGetVar() combines any GET parameters in PHP array
notation (e.g. "foo[bar]=val") instead of replacing the whole array
(merged from r98373)

If you've used HTTP::setGetVar(), please check your sites before
upgrading.

Ok went through the list a bit, the latest one already exists,

(already assigned) CVE-2012-0976 	Cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability in admin/EditForm in SilverStripe 2.4.6 allows remote

these details are obtained from third party information.

Subject: CVE-request: SilverStripe before 2.4.4

Can I get 2011 CVE-identifiers for SilverStripe issues fixed in 2.4.4:

<http://www.silverstripe.org/security-releases/>

SQL information disclosure, SQL injection in Translatable extension, Cross
Site Request Forgery in various CMS interfaces, XSS in controller action
handling

Requested originally in <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q1/12> but never got assigned. I can collect information about other versions too and request missing CVE-identifiers, but that will take some time.
