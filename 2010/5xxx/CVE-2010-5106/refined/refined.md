Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the XML-RPC remote publishing interface of WordPress.
*   The core issue is insufficient permission checks within the XMLRPC code, specifically in how it handles user capabilities when performing actions like editing, publishing, and deleting posts and comments via the XML-RPC interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The XML-RPC interface doesn't properly enforce access control restrictions.
*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:**  The code fails to properly verify user roles and capabilities before allowing actions.
*   **Incorrect Capability Checks:** The code was using `edit_post` capability where `publish_posts` or `delete_post` was needed in certain contexts
*   **Missing checks** In some cases the code was missing a check for a valid comment id before continuing

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers with Author or Contributor level accounts could improperly edit, publish, or delete posts, pages and comments.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Could lead to unauthorized changes to website content by lower-level users

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the XML-RPC interface.
*   **XML-RPC Interface:** The attack vector is through the `xmlrpc.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker must have a WordPress user account with at least Author or Contributor level privileges.
*   **Access to XML-RPC Interface:**  The attacker needs access to the website's XML-RPC interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved changes to the `xmlrpc.php` file to implement proper capability checks using functions like `current_user_can`
*   The vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 3.0.3.
