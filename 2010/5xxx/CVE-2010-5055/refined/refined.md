Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-5055

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `index.php?a=pages` URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords. In the given example, it is used to extract the credentials stored in the `almnzm_customers` table by using a `UNION ALL SELECT` query.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can lead to more severe attacks, potentially allowing an attacker to modify or delete data or gain administrative privileges on the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file. The malicious SQL code is injected into the `id` parameter.
- **Specific URL:** The specific URL path to target is `index.php?a=pages&id=`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious SQL injection queries.
- **No authentication:** The attacker does not need prior authentication or a specific user role to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit was published on 2010-04-14.
- The vulnerable software is `almnzm 2.1` or earlier.
- The application is written in PHP.
