  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2010-5107",
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way default server configuration of OpenSSH, a open source implementation of SSH protocol versions 1 and 2, performed management of its connection slot. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause connection slot exhaustion on the server.",
    "root_cause": "The default OpenSSH configuration allowed remote attackers to easily exhaust connection slots due to a long default LoginGraceTime and a lack of random early drop for MaxStartups.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Default server configuration with long LoginGraceTime and lack of random early drop.",
       "Insufficient connection management leading to slot exhaustion."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by exhausting connection slots, preventing legitimate users from logging in.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote network connection.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to open multiple TCP connections to the SSH server."
