Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how anti-virus (AV) software uses System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or other kernel-mode hooks within the Windows operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Argument-Switch Attack:** The core weakness lies in the AV software's inability to maintain consistent tracking of multiple threads running concurrently on multi-core processors.
*   **SSDT Hooks:** The reliance on SSDT or similar kernel-level hooks for implementing security features makes the AV software vulnerable to this attack.
*   **Race Condition:**  A race condition occurs when a benign code sample passes AV checks, and then, just before execution, it is swapped with a malicious payload. The timing of the switch is crucial.
*   **Bypassed Security Checks:** The vulnerability allows malicious code, which would normally be blocked, to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **AV Bypass:** The attack bypasses the protection offered by various anti-virus products.
*   **Malware Installation:** It allows malware to be installed on the system without triggering the AV's security checks.
*   **AV Removal:**  The attack can potentially be used to remove or disable the AV software itself.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attack could be used by an user with limited privilege to disable the anti-virus, which should not be possible without admin rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Execution of a Binary:** The attacker needs to be able to run a binary on the target machine to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system. This could be achieved by combining the exploit with another vulnerability, like a vulnerability in Adobe Reader or Java, or by tricking user into executing a malicious file.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to precisely time the switch between the benign and malicious code samples to successfully execute the exploit on systems with multi core processors.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The attack is described as impractical for shellcode-based attacks or attacks requiring speed and stealth, due to the large code size required for the switch to occur.
*   The vulnerability is said to affect a large number of AV products that use SSDT or kernel-mode hooks for security functionality, potentially including 100% of tested products according to the researchers.
*   The technique is said to work even when Windows is running under an account with limited privileges.
