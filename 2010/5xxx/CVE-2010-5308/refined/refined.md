Based on the provided article from Forbes, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the use of weak default credentials on GE Healthcare's nuclear imaging machines, including X-Ray and CT scanners.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Weak Default Passwords:** The devices were shipped with easily guessable default passwords that did not adhere to security best practices (e.g., short passwords with no symbols, common words). Examples include "insite/2getin" for a breast scanner and "root/install" for a CT machine.
*   **Poor Password Management Guidance:** In some cases, documentation instructed users not to change the default passwords to ensure GE's ability to provide support. Additionally, guidance on how to change passwords was not readily available.
*   **Network Exposure:** Hospital networks and internal systems, including the medical devices, were found to be accessible over the internet, often with weak or no protection. This allowed external access to the vulnerable devices.
*   **Systemic Issue:** The problem was described as systemic across various medical technology manufacturers and not just limited to GE Healthcare.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Patient data stored on the affected machines, including personal and medical information, could be stolen, including private data from beneath the skin.
*   **Radiation Overdose:** Attackers could potentially alter the configuration of the machines and increase the radiation dosage, posing a physical threat to patients. High doses of radiation can damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer.
*   **Disruption of Services:** By gaining control of these devices, an attacker could disrupt hospital operations and patient care.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers would need to gain access to the hospital network to control the devices.
*   **Internet Access:** Devices were often accessible via the internet, making them vulnerable to remote attacks.
*   **Shodan Search Engine:** Publicly available search engines like Shodan can be used to identify exposed and vulnerable medical systems, making them easier to target.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** Ability to access the hospital's internal network either through internal compromise or external access if the hospital network is exposed.
*   **Technical Skills:** Knowledge of how to use tools like Shodan to discover vulnerable systems and the ability to manipulate the medical devices.
*   **Motivation:** An attacker could have a variety of motivations, including financial gain (data theft) or malicious intent (physical harm).
