{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Kolibri v2.0 due to insufficient bounds checking when handling a malformed HEAD request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflow",
     "Uncontrolled memory overwrite"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system. Attackers can gain control of the program's execution flow by overwriting the return address or SEH handler.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted 'HEAD' request to the Kolibri server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server, which means they need network access to the system running Kolibri. No authentication is required."
