| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-03 04:22:06 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Since videobuf allocates memory on mmap(), calling mmap enough times for the same buffer (offset) resulted in a new memory allocation by videobuf on each such call and losing the old allocation, resulting in a leak each time and the system running out of memory.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-04 01:53:01 UTC  ``` /dev/video has perms of 660, and only users in video group can trigger the issue. The machine needs to have a USB stick or webcam. However, on certain configuration, like a video surveillance server, it is quite like possible that users are given access to this group. Very low risk, non-default configuration.  mrg-1.2 not affected (no VIDEOBUF_VMALLOC in drivers/media/video/em28xx/Kconfig; old implementation). rhel-6 and fedora are affected. mrg-1.3 is affected (grep -ir 28xx MRG/config-*).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-04 01:54:57 UTC  ``` This was publicly discussed and logged here: <http://linuxtv.org/irc/v4l/index.php?date=2010-07-29>.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-04 03:44:31 UTC  ``` > The default permissions on RHEL5 are 0600: >  > $ ls -la /dev/video0 > crw------- 1 root root 81, 0 Ago  3 19:29 /dev/video0  So on rhel-5, this isn't a security issue to begin with.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c7)  Petr Matousek    2015-05-07 12:51:51 UTC  ``` CVE assignment:    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/08/4>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c8)  Petr Matousek    2015-05-18 13:59:56 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This issue does affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  Based on the absence of upstream patch addressing this issue in VIDEOBUF (newer drivers using VIDEOBUF2 are not affected) implementation and that Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact, this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future kernel updates for the respective releases. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=120571#c0)  Petter Reinholdtsen    2016-06-17 23:07:32 UTC  ``` Hi.  In 2010 a memory leak issue in the v4l mmap() code was reported in <URL: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=620629> >.  This is the description:    "Since videobuf allocates memory on mmap(), calling mmap enough times for the same buffer (offset) resulted in a new memory allocation by videobuf on each such call and losing the old allocation, resulting in a leak each time and the system running out of memory."  As far as I can tell, the issue is still present in the drivers using the videobuf code.  I've reported the issue to Debian as <URL: <https://bugs.debian.org/827340> > and the security issue is tracked on <URL: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5321> >.  Reporting it here to make sure the kernel developers are aware of the issue.  I've tried to reproduce the issue myself without success, but believe I have not been able to test with the right hardware.  I'm not sure which kernel version the issue was introduced, but set 3.2.78 as it is the oldest one reported in the Debian security tracker. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-03 04:22:06 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Since videobuf allocates memory on mmap(), calling mmap enough times for the same buffer (offset) resulted in a new memory allocation by videobuf on each such call and losing the old allocation, resulting in a leak each time and the system running out of memory.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-04 01:53:01 UTC  ``` /dev/video has perms of 660, and only users in video group can trigger the issue. The machine needs to have a USB stick or webcam. However, on certain configuration, like a video surveillance server, it is quite like possible that users are given access to this group. Very low risk, non-default configuration.  mrg-1.2 not affected (no VIDEOBUF_VMALLOC in drivers/media/video/em28xx/Kconfig; old implementation). rhel-6 and fedora are affected. mrg-1.3 is affected (grep -ir 28xx MRG/config-*).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-04 01:54:57 UTC  ``` This was publicly discussed and logged here: <http://linuxtv.org/irc/v4l/index.php?date=2010-07-29>.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2010-08-04 03:44:31 UTC  ``` > The default permissions on RHEL5 are 0600: >  > $ ls -la /dev/video0 > crw------- 1 root root 81, 0 Ago  3 19:29 /dev/video0  So on rhel-5, this isn't a security issue to begin with.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c7)  Petr Matousek    2015-05-07 12:51:51 UTC  ``` CVE assignment:    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/08/4>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=620629#c8)  Petr Matousek    2015-05-18 13:59:56 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This issue does affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  Based on the absence of upstream patch addressing this issue in VIDEOBUF (newer drivers using VIDEOBUF2 are not affected) implementation and that Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact, this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future kernel updates for the respective releases.

# CVE-2010-5321

| **Name** | CVE-2010-5321 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Memory leak in drivers/media/video/videobuf-core.c in the videobuf subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x through 4.x allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by leveraging /dev/video access for a series of mmap calls that require new allocations, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-6761. NOTE: as of 2016-06-18, this affects only 11 drivers that have not been updated to use videobuf2 instead of videobuf. |

Subject: linux: CVE-2010-5321 memory leak in videobuf on multiple calls to mmap()
Date: Wed, 15 Jun 2016 08:46:05 +0200
```

Package: src:linux
Version: 3.2.78-1
Severity: minor
Tags: security

In 2010 an issue with the linux kernel implementation of v4l was
discovered and reported to RedHat as
<URL: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=620629> >.  It was
assigned a CVE last year in
<URL: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/08/4> > and is
still unsolved as far as I can tell.

If I understand the issue correctly, a user with access to /dev/video
can cause the kernel to leak memory and eventually run out of memory by
doing repeated calls to mmap().  In other words, users with video group
membership can bring down the machine.

According to
<URL: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5321> > the
issue is present in Wheezy and onwards.  It is probably present in
earlier versions too.  I picked the kernel version number used in wheezy
for this report.

I noticed this issue, as it is the oldest non-fixed CVE number reported
by debsecan on my laptop, and decided it was time to track its progress
in a bug report.

I've tried to track down a way to reproduce the problem without any
luck so far.  I asked on #v4l to see if anyone there could help and got
some more information:

<pere> hi.  I'm trying to figure out if [CVE-2010-5321](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5321) reported via
   <URL: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=620629> > still
   exist in the linux kernel, and it links to
   <URL: <https://linuxtv.org/irc/v4l/index.php?date=2010-07-29> > for
   more information.  But that IRC log page is empty.  Anyone here know
   how to reproduce the problem or find the log from that day?
<pinchartl> pere: that's old
<pinchartl> the bug seems to affect videobuf only, not videobuf2
<pere> yeah.  at it seem to be unsolved, but I have not been able to verify it.
<pinchartl> not all drivers have been converted to videobuf2
<pinchartl> but if the drivers you are interested in have been, then you
   should be safe from that point of view
<pere> my focus is tracking CVEs in Debian, to know if the issue still
   exist or not.
<pere> <URL: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5321> >
   show the kernel still vulnerable...
<pinchartl> I don't know I'm afraid
<pinchartl> (one more reason to get rid of videobuf)
<pere> how can I tell if a driver/device uses videobuf and not videobuf2?
   I assume some specific hardware is needed to reproduce the problem.
<pinchartl> search for #include <media/videobuf-.*.h> in the sources
<pinchartl> there's 9 of them left if I count properly
<pinchartl> via-camera, fsl-viu, bttv, cx18, tm6000, zr364xx, cx231xx,
   pxa_camera and omap_vout
<pinchartl> ah, and omap1_camera and timblogiw in staging
<pinchartl> so that's 11
<pere> hm, wonder if I have a PCI card supported by bttv...
<pinchartl> patches would be great :-)
<pere> I am sure it would, but lack the capacity too look into that. :)
<pere> pinchartl: is the description in that bug report enough for you to
   know how to reproduce it?  I've tried writing a test program, but only
   got a v4l2 device and got EBUSY when calling mmap() several times there.
<pere> but I suspect my test program is flawed, as I did not really quite
   understand the description.
<pere> the redhat bug report was very short, and I suspect the details are
   in one of the referred bug reports, which are not available to the public. :(

According to this report the issue still exist in the kernel for a small
number of camera drivers, so I mark it as found in the unstable kernel too.

I notice this bug is tagged upstream.  Is there a bug report upstream too?
I've been unable to find any.
