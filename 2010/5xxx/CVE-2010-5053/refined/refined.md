Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-5053:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `prodid` parameter of the `com_xobbix` component for Joomla.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
-  This could allow the attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable Joomla component.
- The specific vulnerable parameter is `prodid`.
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a specially crafted SQL injection payload in the `prodid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application.
-  No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical details:**

The provided exploit PoC demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability:
`http://localhost/index.php?option=com_xobbix&catid=31&task=prod_desc&prodid=-21+union+select+1,2,3,4,group_concat(username,0x3a,password),6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16+from+jos_users--`

This payload injects a SQL `UNION SELECT` statement that retrieves usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
