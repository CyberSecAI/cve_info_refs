```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the UploadServlet of the ZENworks server, which allows uploading a malicious file outside of the TEMP directory. By accessing this uploaded file remotely, it gets executed within the context of the zenserver.exe process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper path handling in the UploadServlet allows writing files outside the intended temporary directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the user running the ZENworks server (zenserver.exe).",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the UploadServlet to upload a malicious file (e.g., a WAR file containing a JSP payload) to a location outside of the temporary directory. Subsequently, the attacker can trigger the execution of the malicious code by accessing the uploaded file via HTTP.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote."
