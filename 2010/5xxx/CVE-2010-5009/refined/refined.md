Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-5009:

**Root Cause:** The root cause lies in insufficient input sanitization and validation within the UTStats application, specifically when handling user-supplied data in various parts of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs in the `pages/match_report.php?mid=` parameter. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web pages, potentially compromising user sessions.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks via the `index.php?p=matchp&pid='` parameter. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially enabling them to read sensitive database information.
*  **Full Path Disclosure:** The `pages/servers_info.php` file reveals the full server path which is sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of XSS can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of web pages.
    *   Information theft.
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection can lead to:
    *   Exposure of database credentials.
    *   Unauthorized data access.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Potential full system compromise.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of Full Path Disclosure can lead to:
    *    Information gathering for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Manipulating the `mid` parameter in the `pages/match_report.php` URL.
*   **SQL Injection:** Manipulating the `pid` parameter in the `index.php?p=matchp` URL.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Direct access to `pages/servers_info.php` page

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker needs to be able to get a victim to click a crafted URL or inject the malicious URL via another vulnerability.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker needs to be able to access and send crafted GET requests.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker needs to be able to access the `servers_info.php` page directly

**Additional Notes:**

*   The identified vulnerabilities affect "all recent versions" of the UTStats software.
*   The exploit was tested on Windows 7 x64.
*   The report suggests that there may be other undiscovered vulnerabilities.
*   Multiple sources confirm these vulnerabilities.
