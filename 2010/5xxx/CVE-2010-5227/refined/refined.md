  "CVE-2010-5227": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Opera 10.61 is vulnerable to DLL hijacking via the loading of a malicious dwmapi.dll file.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application attempts to load 'dwmapi.dll' without specifying the full path, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL with the same name in a directory that is searched before the system directory.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "DLL hijacking"
      ],
       "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application. The provided exploit uses 'calc.exe' as an example payload.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local file system manipulation"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to write a file named 'dwmapi.dll' to a location that is searched before the system directory when Opera loads the library. This can potentially include locations within the same directory as the executable or within user profile locations. If the user then opens a vulnerable file format (.htm, .mht, .mhtml, .xht, .xhtm, .xhtl), it triggers the vulnerable code."
