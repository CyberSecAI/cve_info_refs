Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability, dubbed "argument-switch" attack, exploits a race condition in how some antivirus products utilize kernel-mode hooks, specifically SSDT (System Service Descriptor Table) hooks, to monitor system calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The core weakness lies in the timing of thread execution on multi-core processors.  Antivirus software hooks system calls to inspect them for malicious activity. The exploit sends a benign sample of code which is approved by the AV. Just before this benign code is executed, the exploit replaces it with a malicious payload. The race condition is that the AV's monitoring thread doesn't always catch the change due to the timing differences and the multi-core architecture.
- **SSDT Hooking:** The exploit specifically targets AV software that uses SSDT hooks or similar kernel-level hooks to implement their security features.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass AV Protection:** Successful exploitation allows malicious code to execute without being detected or blocked by the affected antivirus software.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers can use this to install malware on the victim's machine, potentially leading to a variety of malicious actions like data theft, system compromise, etc.
- **AV Disablement:** The exploit can potentially be used to disable the antivirus software itself, even by users with limited privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Execution:** The attack requires the attacker to be able to run a binary on the targeted PC. This could be through various methods such as exploiting another vulnerability or social engineering.
- **Timing-Dependent:** The "argument-switch" technique needs precise timing to successfully swap the benign code for malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute code on the target system:**  The attacker needs to have a way to run their exploit on the victim's machine.
- **Knowledge of AV Kernel Hooking:**  The attacker must understand how AV software uses SSDT hooks.
- **Timing Control:**  The attacker needs to be able to manage thread execution and timing to reliably trigger the race condition.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit is not suitable for stealthy shellcode-based attacks as it requires loading a large amount of code.
- The technique is effective even on systems running under an account with limited privileges.
- It is a technique that may be combined with other exploits (like vulnerable software) to deliver malware without triggering suspicion.
- The content suggests that a large number of AV products were vulnerable at the time of discovery (2010).
