On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

Root cause of vulnerability: Inclusion of multiple OP\_CHECKSIG commands in a single transaction
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Lack of validation for the number of OP\_CHECKSIG commands.
Impact of exploitation: Denial-of-service attack due to excessive processing by nodes.
Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted transactions with many OP\_CHECKSIG commands.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to create and broadcast Bitcoin transactions.
