Based on the provided content, here's information related to CVE-2010-5165:

*   **Vulnerability:** The "argument-switch" attack, also known as KHOBE, bypasses protections in anti-virus products by exploiting driver hooks within the Windows OS.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a race condition in multi-core processors where one thread cannot keep track of other simultaneously running threads. A benign code sample is initially sent to the anti-virus for security checks. Just before execution, it's swapped with a malicious payload.
*   **Affected Products:** AV software that uses SSDT (System Service Descriptor Table) hooks or other kernel-mode hooks to modify parts of the OS kernel. The article claims that "100% of the tested products were found vulnerable".
*   **Impact:** By exploiting this vulnerability, malicious code can be executed on a system, even with AV software running. This can lead to malware installation or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:**

    1.  The attacker needs to be able to run a binary on the targeted PC.
    2.  A benign code sample is sent to the AV software, which passes the security checks.
    3.  Just before execution, the benign code is swapped with a malicious payload.
*   **Limitations:**

    *   Requires a large amount of code to be loaded, making it impractical for shellcode-based attacks.
    *   Requires the attacker to already have the ability to run a binary on the targeted machine.
*   **Attack Scenario:** The technique might be combined with an exploit of another piece of software, say, a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader or Oracle's Java Virtual Machine, to install malware without arousing the suspicion of the any AV software the victim was using.
*   **Affected Vendors:** McAfee, Trend Micro, AVG, and BitDefender were specifically named, but the article indicates many more are affected.
