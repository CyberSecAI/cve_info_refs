Now you can not only visualize UI elements with HTML but also subscribe and respond to events triggered inside those elements. A new backstage view control similar to that in Microsoft Office 2010 is completely based on this declarative UI. A control like the backstage view has only one window handle and does not consume any additional window handles at all. **HTML Everywhere**, which first appeared as a beta version in v.2.90, is now much faster, supports most HTML and CSS features and can even visualize the HTML generated by Microsoft Word. What's New  * Added a `CExtRichContentScrollWnd` class, which implements a simple and fast scrollable HTML viewer control. * Added a `CExtRichGenWnd` class, which implements an HTML generator control. It uses a tree data structure describing a logical structure of UI elements to generate an HTML document that displays the described UI. This control is similar to a web server and a web browser together in one box. * Added a `CExtRibbonBackstageViewWnd` class (see [screenshot](http://www.prof-uis.com/img/versions/291/backstage-view.png)), which implements a backstage view control based on `CExtRichGenWnd`. The control generates and displays an HTML based backstage view similar to that in Microsoft Office 2010 applications. * Added a `CExtRibbonBar::m_pBackstageViewWnd` property and a set of new `CExtRibbonBar::BackstageView_***()` methods to use the backstage view control with the ribbon bar. * **HTML Everywhere** now supports:   + `float:left` and `float:right`   + `display:inline-block`   + `align` parameter of the `IMG` tag   + `overflow:scroll`   + CSS pseudo classes   + HTML output generated from the Microsoft Word * Added a `CExtRibbonBar::m_bFileTabButtonDisplaysText` property to display text on the ribbon file button (you can still display an icon instead). * Added an automatic best-fit feature for rows and columns in the `CExtGridWnd` control. * Added a `__EGCS_EX_AUTO_BEST_FIT` extended grid cell style, `__EGBS_BSE_EX_AUTO_BEST_FIT_COLUMNS` and `__EGBS_BSE_EX_AUTO_BEST_FIT_ROWS` grid control styles, a set of new `CExtGridWnd::OnGridQueryAutoBest***()` and `CExtGridWnd::OnGridDoAutoBestFit***()` virtual methods. * The `CExtEditBase` class now supports advanced Prof-UIS tooltips. Added a `CExtEditBase::m_nAdvancedTipStyle` property. * The `CExtSliderWnd` class now supports advanced Prof-UIS tooltips. Added a `CExtSliderWnd::m_nAdvancedTipStyle` property and `CExtSliderWnd::SetTooltipText()` method. * Added `CExtHeaderCtrl::OnNotifyHdnTrack()` and `CExtListCtrl::OnNotifyHdnTrack()` virtual methods for processing `HDN_TRACK` notifications from the `CExtHeaderCtrl` control. * The `CExtEditSystemNumber` control now supports editing of the scientific number format. Added a `CExtEditSystemNumberCurrencyBase::m_bUseScientificNumberMode` property and `CExtEditSystemNumber::LongDoubleGetBase()`, `CExtEditSystemNumber::LongDoubleGetMantissa()`, `CExtEditSystemNumber::LongDoubleGetPower()` methods. * Added a `CExtListCtrl::m_bSelectAllOnCtrlA` flag property to select all list view items on the **Ctrl+A** key combination. * Added a `CExtShellDialogBrowseFor::m_bHelperEnableShellAutoCompleteInEditor` property. If the `m_bHelperEnableShellAutoCompleteInEditor` is `true` (by default), the edit control can be used for typing paths and it supports auto completion.  Bug Fixes  * Fixed hijacking issues relating to invocations of the `LoadLibrary()` Win32 API. Now the `LoadLibrary()` is invoked only from the Prof-UIS source code at early stage global object constructions. * Fixed incorrect measurement of wrapped text in grid cells performed by the `CExtGridCell::MeasureCell()` virtual method. * The **AltGr** key was supported incorrectly in the `CExtMenuControlBar` class when it was used with some European keyboard layouts. * The `UDM_SETBUDDY` message was processed incorrectly in the `CExtEditWnd` class. It attached a `CExtSpinWnd` control to a `CExtEditWnd` control using an incorrect spin control location. * Fixed some Visual Studio 2010 project building issues in the Prof-UIS Integration Wizard. * The **Make New Folder** button in the Prof-UIS **Browse for Folder** dialog did not create a new folder under the drive root folder  Previous: [Version 2.90](/prof-uis/version-history/version-290.aspx) Next: [Version 2.92](/prof-uis/version-history/version-292.aspx) |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
