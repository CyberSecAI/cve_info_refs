It will seem like you've closed all your ports to the attacker, so he'll probably give up the hacking after a while.Code:sudo iptables -I INPUT -j DROP -s <attacker-ip>on the console should do the trick.Edit: sudo versionEdit 2: This firewall command doesn't survive a reboot, so after a reboot your server will allow traffic from the attacker again. I don't know how to save the firewall state on Ubuntu so it will be loaded during the boot process (I can tell you exactly how it works on Red Hat and Fedora though: sudo service iptables save).

Our servers have been used for constant DoS-attacks and generated huge traffic.I have setup some rules to ignore those flood requests but while our servers can't be used for DDoS attacks, we still receive millions of spoofed requests.. To get delisted, our servers will be inaccessible for a day or two.Here is a long thread at the Q3 ExcessivePlus site: <http://www.excessiveplus.net/forums/thread/servers-warp>There were some solutions given (sorry, I did not read the entire thread but here is one from Easy (an E+ Dev).Read the 2nd post: <http://www.excessiveplus.net/forums/thread/servers-warp?page=3>  . | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  | Logged |  ---   Calm is for LOSERS!  ANGER fuels my game and btw you're NEXT! | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

If the server is getting flooded the incoming packets will have a spoofed source address and you need WaspKiller's solution, but if your server gets hacked and it starts sending outbound traffic without any incoming traffic to cause it (flood other IP's) the hacker probably won't mask his source address by spoofing during the hack and you need my solution. There is no harm in combining the solutions either way, so...By the way, if your server is getting flooded chances are you know the attacker and he's got issues with your server (kicked/banned), with you personally (argument), or both.Edit: tried to clarify. Again: If your server starts sending out huge amounts of traffic when there is incoming traffic from a lot of sources, your server is being flooded/ddossed by a botnet or by someone with issues. On the other hand, if your server starts sending out huge amounts of traffic without a lot of incoming traffic, your server got hacked and probably is now part of a botnet itself. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | | « *Last Edit: December 09, 2011, 03:05:08 AM by 7* » | Logged |  ---   I'm on the ten most wanted list, I've got it dead in the groove.My face is on every wanted poster in town, for the way I move. | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Did you piss off anyone, e.g. banned him from your server?Is "the attack" just a shitload of incoming traffic or are those valid commands for your OA server, i.e. the "getstatus" command mentioned above? | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  | Logged |  ---   This space is for rent. | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Firstly, the e+ thread is talking about 500 packets per second and that's a considerable flood.Secondly, the solution presented in the e+ thread doesn't throttle the getstatus requests but completely drops them as soon as there are al least 5 getstatus requests within 2 seconds coming from the same IP.[Quote from: MilanFIN on December 09, 2011, 07:40:23 AM](http://openarena.ws/board/index.php?PHPSESSID=c5p4879u4ldrisuvpj514lehj2&topic=4391.msg41758#msg41758)-the attacks come from different ip adresses, at least 10min from one and then from another, and another and another...., so I think it is hard to be blocked via firewall.-When the bot or whatever finds the port, it will start sending stuff with 50kt/s to the computer, even if oa is not running...Yes, this is a botnet attack, you need WaspKillers solution.What's happening is the botnet is sending your server lots of requests for status information, but by faking the source address of the requests, your server won't send the requested status info to the bot that requested it but somebody else. Because the server status is a lot of information, you will send lots of data for every small getsatus packet you receive from the bots to that unlucky somebody who's IP the bots were spoofing and this will flood/ddos him.*So the attacks are not originating from the IP's you see but those are IPs of the victims. Basically the botnet is using Q3/OA servers to amplify its ddos attacks, and your server is one of those amplifiers.*Quote+ could it go off if I keep the server off for few weeks HuhProbably not, once you're on the botnet's list of servers, it's very hard to get off again.

It's nothing personal, they're just abusing your OA server. The 10 minute periods are typical for ddossing dsl and cable modems off the internet, so I'm pretty sure its a botnet and nothing personal. If it were personal and you were the ddos target instead of the amplifier, the source addresses would be much more random.QuoteUhm. Can someone give step-by-step to make the ip-banning system for too many requestes, still this is not about the oa, the strikes come ALWAYS, not only when oa-server is running.You can't do much about the incoming traffic from the bots, the only thing you can do is make sure your server is not flooding other people off the internet.I think the easiest way to go about the ip-banning system is to make a shell script and to run it every time your server boots. The script should contain the commands specified in the post on the e+ forum WaspKiller is talking about. But first you should check if your iptables has the 'u32' and 'recent' modules and if not you should install them.I'll write the script for you if you need more help, but I can't help you with installing the modules and such (I'm not an Ubuntu man).Edit: rewrote the script to be more genericCode:#!/bin/bashfunction numcommas () { local S="${1//[^,]/}" echo ${#S}}PORTS=${1:-27960}NUMPORTS=$(($(numcommas ${PORTS}) + 1))HITS=$((${2:-5} \* ${NUMPORTS}))SECONDS=${3:-2}iptables -N quake3\_ddosiptables -A quake3\_ddos -m u32 ! --u32 "0x1c=0xffffffff" -j ACCEPTiptables -A quake3\_ddos -m u32 --u32 "0x20=0x67657473&&0x24=0x74617475&&0x25&0xff=0x73" -m recent --name getstatus --setiptables -A quake3\_ddos -m recent --update --name getstatus --hitcount ${HITS} --seconds ${SECONDS} -j DROPiptables -A quake3\_ddos -j ACCEPTif [ ${NUMPORTS} -eq 1 ]; then iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport ${PORTS} -j quake3\_ddoselse iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dports ${PORTS} -j quake3\_ddosfiStore this somewhere as root (as /usr/local/bin/block\_q3dd for example), make it executable and call it on boot (in /etc/rc.local for example).The script has 3 optional parameters: a port or list of ports separated by comma's (default: 27960), how many requests per port are allowed (default: 5), and within what number of seconds (default:2). So if you've got 2 servers on port 27960 and 27961 and you want to drop getstatus packets at 3 requests per server per second or more you should call it this way in /etc/rc.local:Code:/usr/local/bin/block\_q3dd 27960,27961 3 1Edit 2: forgot a line in the script, it's correct now. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | | « *Last Edit: December 09, 2011, 02:00:14 PM by 7* » | Logged |  ---   I'm on the ten most wanted list, I've got it dead in the groove.My face is on every wanted poster in town, for the way I move. | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

If an IP sends a getstatus query it is put on a list, and if it occurs on that list more than the number of times you specify in the number of seconds you specify, further traffic from that IP is blocked (until te traffic from that IP drops under the limits you set).It's no use banning the attacking IPs completely, because:  * You're not really attacked from those IPs (they are [spoofed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack)) but those are actually the IPs of the hosts the botnet is attacking (and it's using your server to attack them). * The incoming packets are on your computer already before your iptables firewall can filter them, so blocking them with iptables won't do you any good. *You're blocking to avoid sending all the outbound traffic to the botnet's victims, because this could get you into trouble with the victims and/or with your ISP, and because hopefully the botnet will give up on using your server as an attack vector/amplifier after a while.* | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  | Logged |  ---   I'm on the ten most wanted list, I've got it dead in the groove.My face is on every wanted poster in town, for the way I move. | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Contacting your ISP is not always a good idea though, chances are your ISP will block all UDP traffic to your OA server ports (so your server will become unreachable to everybody) or worse, especially if you're not allowed to run servers over your connection in the first place (read the terms). | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  | Logged |  ---   I'm on the ten most wanted list, I've got it dead in the groove.My face is on every wanted poster in town, for the way I move. | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Hi All

seems that now also the UrT server are used as reflectors for a DRDoS attacks.

The usage of COD series servers as reflectors is done since about one year. The attacker sends spoofed packets with a status o serverinfo request to flood the IP of the "victim" server. The outgoing traffic is 5 - 10 times higher than the incoming traffic.

Did anybody noticed this increasing "reflection" activity in the last days?

I'm not sure if there is a way in iourt to limit the maximum number of requests to the server.

An experimental patch for the linux version of the COD4 linux server was released some months ago and it works fine, it could be interesting to implement something similar if not yet available.

Regards

Luca

look at rambetters SVN for a patch to the server code. You can limit the number of connect packets per ip address.

could you please be a little more specific on how to limit the packets per ip? i think im experiencing this attack the last 2 days...

iftop looks like this:

muehsam.trendless.net:27960 => customer.worldstream.nl:http 2.28Mb 1.81Mb 1.79Mb

most likely theres just 1 or two connections like this (various hosts) with outgoing rates between 1 and 5 mb/sec... this adds up to around 6-8gigs of traffic per day and the server lags occasionally. there is nothing in the logs.

technical background for this kind of attack can be found here: [http://www.lemuria.o...tion-drdos.html](http://www.lemuria.org/security/application-drdos.html "External link")

The iftop report is one of an attack, the server was used to flood a web server. If every server send's it's 2 megabit of traffic to the spoofed IP it's quite easy to reach a really high flooding traffic.

I think that he is talking about the following patch available in the SVN

I'm not sure if this will fix this kind of attack as it's mentioned the client connection but the server status and serverinfo are available via UDP even if you're not "connected".

==================

connectlimit.patch

==================

Introduces two new server cvars: sv\_limitConnectPacketsPerIP and

sv\_maxClientsPerIP. If sv\_limitConnectPacketsPerIP is set to any value

greater than zero, the server will ignore "connect" packets coming from a

single IP address in excess of four in the past six seconds. This is a

safeguard against a flood of connect packets from a single IP address source.

Hope to be able to build the server binary and try it.

thank you very much for your reply. i tried installing rambetters executable before your post yesterday but didnt find that patch you mentioned. i later found that there are two repositories,

svn://svn.clanwtf.net/repos/ioquake3-UrT-server-4.1

&

svn://svn.clanwtf.net/repos/ioUrT-server-4.1

the connectlimit.patch just exists for ioquake3-UrT-server-4.1!

so i compiled that one, but the issues are not resolved =/ i'm pretty sure sv\_limitConnectPacketsPerIP worked though, because b3 behaved strangely (announcing 'player from country connected' every single round)

any other ideas on how to stop this attacks instead of dropping the packets for every single host via iptables?

i think there are actually a lot more servers 'infected' with this exploit right now, the admins just didnt recognize it yet. the offender(s) should be getting the list of gameservers by querying the masterserver, so i would find it very unlikely if only farflame and me are suffering from it. to be clear: you wont be able to see anything in your gameserver-logs, there a no random people connecting or anything else. the only way to see if your server is affected is to monitor the traffic on the port(s) of your gameserver(s).

really hope there is a way to fix this,

apa

Since this is a problem with how the actual game code works... I would hazard that every UrT server on the master list is contributing to the ddos.

to be clear: you wont be able to see anything in your gameserver-logs, there a no random people connecting or anything else. the only way to see if your server is affected is to monitor the traffic on the port(s) of your gameserver(s).

We did notice regular "shark tail" yellow spikes on the netgraph and occasional connection interrupts while in play on the affected servers. So if you are seeing this out of nowhere... it could be an indication.

You're right. The "bug" it's in the core of Id's code. A lot of servers based on Id's code suffer this bug (COD, ET, Q3 ...).

What I've noticed is that it seems that the tool they use to flood the server has a minimum of logic in it. In the first attacks, taking into account also the ones versus for example COD2-4 servers, the spoofed ip's where used even if the server was empty. An empty server of course replies with a small status packet as no players are in. Now it seems that the attack starts only when the server has some players, in this way they take the maximum damage to the destination host as the reply status packet is bigger, and they maximize the use of their upload bandwidth.

I'm not sure about this but that's what i suppose.

Regarding the ability to stop attack using iptables I think that only combining length module and recent module but don't know if I have time to experiment. Should be something like what's reported [here](http://www.unix.com/security/106460-iptables-limit-incoming-udp-packets-certain-length.html "External link") and [here](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/iptables-configuration-for-udp-flood-864070/ "External link") but with some changes.

Have you read my post farflame?

If you get something with iptables let me know, despite isn't the best solution for all, because some people uses Windows, or uses a machine without root privileges.

Subject: openarena-server: is vulnerable for getstatus DRDoS attack
Date: Sun, 25 Mar 2012 01:10:13 +0100
```
Package: openarena-server
Version: 0.8.5-5+squeeze1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Dear Maintainer,

a few hours ago my openarena server was used for a distributed
reflected denial of service attack. I noticed unusual high outgoing
traffic on port 27960 (3MB/s) which was directed mainly towards
webservers in the beginning. The only solution was to shut down the
openarena-server or to create a new firewall rule.

After some investigation into the problem i discovered that it is well
known with Quake3 based engines. See [1], [2] and [3]

My server received many getstatus requests in a short amount of time
which were presumably faked by the real attacker.

The problem has also been discussed on the ioquake3 mailing list. [4]
One of the participants pointed out that a patch was introduced in 2010
which limits the rate of getstatus requests.[5] It might be a
potentially fix or at least mitigation for the attack.

I hope i could explain my problem understandably. That's all the
information i could gather so far.

An alternative way for preventing the DRDoS attack with iptables is described in [6].

Dear security team: what do you consider the severity of this bug to be?
Is it the sort of thing you issue DSAs for? (In this attack, the server
does not execute arbitrary code or reveal private data, but it can be
used for traffic-amplification as a DoS attack on someone else.)

Full text quoted in case this didn't already go to the security team.

openarena in wheezy/sid uses a newer ioquake3 engine which already has
this patch, mitigating the attack. I think that's the best we're likely
to be able to do within the constraints of the Q3 network protocol.

So the problem seems to be traffic amplification by a factor or 250.
(around 2000 bytes in, 500,000 bytes out).  Is this correct?

Is there any experience which strongly suggests that deploying the
patch actually helps victims?  Then we should issue a DSA.

Some proposed updates using the patch from ioquake3 are in my home
directory on alioth:
<<http://alioth.debian.org/~smcv/>>. Patch for review:
<<http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=pkg-games/openarena.git;a=commitdiff;h=caeb284533211bb0f76872279106a49306290168>>

Markus, if you install devscripts and debian-keyring, you should be able
to download the packages from Alioth with dget, and verify the
signatures on them by running dscverify on the .changes file (they're
signed with my GPG key, which is in the Debian keyring). URLs:

i386:
dget
[http://alioth.debian.org/~smcv/openarena_0.8.5-5+squeeze2~try1_i386.changes](http://alioth.debian.org/~smcv/openarena_0.8.5-5%2Bsqueeze2~try1_i386.changes)
amd64 and source:
dget
[http://alioth.debian.org/~smcv/openarena_0.8.5-5+squeeze2~try1_amd64.changes](http://alioth.debian.org/~smcv/openarena_0.8.5-5%2Bsqueeze2~try1_amd64.changes)

Verified on i386 to lock out rapid getstatus requests after an initial
"burst" of 10; if I'm reading the implementation correctly, after the
initial "burst" they limit getstatus to 1 per second per IP address or
10 per second across all addresses, and rcon to 1 per second. One
getstatus per second should be about 1 KB/sec outbound.

According to wireshark, using various commands on an unconfigured
squeeze "listen server" (1 player in the game, playing on the server
machine) has these amplification factors (I'm counting the size of the
IP packet, so excluding Ethernet headers):

command    in/bytes   out/bytes   amp.
--------------------------------------
getstatus  41         802         20x   (more on a config'd server?)
getinfo    39         172         4.4x
rcon       36         73          2x
getchallenge 44       61          < 2x
connect    39         71          < 2x  (minimal connect message)

The ioquake3 patch rate-limits getstatus because it has the largest
amplification (and the most scope for more amplification on a more
elaborately-configured server), and rcon (because its first argument is
a password to remote-control the game if that feature is enabled, and we
don't want to make it trivial to brute-force).

I'd be surprised to get a factor of 250: a minimal getstatus command
seems to be 41 bytes including IP headers, so 2000 bytes of input would
get you about 49 commands, which means each response would have to be
10204 bytes, nearly 10K, to provide that much output...

One of the ioquake3 developers noted in January that getinfo should have
rate-limiting too, but it's a considerably smaller amplification -
getinfo returns a small number of whitelisted variables, whereas
getstatus returns a set of variables that the server admin can
configure, AIUI - so nothing has been done about this by ioquake3
upstream yet.

Regards,
    S

Hi Simon,

thank you for your quick response and your detailed report. Both are
much appreciated. I have downloaded the amd64 package with dget and have
compared the actual openarena server in squeeze with the patched version
by monitoring the network traffic with iftop.

Although my dedicated openarena server with 4 bots has been offline for
more than 24h, the attacks resumed immediately. Once again the traffic
was directed towards web servers. This time i saw nearly 2MB/s outgoing
traffic to one target.

After i had installed your patched version the traffic dropped to 8kb/s.
In my opinion the patch is a vast improvement and mitigates the attack
efficiently. But i can't explain why there is such a difference between
your numbers and my observation though.

However i would be happy if you could upload the patched version to the
official repositories.

Regards
Markus

Uploaded, thanks. If you obtain a CVE number for this, please make sure
any advisory prominently mentions ioquake3 r1762 and/or this bug number.

Tremulous (contrib) seems to be vulnerable to the same thing... I'll
open a bug.

Here's some text for a general advisory, and some shorter text suitable
for a DSA:

--------------

It has been discovered that spoofed "getstatus" UDP requests are being
used by attackers[0][1][2][3] to direct status responses from multiple
Quake 3-based servers to a victim, as a traffic amplification mechanism
for a denial of service attack on that victim.

Open-source games derived from the Quake 3 engine are typically based on
ioquake3 [4], a popular fork of that engine. This vulnerability was
fixed in ioquake3 svn revision 1762 (January 2010) [5] by applying a
rate-limit to the getstatus request. Like several other known and fixed
vulnerabilities, it is not fixed in the latest official ioquake3 release
(1.36, April 2009).

If a CVE ID is allocated for this vulnerability, please reference
ioquake3 r1762 prominently in any advisory.

Fixed versions of various open-source games based on Quake III Arena,
mostly based on visual inspection of their source code:

* ioquake3 svn >= r1762
* OpenArena >= 0.8.8
* OpenArena engine snapshot >= 0.8.x-20
* World of Padman >= 1.5.4
* Tremulous svn trunk >= r1953
* Tremulous svn, gpp branch >= r1955
* Smokin' Guns >= 1.1b4
* Smokin' Guns svn 1.1 branch >= r472

Vulnerable older versions include:

* ioquake3 engine 1.36
* OpenArena 0.8.5
* World of Padman 1.5
* Tremulous 1.1.0
* Tremulous Gameplay Preview 1 (GPP1)
* Smokin' Guns svn trunk at the time of writing (r181)

Proprietary games based on the Quake III Arena engine (Quake III Arena
when played using its official engine, Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and Jedi
Academy, Star Trek: Elite Force 1 & 2, etc.) are also likely to be
vulnerable.

Proprietary games being run under the ioquake3 engine (Quake III Arena
when using ioquake3, Urban Terror when using ioUrbanTerror, etc.) may be
vulnerable or not vulnerable, depending on the version of ioquake3 used.

It has been discovered that spoofed "getstatus" UDP requests are used by
attackers to direct status responses from multiple Quake 3-based servers
(such as OpenArena) to a victim, as a traffic amplification mechanism
for a denial of service attack on that victim.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-5+squeeze2.

For the testing and unstable distributions (wheezy/sid), this problem is
fixed in all released versions of the ioquake3 package, which are used
by version 0.8.5-6 or later of the openarena package.

Package        : openarena
Vulnerability  : UDP traffic amplification
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-5077
Debian Bug     : 665656

It has been discovered that spoofed "getstatus" UDP requests are being
sent by attackers to servers for use with games derived from the
Quake 3 engine (such as openarena).  These servers respond with a
packet flood to the victim whose IP address was impersonated by the
attackers, causing a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-5+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.8.5-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your openarena packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## What is *ioquake3*?

*ioquake3* is a free and open-source software first person shooter engine based on the *Quake 3: Arena* and *Quake 3: Team Arena* source code. The source code is licensed under the [GPL version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), and was first released under that license by [id software](http://www.idsoftware.com/) on August 20th, 2005. Since then, our dedicated team has working hard to improve it, fixing bugs, and adding just the right new features to make the engine even better than before.

## What can I do with *ioquake3*?

You can [use it to play *Quake 3: Arena*](http://ioquake3.org/get-it/)*, Quake 3: Team Arena*, and the mods people have made for those games. See our [Player’s Guide](https://ioquake3.org/help/players-guide/) for instructions and help playing *ioquake3*, or our [SysAdmin Guide](https://ioquake3.org/help/sys-admin-guide/) to get started running your own game server. Or [play a game](https://ioquake3.org/extras/derivative-games/) that other great teams using ioquake3 have made if you don’t already have *Quake 3*.
You can also make your own game from [our source code in git on *gibhub*](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3/).

If you like *ioquake3* and you’d like to give back or get involved, excellent, we could use your help!
