Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the articles, which appears to be related to CVE-2010-5167:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability, dubbed the "argument-switch" attack, exploits a race condition in how antivirus (AV) software uses kernel-mode hooks, specifically System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks, to intercept and analyze system calls in Windows.
*   AV software often hooks into the OS kernel to inspect system calls before they are executed, allowing it to detect malicious behavior. The attack takes advantage of the timing differences between multiple threads on multi-core processors, manipulating the arguments of the system call at the last moment after the AV has performed its initial checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SSDT Hooking Vulnerability**: The core weakness lies in the AV software's reliance on SSDT hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks for security features.
*   **Race Condition:**  A race condition arises when the AV software validates an action on one thread, but before the action is executed, another thread alters the parameters to contain malicious content that was not checked by the AV software.
*   **Timing Dependency**: The exploit relies on precise timing. The benign code must be initially validated, then swapped with malicious code just before execution.
*   **Lack of Multi-Thread Awareness**: AV software threads are unable to properly track changes of arguments in other threads that are running simultaneously.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **AV Bypass:** The primary impact is the ability to bypass AV software protections, allowing malware to execute undetected.
*   **Malware Installation:**  Attackers can leverage the exploit to install malicious code, even if the user has limited privileges.
*   **AV Disablement:** The exploit can also be used to disable or remove AV software.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the article does not directly state privilege escalation, it does say a user with limited rights could kill an AV process that should only be controlled by an admin, this could be an indirect form of privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Binary Execution:** The attack requires the attacker to be able to execute a binary on the target machine.
*   **Exploit Combination:** The article suggests that the technique is best combined with an exploit of another piece of software like a vulnerable PDF reader or JVM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Run Code**: The attacker must be able to run code on the targeted machine. This could be achieved by exploiting a vulnerability in another application.
*   **Code Injection**: The attacker needs to inject malicious code into the process after the AV software has performed its initial checks and before execution.
*   **Timing Control**: The attacker needs precise timing to switch out the benign arguments with malicious arguments.
*   **Understanding of Kernel Internals**: A good understanding of the Windows Kernel, SSDT hooks, and multithreading is necessary to craft this attack.

**Additional Points:**

*   The article mentions that "100% of the tested products were found vulnerable" because of their use of SSDT hooks, highlighting the widespread nature of this vulnerability at the time.
*   The technique is described as requiring a large amount of code, making it unsuitable for quick, stealthy shellcode-based attacks. However, combining it with a different vulnerability could make it more effective.
*   The article from F-Secure Labs indicates that while this attack can bypass some layers of their protection, their multi-layered approach should provide a sufficient level of security. They also note that they can add signature detection for such attacks if they see it being used in the wild.

In summary, the "argument-switch" attack is a sophisticated method to bypass antivirus protections by exploiting a race condition between threads that uses a technique of swapping out a benign payload with a malicious one at the last moment. The attacker requires the ability to run code on the victim's machine and precise timing, but the impact can be significant, allowing undetected malware installations. This is further corroborated by the F-Secure article which references Matousec's findings.
