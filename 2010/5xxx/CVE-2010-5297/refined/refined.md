  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2010-5297",
      "related_content": true,
      "summary": "The provided content relates to a bug fix in WordPress version 3.0.1, specifically addressing an issue where the 'add_new_users' multisite option could not be turned off once enabled. This corresponds to ticket #14119.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause was that the 'add_new_users' option was not properly being saved as disabled when a super admin attempted to turn it off, after having previously enabled it.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of boolean option states",
         "Multisite configuration logic"
      ],
      "impact": "The primary impact of the vulnerability was the inability to restrict the addition of new users by site administrators in a WordPress multisite installation. This could lead to unintended user creation and potentially increase the attack surface.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is not directly exploitable in a traditional sense. It stems from a flaw in the administrative interface that handles multisite settings. An attacker would need to already have super administrator level access on the wordpress instance to trigger the vulnerability by modifying the setting, which would then make it impossible to disable via UI.",
       "required_capabilities": "To 'exploit' this, the attacker (in this case a super admin) would require the ability to modify network options."
