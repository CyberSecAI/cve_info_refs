{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an off-by-one error in the range check within the `radeon_atom_get_tv_timings` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_atombios.c`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect array bounds check leading to potential buffer overflow."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could potentially lead to a buffer overflow. However, the Red Hat Bugzilla entry states that the flaw cannot be influenced by an attacker and it's not present in any currently supported versions of Fedora. The function in question is called with hardcoded indices, preventing a user-controlled overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerable code is in the Linux kernel's Radeon graphics driver. The function is called with hardcoded indices, which does not allow for direct user influence.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to somehow influence the hardcoded index passed to the vulnerable function. However, as the index is hardcoded, the vulnerability is not exploitable. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry states that this flaw is cannot be influenced by an attacker."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The fix involves changing the array size to match the new maximum number of supported TV timings and correcting the array bounds check in the `radeon_atom_get_tv_timings` function from `>` to `>=`. This bug is present in Linux kernel version 2.6.34. The Red Hat Bugzilla entry notes that the issue was fixed for Fedora in 2.6.34 and was never present in any supported version of Fedora. Red Hat has determined not to fix this flaw due to its non-exploitable nature."
