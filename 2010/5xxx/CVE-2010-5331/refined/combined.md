| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1743598#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-08-20 09:48:09 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel, a range check issue in drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atombios.c could cause an off by one (buffer overflow) problem.  Reference: <https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.34> <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0031c41be5c529f8329e327b63cde92ba1284842> <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0031c41be5c529f8329e327b63cde92ba1284842>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1743598#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-08-20 09:48:57 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1743600](show_bug.cgi?id=1743600 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-5331 kernel: range check issue in drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atombios.c leads to buffer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1743598#c2)  Justin M. Forbes    2019-08-20 12:54:24 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora in 2.6.34, and never present in any currently supported version of Fedora.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1743598#c3)  Wade Mealing    2020-02-20 03:21:44 UTC  ``` Some background:  This would only affect systems with the Radeon series graphics cards, Nvidia, Intel, and other graphics card vendors that are not affected by this flaw.  The "AtomBIOS" is a section of PCI configuration space (has a likeness to ACPI)  where the operating system can use the code stored there to issue commands for the AMD video card to configure itself.  These commands provide a method for the driver to configure the graphics card without having to know the specific registers and values to write on a per-card basis.  But I digress, I think that this CVE is incorrectly assigned it should be disputed.  The problem:  bool radeon_atom_get_tv_timings(struct radeon_device *rdev, int index,  <-- THIS VALUE - INDEX                                 struct drm_display_mode *mode) {  <snip>  +		if (index >= MAX_SUPPORTED_TV_TIMING)  <snip>  }   ^ The fix is to check that the index is not greater than a hardcoded value.  So, lets take a look at how that's called, in two places:   1) atombios_encoders.c radeon_atom_mode_fixup	 line 333 radeon_atom_get_tv_timings(rdev, 0, adjusted_mode); 2) atombios_encoders.c radeon_atom_mode_fixup	 line 335 radeon_atom_get_tv_timings(rdev, 1, adjusted_mode);  Index, the second parameter is -hard coded- which as far as I can see as declared in atombios.h, so I checked that maybe it was user controllable at some time, it was introduced in commit 3f03ced880879 and never changed, so.. maybe MAX_SUPPORTED_TV_TIMING was different at some point ?  So lets look for that..  4193 #define MAX_SUPPORTED_TV_TIMING 2  Which was added by the commit 771fe6b912fca, which is the initial introduction of this patch. This value has never changed.  I have written to Mitre to reject this CVE on this grounds, It is my recommendation that Red Hat not fix this flaw as it a misuse of engineering time.  References: <https://wiki.osdev.org/AMD_Atombios> <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/gpu/drm-kms.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1743598#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-02-20 08:09:34 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2010-5331>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1743598#c6)  Eric Christensen    2020-02-27 14:03:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat will not be fixing this flaw as it has been analyzed as not affecting any version of Linux.   ``` |  |
