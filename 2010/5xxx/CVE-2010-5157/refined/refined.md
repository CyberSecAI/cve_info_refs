Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way anti-virus (AV) software uses System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks in Windows to intercept and inspect system calls. The vulnerability is based on a "race condition" exploit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SSDT/Kernel Hooking:** The AV software relies on hooking system calls to monitor and control program behavior, which is a common practice for security software.
*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability arises from a race condition in multi-core processor systems. One thread is often unable to track the actions of simultaneously running threads.
*   **Argument Switching:** The core weakness is that AV software can be tricked by sending benign code that passes inspection initially, then rapidly switching to malicious code before execution. This "argument switch" occurs after the AV check but before execution, effectively bypassing the AV's protective measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **AV Bypass:** The primary impact is the ability to bypass the detection capabilities of AV software, allowing malware to execute undetected.
*   **Malware Installation:** The exploit enables the installation of malware on the target system, even under limited user privileges.
*   **AV Disabling:** The attack can also be used to disable the running AV software, even by a user without administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Binary Execution:** The attacker must have the ability to run a binary on the targeted PC. This could be achieved by using another exploit, such as a vulnerability in PDF readers, Java, or other vulnerable software, to deliver the initial benign code payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Execution:** The attacker needs the capability to execute code on the target machine, whether it's through a separate exploit, or social engineering etc.
*   **Timing Control:** The attacker has to have some control of timing to correctly switch benign code for the malicious payload at the right time.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at `matousec.com`.
*   Multiple AV products from major vendors such as McAfee, Trend Micro, AVG, and BitDefender were found to be vulnerable.
*   The attack is effective against systems with multi-core processors.
*   The technique requires loading a large amount of code onto the target machine.
