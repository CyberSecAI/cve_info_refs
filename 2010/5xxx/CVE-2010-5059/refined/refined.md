Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-5059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the CMScout 2.08 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `album` parameter in the `index.php?page=photos` URL is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data from the database, and potentially modify or delete data, including user credentials such as usernames and passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL that injects SQL code into the vulnerable `album` parameter.
   - Example: `http://server/index.php?page=photos&album=-1+UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,concat(uname,0x3a,passwd),3,4,5+from+sn_users--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable CMScout application. No authentication or special privileges are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit targets the `sn_users` table, suggesting that user information is stored within this table and is accessible through the SQL injection.
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a working exploit URL and a more specific vulnerable file, which is `index.php?page=photos&album=[parameter]`.
- The exploit utilizes a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to extract data from the database by concatenating the username and password fields from the `sn_users` table.
- The exploit explicitly references the injection of `concat(uname,0x3a,passwd)` to retrieve username/password combinations.
- The exploit also includes a dork to assist in finding vulnerable targets: `Powered by CMScout (c)2005 CMScout Group`
