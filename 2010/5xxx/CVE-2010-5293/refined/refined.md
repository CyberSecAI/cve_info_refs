Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the changes in WordPress 3.0.2:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause was a flaw in the pingback/trackback comment whitelisting feature within WordPress. This feature, when enabled, would automatically approve pingback or trackback comments if the domain of the referring URL was present in the blogroll links. The vulnerability stemmed from using a `LIKE` SQL query that searched for the domain string anywhere within the blogroll link URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Domain Check:** The vulnerability was in the way WordPress was checking if a pingback/trackback domain was in the blogroll. It used a `LIKE` SQL query with `%` wildcards, which would match any blogroll link containing the supplied domain as a substring. This allowed for easy bypass, as a malicious actor could submit a pingback/trackback with a URL containing a domain that exists within other links present in the blogroll and get their content approved.
2. **Abuse of Whitelisting**: The whitelisting mechanism was vulnerable to abuse because it was checking for domains rather than specific URLs. This meant that a domain like "wordpress.org" in a malicious trackback URL such as "http://wordpress.org/foobar123" would still bypass the checks if "wordpress.org" was in the blogroll.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spam Injection**: The primary impact was that attackers could bypass comment moderation and inject spam or other undesirable content into the comment section of the WordPress website.
*   **Content Manipulation**: By crafting malicious trackback/pingback URLs, attackers could have their unwanted content automatically approved and displayed on the target website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Pingback/Trackback**: The attack vector was through the pingback or trackback mechanism of WordPress. An attacker could craft a malicious pingback/trackback with a URL containing a domain that would bypass comment moderation due to the flawed whitelisting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Pingbacks/Trackbacks**: The attacker needed the ability to send pingbacks or trackbacks to the target WordPress site.
* **Knowledge of Blogroll Links:** An attacker would need to craft a URL that contains a domain string that also exists within a blogroll link of the target website in order to bypass the whitelist.
*   **No Special Access Required**: The attacker didn't need any special privileges on the WordPress site itself; the vulnerability could be exploited from an external source.

**Resolution:**

The vulnerability was addressed by completely removing the pingback/trackback blogroll whitelisting feature, as the feature was deemed too easily abused.

This removal is documented in changeset [16637](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/16637) and [16638](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/16638). Ticket #13887 also provides details on the vulnerability and its resolution.
