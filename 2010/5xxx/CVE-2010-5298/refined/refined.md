    "description": "Race condition in the ssl3_read_bytes function in s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL through 1.0.1g, when SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS is enabled, allows remote attackers to inject data across sessions or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and parsing error) via an SSL connection in a multithreaded environment.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition in the ssl3_read_bytes function, specifically when the `SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS` option is enabled.",
      "weaknesses": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper management of a buffer in a multithreaded environment.",
      "impact": "Data injection across sessions, denial of service (use-after-free leading to parsing error), or application crash.",
      "attack_vectors": "Remote attacker via an SSL connection in a multithreaded environment.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to initiate SSL connections and exploit the race condition. The application using OpenSSL must have `SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS` enabled."
