```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A stack buffer overflow exists in the `Image2PDF()` function of the NImage Viewer CP Gold ActiveX Control 5.5.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: Sending an overly long string to the `Image2PDF()` property of the ImageViewer2.ocx ActiveX control through a specially crafted HTML page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page which the victim needs to visit using a vulnerable browser with the vulnerable ActiveX control installed.
