The provided content describes a vulnerability, dubbed "argument-switch" attack, that bypasses anti-virus (AV) protections by exploiting how AV software uses driver hooks in the Windows operating system. This aligns with the general description of CVE-2010-5177 which involves bypassing antivirus software.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the way AV software uses System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) or similar kernel-mode hooks to monitor system calls.
- The core issue is a race condition in multi-core processors where one thread can't reliably track other simultaneously running threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **SSDT/Kernel Hook Exploitation:** AV software utilizes SSDT hooks to modify the OS kernel to inspect system calls. This is the primary weakness.
-   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability relies on a race condition where an attacker can swap out a benign code sample with a malicious one after it has passed AV checks but before it is executed.
-   **Multi-core processor reliance:** The race condition is made more reliable by the fact the many modern systems run on multi core processors, causing the various threads to not keep track of each other.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Bypassing AV Protection:** The attack bypasses most traditional AV signature-based detection, allowing new or unknown malware to execute.
-   **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware or remove the AV software altogether.
-   **Privilege Escalation (potentially):** A user with limited privileges could potentially use the attack to kill an installed AV, which usually requires administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack requires an attacker to already have the ability to run a binary on the targeted PC.
-   The attack is not suitable for shellcode-based attacks due to the large amount of code that needs to be loaded.
- It can be used in combination with the exploitation of another vulnerability like a vulnerable PDF reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   Ability to execute code on the target machine.
-   The attacker needs to craft a specific sequence of code where a benign sample is swapped by malicious code at just the right time in order to bypass the AV.
-   The ability to exploit a race condition and perform the swap.

**Additional Information:**

-   The technique is referred to as an "argument-switch" attack.
-   The attack affects many popular AV products including those from McAfee, Trend Micro, AVG, and BitDefender.
-   It can be effective even when Windows is running under a user with limited privileges.
