# Plugging the CSS History Leak

mozilla
March 31, 2010

[67 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2010/03/31/plugging-the-css-history-leak/#comments)

### Privacy isn’t always easy.

We’re close to landing some changes in the Firefox development tree that will fix a privacy leak that browsers have been struggling with for some time. We’re really excited about this fix, we hope other browsers will follow suit. It’s a tough problem to fix, though, so I’d like to describe how we ended up with this approach.

#### History Sniffing

![Visited and Unvisited Links](//blog.mozilla.org/security/files/2010/03/visitedunvisited.png "visitedunvisited")Links can look different on web sites based on whether or not you’ve visited the page they reference. You’ve probably seen this before: in some cases, visited links are purple instead of blue. This is just one of the many features web designers use to make the web the best it can be, and for the most part that’s a good thing.

The problem is that appearance can be detected by the page showing you links, cluing the page into which of the presented pages you’ve been to. The result: not only can you see where you’ve been, but so can the web site!

Originally specified as a useful feature for the Web, visited link styling has been part of the web for… well, forever. So this is a pretty old problem, and resurfaces every once in a while to generate [more](http://startpanic.com/) [paranoid](http://www.haveyourfriendsbeenthere.com/) [netizens](http://caughtyouwatching.com/).

The most obvious fix is to disable different styles for visited versus unvisted links, but this would be employed at the expense of utility: while sites can no longer figure out which links you’ve clicked, neither can you. David Baron has implemented [a way to help keep users’ data private while minimizing the effect on the web](http://dbaron.org/mozilla/visited-privacy), and we are deploying it to protect our users. We think this represents the best solution to the problem, and we’ll be delighted if other browsers approach this the same way.

### Technical Details.

The biggest threats here are the high-bandwidth techniques, or those that extract lots of information from users’ browsers quickly. These are particularly worrisome since they enable not only very focused attacks, but also the widespread brute-force attacks that are, in general, more useful to a variety of attackers (potentially including [fingerprinting](http://panopticlick.eff.org)).

The JavaScript function getComputedStyle() and its related functions are *fast* and can be used to guess visitedness at [hundreds of thousands of links per minute](http://cssfingerprint.com/results). To make it harder for web sites to figure out where you’ve been without radically changing the web, we’re approaching the way we style links in three fairly subtle ways:

**Change 1: Layout-Based Attacks**

First of all, we’re limiting what types of styling can be done to visited links to differentiate them from unvisited links. Visited links can only be different in color: foreground, background, outline, border, SVG stroke and fill colors. All other style changes either leak the visitedness of the link by loading a resource or changing position or size of the styled content in the document, which can be detected and used to identify visited links.

While we are changing what is allowed in CSS, the CSS 2.1 specification takes into consideration how visited links can be abused:

> “UAs may therefore treat all links as unvisited links, or implement other measures to preserve the user’s privacy while rendering visited and unvisited links differently.” [[CSS 2 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/)]

**Change 2: Some Timing Attacks**

Next, we are changing some of the guts of our layout engine to provide a fairly uniform flow of execution to minimize differences in layout time for visited and unvisited links. The changes cause all styles to be resolved on all links for both visited and unvisited states, and it is stored; then, when the link is styled, the appropriate set of styles is chosen making the code paths for visited and unvisited links essentially the same length. This should eliminate some of the easy-to-mount timing attacks.

**Change 3: Computed Style Attacks**

JavaScript is not going to have access to the same style data it used to. When a web page tries to get the computed style of a link (or any of its sub-elements), Firefox will give it unvisited style values.

### What does this mean for users?

For the most part, users shouldn’t notice a change in how the web works. A few web sites may look a little different, but visited links will still show up differently colored. A few sites that use more than color to differentiate visited links may look slightly broken at first while they adjust to these changes, but we think it’s the right trade-off to be sure we protect our users’ privacy. This is a troubling and well-understood attack; as much as we hate to break any portion of the web, we need to shut the attack down to the extent we can.

We have to be realistic, though: there are many ways all browsers leak information about you, and fixing CSS history sniffing [will not block all of these leaks](http://dbaron.org/mozilla/visited-privacy#limits). But we believe it’s important to stop the scariest, most effective history attacks any way we can since it will be a big win for users’ privacy.

If the remaining attacks worry you, or you can’t wait for us to ship this fix, version 3.5 and newer versions of Firefox already allow you to disable all visited styling (immediately stops this attack) by setting the [layout.css.visited\_links\_enabled option in about:config to false](http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?locale=hu&comments_parentId=438422&forumId=1#threadId438464). While this will plug the history leak, you’ll no longer see any visited styling anywhere.

### Enhancing Privacy on the Web.

We want to bridge the gap between our users’ expectations of privacy and what actually happens on the web. Sometimes users have an expectation that we preserve their privacy a certain way, and if we can, we want to live up to it. Privacy isn’t a feature that can simply be added to a browser, though; it often comes at the expense of utility. We think we’ve found a fix that will balance flexibility for web developers while providing a safer experience for our users on the web.

      > @Matthew: Much of the history of this bug is available on bugzilla ([Bug 147777](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147777)). Most of the options considered are debated in the comments of that bug. We did consider many different approaches, but most of what we looked at either made the user’s experience *much* worse than this fix, or they turned off too many features that developers rely on (outside of just :visited styles).

    > Michael: “completely useless” is surely an exaggeration. Having said that, the Web is certainly just as useless in its current state, no? Web designers have been putting personal taste for aesthetics before the usability for others for a long time, so in truth, you’re already running into problems with low contrast or otherwise indistinguishable color palettes in the wild, right? And even amongst designers who do not fit in those categories, the number of designers who put icons or even non-color types of text decoration in their style sheet to distinguish visited links is by far outnumbered by those who only specify color.

It seems like it would be a shame if add-ons didn’t have an easy way to get at that information; I know the DOM Inspector uses the DOM 2 Style API in question for the computed style viewer. (Certainly no problem if you’re only interested in seeing exactly what is going to be seen by script, but if that’s not your use case, then a problem does arise.) And it would probably be most beneficial to have a separate method rather than a whitelisting effect for chrome, in case your add-on *is* interested in seeing exactly what script will see.

    > Sid, it’s also interesting that you say you “hope other browsers will follow suit”, since the approach makes it seem more like a (belated) temporary stopgap than a permanent solution, and will potentially be subject to future progress which could retain more of the current functionality to be exposed to authors—contingent upon some untangling in /layout that would make such things possible.

       > @Colby: I wouldn’t call this fix a temporary stopgap, unless you are hoping this it a stepping stone towards removing browser history entirely, which I doubt would be welcomed with open arms. With the text you quoted, I was saying how I’d like to see more adoption of the fundamental approach: blocking history from arbitrary web sites, but still letting users themselves see it. The point is to match up what the browser does with what users think it does. Browser history is widely perceived as something that’s just part of the browser–not transmitted to sites–and this patch is intended to make it that way.

For the majority of sites which fully control all pages on their domain, your suggested changes do not provide any additional privacy protection since all of that history can be tracked on the server. But the changes would prevent creative and useful applications of CSS. (Sites where untrusted third parties are hosted under the same domain, e.g., apps.facebook.com, would be the exception — but Facebook controls what JS can run and can easily protect against this themselves.)

Privacy is a personal responsibility; giving people the tools to enhance their privacy is one thing, but using hamhanded techniques like this is unlikely to help very much and may cause headaches for designers and developers who legitimately use the features you’re about to axe. If you really want people to have better privacy, just give them better user interface tools to protect it. You could do things like provide a button in the main UI to block the presently visited site from appearing in history, another to block the present site from accessing history information, and another to clear all history. Give them more granular control of what kinds of things get saved to history and for how long via an intuitive control panel.

     > Pat from AddToAny. We’ve deployed this technique on our sharing widget for years (search for “addtoany smart menu”) so this does indeed affect us and over 100,000 publishers. Personally, I’m okay with plugging this hole to a certain degree, but the aforementioned seems like a silver-bullet approach with too many developer implications.

It’s a marvelous use-case, I might add. 😉 200 queries is not “high-bandwidth” as defined above, but it’s noteworthy. Just FYI the results are used on runtime, client-side only.

Not sure about LiveJournal, but most sites of this nature don’t permit arbitrary JavaScript due to a slew of issues extending beyond this one.

     > Can’t Mozilla simply disable the ability of javascript to determine all the styles on visited links instead of disallowing those styles?

        > @Bruce: if we just disabled access via JS, that wouldn’t solve any of the timing attacks or the non-JS CSS-based attacks (those that rearrange the DOM, resize things, or create requests for images). For example, take a look at <http://browser-recon.info>. The fact that there are so many ways to access the history, with and without JS, makes it necessary to address the capabilities and not just the information presented to JS.
