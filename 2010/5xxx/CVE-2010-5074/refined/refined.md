The provided content discusses a privacy vulnerability related to CSS styling of visited links, which is a known issue and the basis for CVE-2010-5074. The blog post details how Mozilla is addressing this vulnerability in Firefox.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The ability to style visited links differently from unvisited links using CSS allows websites to detect which links a user has visited. This information can be used to infer user browsing history.
- The `getComputedStyle()` JavaScript function and related functions could be used to rapidly check the styles of many links and infer visited links, thus, extracting history data.
- High-bandwidth techniques can be used to extract large amounts of history data from users quickly.
- Timing differences in how visited and unvisited links are styled can be exploited to determine link visitedness.
- Layout-based attacks that use changes in position, size, or resource loading can reveal visited links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSS Styling:** The core weakness is the ability to apply different styles to visited and unvisited links, allowing detection of visited links.
- **JavaScript API:** The `getComputedStyle()` function allows scripts to query link styles, enabling fast and widespread history detection.
- **Timing Attacks:** Differences in the time it takes to style visited and unvisited links can be measured to reveal visited links.
- **Layout Manipulation:** Changes in the layout of visited links (e.g., size, position) can be detected and used for history sniffing.
- **Resource Loading:** Loading different resources (e.g., background images) for visited links can also be a giveaway.
- **Pixel Color Querying (Indirectly):**  APIs that allow querying of pixel colors, possibly related to SVG, could be used to detect the colors of visited links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Leakage:** Websites can learn which pages a user has visited, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Targeted Attacks:** Attackers can use this information to craft phishing attacks, target ads, or identify users based on their browsing habits.
- **Price Manipulation:** Online stores could adjust prices based on user browsing habits.
- **Profiling:** User browsing history can be used to build a profile for tracking, discrimination, or other malicious purposes.
- **Outing:**  Sensitive personal information, such as sexual orientation or political views, can be inferred.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSS Styling:** Using the :visited CSS pseudo-class to differentiate the appearance of visited links from non-visited links.
- **JavaScript:** Utilizing JavaScript functions like `getComputedStyle()` to read styles of links.
- **Timing:** Exploiting the differences in time taken to apply styles to visited and unvisited links.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Changing the layout or loading of resources based on the visited status.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the content of a webpage viewed by the victim. This can be achieved by hosting a malicious website or injecting malicious code into a legitimate website.
- The attacker would not need any privileged access to the user's system or browser.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the user's browser (though CSS-only attacks are also possible).

**Mitigation:**
- **Limiting CSS Styling:** Only allowing color changes for visited links, and not allowing layout, size, or resource changes.
- **Uniform Layout Processing:** Resolving styles for visited and unvisited links and storing the result before applying them to ensure code path is the same length and mitigate timing attacks.
- **Restricting JavaScript Access:**  JavaScript will only see the unvisited style values for links even if they are visited.
- **User Config:** Allowing users to disable the :visited styling via a config setting.
