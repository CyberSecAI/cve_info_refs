Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-5036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The iScripts eSwap v2.0 application is vulnerable to both SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is susceptible to SQL injection vulnerabilities within the `addsale.php` script when handling the `type` parameter. This indicates that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS through the search functionality. This occurs when the search field input is not sanitized and allows arbitrary javascript code to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain control of the application or the server hosting the database.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting:** Successful XSS could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser
    *   Steal session cookies
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites
    *   Deface the website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The SQL injection is located in the `addsale.php` script, specifically through the `type` parameter in the URL (e.g., `http://[site]/eswap/demo/addsale.php?type=[SQLi]`).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** The XSS vulnerability is found in the search field (e.g., `http://[site]/eswap/demo/search.php`). An example payload is  `'"--><script>alert(0x000872)</script>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as both vulnerabilities appear to be accessible without authentication.
