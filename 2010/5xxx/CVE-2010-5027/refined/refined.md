Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2010-5027

**Vulnerability:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The application "Science Fair In A Box" (SFIAB) has vulnerabilities in its `winners.php` script that allow for both SQL Injection and XSS attacks due to improper handling of user-supplied input, particularly within the `year` and `type` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `type` parameter in `winners.php` which isn't properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** The application is vulnerable to XSS, also in `winners.php` which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Javascript code via the `type` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `type` parameter within the `winners.php` script through a crafted URL. Example: `http://server/sfiab/winners.php?year=2008&type=Special'`
- **XSS:** The `type` parameter within the `winners.php` script through a crafted URL. Example: `http://server/sfiab/winners.php?year=2008&type=Special [xss]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SFIAB application.
- No special user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found in version 2.0.6 of the software.
- The vulnerable software is developed using PHP with a MySQL backend.
