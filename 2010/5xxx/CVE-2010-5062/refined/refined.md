Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-5062:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `search.php` file of the mhproducts Kleinanzeigenmarkt application. The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed through the `c` parameter in the URL, leading to the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `c` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database compromise: An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. This includes user credentials (usernames, passwords) and potentially other confidential data stored in the database.
- Data Modification: Attackers could potentially alter or delete data within the database.
- Full server compromise: In some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be leveraged to achieve further control over the server by executing arbitrary commands if the database user has the necessary privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `search.php` file by manipulating the `c` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of basic SQL syntax to craft malicious queries that can be injected.
- No authentication is required, the vulnerability is exposed to unauthenticated users.

**Technical details**
- The exploit examples demonstrate how an attacker can inject SQL queries using the `UNION SELECT` operator to retrieve user data.
- The specific examples provided focus on extracting the `name` and `password` fields from the `users` table using `convert(name using utf8)` and `convert(password using utf8)`. Also, the `concat` function is used to extract multiple fields at once.
- The examples use a numeric value `-999999` as a placeholder to ensure the `UNION` query executes properly.
- A comment terminator `--+` is used to prevent syntax errors in the injected SQL query.
