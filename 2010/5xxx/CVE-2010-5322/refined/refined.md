Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Zeuscart v.4:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application lacks proper input sanitization and output encoding, leading to multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `search`, `schltr`, and `brand` in `index.php`.
    *   Arbitrary HTML and JavaScript can be injected via these parameters.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   Vulnerable parameters in the administrative backend: `id` (in `disporders` and `subadminmgt`), and `cid` (in `editcurrency`).
    *   Arbitrary SQL statements can be injected via these parameters.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   The `getphpinfo` functionality in the administrative backend exposes PHP settings via `phpinfo()`.
    *   This functionality is accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
*   **SQLi:** An attacker can:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain administrative access to the application.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive server information via `phpinfo()`, which could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Crafting malicious links and tricking users into clicking them.
*   **SQLi:** Directly manipulating HTTP requests to inject SQL code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing the `getphpinfo` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   Ability to craft malicious URLs and get users to interact with them.
*   **SQLi:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the administrative backend.
    *   No prior authentication needed for some of the SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the application's admin panel.
    *   No authentication required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor was notified but did not fully resolve the vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory (SROEADV-2015-12) and technical details were publicly released.
*   The vulnerabilities affect Zeuscart v.4.
