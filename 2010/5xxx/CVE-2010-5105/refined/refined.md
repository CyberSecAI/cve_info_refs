Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2010-5105:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Blender's use of a predictable temporary file path `/tmp/quit.blend` for saving session recovery data when the application is closed without saving changes. This file is created regardless of whether the user has write permissions in the `/tmp` directory or not.
- Specifically, the issue arises when an attacker creates a symbolic link at `/tmp/quit.blend` pointing to an arbitrary file owned by the victim. When Blender attempts to save its recovery data to `/tmp/quit.blend`, it unknowingly overwrites the target file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure temporary file handling:** Blender uses a fixed, predictable path in `/tmp` for its recovery file. This makes it vulnerable to symlink attacks.
- **Lack of proper permission checks:** Blender does not verify if the path is a symbolic link or if the target file is owned by the user. It proceeds to overwrite the file without performing necessary checks.
- **Re-occurrence of previously fixed issue:**  This vulnerability is a reoccurrence of CVE-2008-1103, indicating a failure to properly maintain the fix in subsequent releases.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary file overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file the victim has write access to by creating a symlink to that file at `/tmp/quit.blend`. The contents of the file will be replaced with Blender's session recovery data, leading to data loss or corruption.
- **Potential denial of service:** If multiple users have symlinks pointing to the same file, it could cause issues with the autosave functionality. (Though the primary impact is arbitrary file overwrite, the related denial of service is also present).

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local access required:** The attacker must have local access to the system to create the malicious symbolic link in `/tmp`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to create a symbolic link at `/tmp/quit.blend` before the victim launches and exits blender without saving.
- The attacker must know, or be able to predict, a path to a file the victim owns to target with the symbolic link
- No special privileges are needed for the attack, the victim running blender is enough.

**Additional details:**

-  The vulnerability was initially reported in 2010, but persisted across multiple Blender releases. The issue was fixed previously in Debian, but the fixes were dropped in later versions, and upstream was initially dismissive of the security implications.
-  The problem was incorrectly fixed by just preventing overwriting of the symlink, which results in a denial of service instead of data corruption. A proper fix should avoid writing to `/tmp` and instead use a secure location within the user's home directory or a random path using `mkstemp`.
