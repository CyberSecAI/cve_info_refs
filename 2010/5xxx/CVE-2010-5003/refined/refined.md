Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2010-5003:

**CVE-2010-5003: Joomla! Component AutarTimonial 1.0.8 - SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `limit` parameter of the `com_autartimonial` component. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code directly into the query.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which can enable attackers to manipulate database queries.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
        *   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive data stored in the Joomla database.
        *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection can allow an attacker to gain administrative privileges.
        *   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration and system privileges, a complete compromise of the server could be possible.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable Joomla component. Specifically, the attacker modifies the `limit` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Vulnerable URL:** `http://www.site.com/index.php?option=com_autartimonial&view=autartimonial&limit=[sqli]` demonstrates the vulnerable URL.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the target Joomla website.
    *   **Basic Web Knowledge:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL injection techniques.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be performed without any prior authentication to the Joomla application

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a classic SQL injection that is easy to exploit and can have significant consequences, which could allow an attacker to gain access or manipulate the database behind a Joomla installation.
