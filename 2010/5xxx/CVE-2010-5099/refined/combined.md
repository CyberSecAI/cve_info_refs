"I've forgotten your password, could you please remind me?"

### [TYPO3-SA-2010-020, TYPO3-SA-2010-022 explained](http://blog.nibblesec.org/2010/12/typo3-sa-2010-020-typo3-sa-2010-022.html)

On 16th December, TYP03 released a new security update ([TYPO3-SA-2010-022](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2010-022/)) for their content management system. Apparently, this web-based framework is widely used in [many important websites](http://blogue.infoglobe.ca/2008/10/22/51-typo3-sites-which-you-may-not-have-known-were-typo3-based/).
Within this update, TYPO3 team fixed a vulnerability that I've discovered a few weeks ago. In detail, this discovery pertains to a previous vulnerability fixed in [TYPO3-SA-2010-020](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2010-020/) and discovered by Gregor Kopf.

TYP03 decided to follow a policy of least disclosure. Although it's an Open Source project, no technical details are available in the wild besides these ([1](http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2010-020/),[2](http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=15898)). As I strongly believe that this practice does not improve the overall security (as mentioned in a [previous post](http://blog.nibblesec.org/2010/12/unspecified-vulnerabilities.html)), I've decided to briefly explain this interesting flaw.

From the advisory, we can actually deduce two important concepts:
> A Remote File Disclosure vulnerability in the jumpUrl mechanism [..] Because of a non-typesafe comparison between the submitted and the calculated hash, it is possible [..]

In a nutshell, the JumpUrl mechanism allows to track access on web pages and provided files (e.g. /index.php?id=2&type=0&jumpurl=/etc/passwd&juSecure=1&locationData=2%3a&juHash=2b1928bfab)

The patch (see this [shell script](http://typo3.org/fileadmin/security-team/bug15898/fix_15898.sh)) simply replaces the two equal signs with three (loose vs strict comparisons).

That's the affected code:
[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5TMxqPSTp9k/TRtMAaF_hZI/AAAAAAAACiw/9Xes12EUHIE/s400/typo3code.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5TMxqPSTp9k/TRtMAaF_hZI/AAAAAAAACiw/9Xes12EUHIE/s1600/typo3code.jpg)

Having this knowledge, it is probably clear to the reader that the overall goal is to bypass the comparison between $juHash and $calcJuHash. While the former is user supplied (string or array), the latter is derived from a substr(md5\_value,10) (string).

In PHP, comparisons involving numerical strings result in unexpected behaviors (at least for me before studying this [chapter](http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php)).
> If you compare a number with a string or the comparison involves numerical strings, then each string is converted to a number and the comparison performed numerically

> If the string does not contain any of the characters '.', 'e', or 'E' and the numeric value fits into integer type limits (as defined by PHP\_INT\_MAX), the string will be evaluated as an integer. In all other cases it will be evaluated as a float.

For instance, the following comparisons are always TRUE:
> if(0=="php")-> TRUE
> if(12=="12php")-> TRUE
> if(110=="110")-> TRUE
> if(100=="10E1")-> TRUE
> if(array()==NULL) -> TRUE
> [..]

And again, also the following comparisons are TRUE:
> If("0"=="0E19280311"){}
> If("0"=="0E00106552"){}
> If("0"=="0E81046233"){}

Consequently, we can pad and wait till the substring of an md5 hash resembles this form. If you do the math, you will discover that the combined probability of having such calculated hash is considerably less than pure bruteforcing.
> ~37037037 max trials (worth case) VS 3656158440062976 all possibilities

In practice, the number of iterations is even less as "0000E13131" and similar strings are also accepted.

To further improve this attack, I've discovered another bypass (TYPO3-SA-2010-022) which allows the disclosure of TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS['SYS']['encryptionKey']. In this way, it is possible to retrieve the key once and download multiple files without repeating the entire process. Using multiple requests, this attack takes a few minutes (8-20 minutes in a local network). A real coder can surely enhance it.

As you can see from the [exploit](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15856/) (posted on The Exploit Database), the fileDenyPattern mechanism bypass is pretty trivial. A demonstration video is also available [here](http://www.ikkisoft.com/stuff/TYPO3-SA-2010-020_video.htm) (slow connection, sorry).

Keep your TYPO3 installation updated! A patch is already available from the [vendor's site](http://typo3.org/download/).

Hello,

Very nice summary. The weak typing of php is very comfortable from a developers point of view.

But this example illustrates undoubtfully, that without strong input validation small mistakes may lead to serious security vulnerabilities.

Regards,

Marc

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 * Exploit Title: TYPO3 Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Retrieval (TYPO3-SA-2010-020, TYPO3-SA-2010-022)
 * Date: 29/12/2010
 * Author: ikki
 * Software Link: http://typo3.org/download/, http://sourceforge.net/projects/typo3/files/
 * Version: 4.2.15, 4.3.7 or 4.4.4
 * Tested on: php
 * CVE : CVE-2010-3714 (non-typesafe comparison flaw), n/a (fileDenyPattern bypass)
 * A demonstration video for this vulnerability is also available here: http://www.ikkisoft.com/stuff/TYPO3-SA-2010-020_video.htm
 *
 * @_ikki
 *
 * TYPO3 Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Retrieval (TYPO3-SA-2010-020, plus TYPO3-SA-2010-022)
 *
 * Exploiting a non-typesafe comparison flaw, a remote aggressor can access arbitrary files
 * on a vulnerable system. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
 * Moreover, a "fileDenyPattern" bypass has been implemented in order to speed up the attack.
 *

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
