    "CVE-2010-5099": {
      "Description": "Because of insufficient validation of user input it is possible to circumvent the check for executable php files in some cases.",
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of user input in the jumpUrl mechanism.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Non-typesafe comparison between user-supplied hash and calculated hash.",
         "fileDenyPattern bypass"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary file retrieval and potential code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "By crafting a special URL with a manipulated 'jumpurl' parameter and a hash that bypasses the loose comparison, attackers can retrieve arbitrary files.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance."
