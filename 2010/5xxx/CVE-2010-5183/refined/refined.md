{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how antivirus software uses System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks to monitor system calls. The AV software checks a benign code sample, but the code is then switched out with a malicious payload before execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition during code execution",
      "Reliance on SSDT hooks for security checks",
      "Inability of one thread to track changes made by other simultaneously running threads in multi-core processors."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows malicious code to execute undetected, bypassing the security measures of the affected antivirus software. This can lead to malware installation, privilege escalation, and the disabling of antivirus software. The technique could be used in conjunction with other exploits.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Executing a binary on the target machine.",
      "Exploiting a race condition during system calls.",
       "Using a benign code sample to initially pass AV checks which is then swapped out with malicious code before execution."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to run a binary on the target system. This might involve exploiting another vulnerability (e.g., in Adobe Reader or Java Virtual Machine) to gain initial access."
