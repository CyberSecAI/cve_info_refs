  "CVE-2010-5150": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way anti-virus (AV) software uses System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) hooks or similar kernel-mode hooks to modify the operating system kernel. The vulnerability stems from a race condition where a benign code sample is initially checked and passed by AV software, but then gets swapped out with malicious code before execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race condition in AV software's handling of kernel hooks",
         "Inadequate tracking of simultaneously running threads in multi-core processors",
         "Reliance on SSDT hooks for security measures"
       ],
      "impact": "The primary impact is the ability to bypass a wide range of AV protections, allowing malicious code to execute undetected. This can lead to malware installation, removal of AV software, and potential unauthorized access.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploiting the AV software's driver hooks deep within the Windows OS",
        "Timing-based swap of benign code with malicious payload just before execution"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to execute a binary on the target machine. This could be achieved through a secondary exploit such as a vulnerability in Adobe Reader or Java VM."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The 'argument-switch' attack is effective on systems using multi-core processors and can bypass AV protections even on accounts with limited privileges. While it requires loading a large amount of code, making it less suitable for shellcode-based attacks, it can be combined with other software exploits for a successful attack chain. The attack was tested against 34 different AV products, with 100% of them found vulnerable. The attack can also be used to kill an installed and running AV, even on non-admin accounts, which is not normally possible."
