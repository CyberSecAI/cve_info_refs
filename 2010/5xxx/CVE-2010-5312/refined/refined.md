{
  "CVE-2010-5312": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the jQuery UI library, specifically in the jQuery.ui.dialog title option. The title option does not properly escape user-provided input before being set in the DOM, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is improper sanitization/escaping of user-supplied data used in the jQuery UI dialog title option before rendering it to the DOM.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XSS",
      "Insufficient data sanitization",
       "Improper output encoding"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts, leading to potential website defacement, information theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves providing malicious code as the title option to jQuery UI dialog. It can be done by directly crafting the options parameter when initiating the dialog or by indirect means (e.g. if the title content comes from other sources controlled by the attacker).",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to influence the `title` parameter value of the jQuery UI dialog component."
