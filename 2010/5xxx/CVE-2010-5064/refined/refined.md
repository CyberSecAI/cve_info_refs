The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in VWar 1.6.1 R2, a PHP clan management system. Here's a breakdown of each vulnerability:

**1. SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `article.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection in the article rating system. The `ratearticleselect` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query within the `UPDATE` statement.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can deface articles, cause denial of service, and perform other SQL injection related actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `article.php` with a malicious `ratearticleselect` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.

**2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Several input fields in `challenge.php`, `joinus.php`, `admin/admin.php`, and `profile.php` do not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database, and these inputs are rendered as part of HTML pages later. Although `<script>` tags are filtered, `<img>` tags with `onload` or `onerror` events are not, allowing Javascript execution.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users, leading to session hijacking and potentially gaining administrator access.
*   **Attack Vector:** Submitting malicious HTML (e.g., `<IMG src='' onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`) in the vulnerable input fields.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to input data into the specified forms, which may require basic user access.

**3. Broken Access Controls**

*   **Root Cause:** The `popup.php` script, used for print views, lacks proper access control. It allows access to restricted articles via the `printnews` action without requiring user authentication.
*  **Vulnerabilities:** Inadequate access control leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized users can view member-only content.
*   **Attack Vector:** Directly accessing `popup.php` with a crafted `newsid` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.

**4. Weak Password Generation**

*   **Root Cause:** The `createRandomPassword` function in `functions_common.php` uses `mt_srand` seeded with the current seconds, leading to a limited set of predictable passwords.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**  Weak password generation, predictable passwords.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can easily brute-force passwords for existing users due to the limited number of possible passwords. The lack of account lockout mechanisms further exacerbates this.
*   **Attack Vector:** Automated brute-forcing of user accounts using a dictionary of likely generated passwords.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login form.

**5. Static Session Cookies**

*   **Root Cause:** Session cookies are generated by hashing the user's password (which is also hashed using MD5). This results in the same session cookie every time a user logs in.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Static session cookies.
*   **Impact:** If an attacker obtains a user's session cookie, session timeouts and logout functions become ineffective as the attacker can use the static cookie to maintain access indefinitely.
*   **Attack Vector:** Stealing a user's session cookie (e.g., through an XSS attack).
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to gain access to a user's session cookie, potentially through previously identified XSS vulnerabilities.
