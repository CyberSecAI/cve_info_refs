The provided content relates to CVE-2025-22376.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of a weak source of randomness for generating the nonce in the `Net::OAuth::Client` module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Randomness:** The module used `rand()` function to generate nonce, which is a weak source of randomness and can lead to predictability issues.
- **Nonce Predictability:** Predictable nonces can potentially allow an attacker to bypass the OAuth signature verification and conduct attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially forge OAuth requests or replay existing requests, leading to unauthorized access to protected resources or impersonation of legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating or predicting the nonce value during the OAuth handshake process. This would likely involve intercepting and analyzing legitimate requests to determine the pattern used to generate the nonce.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to observe the OAuth communication between a client and the service provider.
- The attacker needs the ability to forge or replay OAuth requests.
