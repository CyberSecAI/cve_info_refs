{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A debugging feature in the SSH integration functionality was unintentionally left enabled in production releases.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Input and output data from SSH sessions was logged to a file on the remote host, with world readable permissions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The exposure of sensitive information in /tmp/framer.txt, including potentially passwords or other confidential data. This could lead to unauthorized access to the compromised remote host.",
  "Attack vectors": "Successful exploitation requires usage of the it2ssh command or having SSH Integration enabled in iTerm2 settings in combination with a remote host having Python 3.7 or later installed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need access to the affected remote host with the ability to read the /tmp directory and the knowledge that such a file might exist."
