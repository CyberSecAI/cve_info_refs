Version 3.5.11 of iTerm2 was built on January 2, 2025.
This release contains a critical security fix. I
strongly recommend updating immediately.
Who is affected?
----------------
You may be affected if you used the SSH
integration feature in any of the following
versions:
\* 3.5.6
\* 3.5.7
\* 3.5.8
\* 3.5.9
\* 3.5.10
\* Any beta versions of 3.5.6 and later.
What is the issue?
------------------
A bug in the SSH integration feature caused input
and output to be logged to a file on the remote
host. This file, /tmp/framer.txt, may be readable
by other users on the remote host.
When does this occur?
---------------------
The issue occurs if both of the following conditions are true:
1. Either:
a) You used the it2ssh command, or
b) In Settings > Profiles > General, the
Command popup menu was set to "SSH" (not
"Login Shell", "Command", or "Custom
Command") AND "SSH Integration" was checked
in the SSH configuration dialog. That dialog
is shown when you click the Configure button
next to the ssh arguments field in Settings.
2. The remote host has Python 3.7 or later
installed in its default search path.
What should you do?
-------------------
\* Upgrade immediately to version 3.5.11.
\* Delete /tmp/framer.txt on affected hosts.
How I'm addressing this
-----------------------
I deeply regret this mistake and will take steps
to ensure it never happens again.
The code to write to log files in SSH integration
has been deleted and will not be publicly released
again.

If they don't apologize, that'd be worse. If they don't indicate they'll take steps to prevent this from happening in the future, that'd be worse. If they had all the steps ready right now, I'd be confused because they should have A) fixed the bug B) deployed the fix C) communicated the bug exists and a fix was deployed. Blending that with D) postmortem would show an undisciplined approach. If they claimed the ability to prevent all bugs ever, or at least, all unintentional file writes, I'd be confused because it's impossible to *prove* it never writes to a file. A good start is to do what he did (delete the ssh logging altogether), and start investigating automated ways to validate if/when files are accessed. The cool thing about macOS dev is there's a ton of tooling that leaps and bounds beyond cross-ecosystem tooling. I wouldn't be very surprised if someone linked an obscure mid-1990s technical note that lets you set an NSArray of paths that are allowed access, or if Instruments had some built-in dtrace integration that could pull this off. Couple running that in CI, make sure you got test coverage, and you've done the best you can. (n.b. a lot of it seems to hinge on "I deeply regret this mistake and will take steps to ensure it never happens again." being read as "I deeply regret this mistake.

Two more: 2) if you accidentally close a tab/window, you have a few seconds to hit ⌘z and the window will reappear as if you never closed it! 3) Minimum color contrast. If your terminal color scheme and what you're running's color scheme interact poorly to create something that would be unreadable, iterm *notices* and you can have it override those colors to be something of higher contrast, automatically. But that's just *my* killer features. iTerm is like Word - it is a bloated monster with thousands of features. Nobody needs them all, but nobody agrees on which ones they need.

I want an actual-full-screen, with menu-bar and Dock invisible, with no window chrome - not merely “fill the maximum allowable space by the OS, as if dragging the windows corner with mouse”. BUT I don’t want to use the native affordance for that, since that makes it its own “Desktop”, and I can no longer switch to it using my Snow Leopard-era muscle memory of using ^-<number> to switch between them. I am fully aware that this is incredibly niche requirement, but it is a dealbreaker for me :) I saw that Ghostty kinda supports this; but then disables tab support if this is enabled, which, also an obvious dealbreaker.

I am also also deeply concerned about my use of iTerm now. I access HPC environments where I may have access for a short period of time. I am expected to take responsibility to clear out my data after use and don't expect there to be any data leakage. If I had been manipulating PII research data in the past year and using iTerm's SSH integration I would be in a bit of a bind and have to send some really embarrassing emails asking sysadmins to see if these logs exist, and if they belong to me, followed by disclosing data had been leaked. I use some of the more advanced features but at this point wonder if I should be using any features beyond the basic, and then I may as well be using another terminal.

If you, personally, have to vet the whole system and all the software you use for security, then they have none. A competent system administrator with a knowledge of system security can easily configure a host so that when you SSH in, files you create are not given world-readable permissions by default. They can add other lock-down mechanisms that isolates all the users' files entirely. And they can simply disable all world-writeable folders like /tmp/. So in case anyone gives you (or anyone else) a load of crap about using insecure software, ask them why their systems are so insecure.

[1]: <https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/issues/8491> [2]: [https://github.com/search?q=NoSyncSearchHistory+path%3A\*.pli...](https://github.com/search?q=NoSyncSearchHistory+path%3A*.plist&type=code)   [reply](reply?id=42581790&goto=item%3Fid%3D42579472%2342581790) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [johnsonalpha](user?id=johnsonalpha) [11 days ago](item?id=42582095)   | [prev](#42581790) | [next](#42579595) [–]  I’m a bit confused by the suggestion to "Just don’t use iTerm2." The reality is that this type of issue could happen with any project, and switching tools doesn’t provide meaningful protection. If anything, incidents like this often lead to stronger security practices. It’s like the old joke about firing an engineer after a mistake, and the manager responding, "Why would I fire them? They’ve just learned a lesson they won’t forget." Based on iTerm2’s track record, it doesn’t seem like they’ve had frequent critical security issues, and I doubt they’ll repeat this mistake. If they do, then it’s fair to reassess. As for the MacOS Terminal app, it might seem like a lower-risk option because it’s simpler and updates less frequently. However, being closed-source makes it impossible to audit, which brings its own risks. Ultimately, every tool has tradeoffs, and choosing the right one depends on balancing your needs with the potential risks.

Second, do you believe that past track record is reflective of that security bug rate? These are two reasonable beliefs that many people hold.

(I suppose I talk about this enough that it might be worth compiling all the history I’m aware of somewhere, I don’t want to sound like I’m just making this up) It’s also notable that iTerm was found vulnerable to the same bug discovered recently in Ghostty: [https://threatintelligencelab.com/blog/cve-2024-38396-a-crit...](https://threatintelligencelab.com/blog/cve-2024-38396-a-critical-vulnerability-in-iterm2/) > I also don't understand the general animosity towards an opensource project with one developer doing all the work for 15 years I have nothing against George Nachman and iTerm2 is certainly an achievement, one that I probably couldn’t replicate myself. Nonetheless I feel the need to hold my terminal emulator to higher standards because it processes sensitive data and untrusted input with (inherently) poor isolation between the two. Until Ghostty I used Terminal.app for many years, having previously switched away from iTerm2 after the vulnerability discovered in 2017. That’s still what I recommend to people because it has a much smaller feature set and thus attack surface compared to iTerm.

I don´t get an update for iTerm2 every week so I figured it was mostly stable / had no sec issue. Following this discussion I decided to give Ghostty and kitty a try. I kept Ghostty, mainly because the shortcuts I use the most in iTerm2 are there and I like the default theme (yes, I'm a simple person.) It has less features / integrations I don´t use anyway so I guess the attack surface is smaller.

In my mind this is one of the clearest violations of privacy and information security I've been directly subjected to, because the developer had some gee-whiz-neato idea of highlighting URLs in a terminal and making them clickable.

If you want to make that your position (I am sure it is already, and I don't think it is particularly controversial) that is completely fine. But there's a difference between holding that and your actual comment. Like, this was 100% unintentional, and people literally introduce malicious or undesirable features in their software all the time. Maybe we should save the tarring and feathering for that, and come up with a more measured take for stuff like this?

We have no idea what your average terminal activity involves. (I can't remember why I switched. It must have been 10 years ago now, maybe more, and I've stuck with iTerm2 ever since (even though it annoys me with a new beta update practically every time I launch it). It could have been nothing fancier than the vertical window split. But there was definitely something that persuaded me to change!) EDIT: this did get me wondering, and I noticed two things it does have that it looks like Terminal still doesn't: configurable mouse selection word boundary chars, and implicit copy-to-clipboard on selection. As an inveterate mouse selector, I wonder if it was these. I might well actually have the word boundary chars still set to the default ("/-+\~\_." is what I've got), but I do use the click-to-copy a lot.

From what I understand, the issue is that literally all of stdin and stdout is potentially leaked to a globally-readable text file. ssh-keys wouldn't normally be part that leaked information (other than if you `cat` your private key, but by that logic, literally any credentials ever stored in a file or potentially even an env var would be equally susceptible). Yes, anyone with ssh access would have access, but nothing about this vulnerability seems to imply it would allow an unauthorized user to gain ssh access. It doesn't sound like this is something with a specific risk of leveraging into ssh access because the only ones who can read the file are the ones with access in the first place, so there's no more reason to suspect that now compared to any other point in time.

I believe this means just means that the entire contents of your ssh session is available in /tmp/framer.txt. But as long as credentials aren't part of your STDIN/STDOUT, then they shouldn't be leaked. Your ssh private key definitely would never be in there. The server you're connecting to doesn't even know your private key, just the public one.

It's possible that anything getting read in via "silent mode" (see `-s` in <https://ss64.com/bash/read.html>) might not get put into that file, but given that this was a bug rather than a feature, it would probably be better to check the source code (or try an example with an unpatched version) to be sure.

The same class of issue can occur for any other project, and switching is not a very effective defense against it. If anything, having an embarrassing issue like this is probably going to improve the iTerm2 project's security posture in the medium term. It's like that joke about firing the engineer who caused the incident, and the manager who retorts, "Why would I fire them? They just learned the hard way never to make this mistake again." (I'm paraphrasing.) I don't think that iTerm2 has had a notably high rate of critical security issues, and I suspect they won't make this class of mistake twice. (And if they do - then I will re-evaluate.) I suppose intuitively I would think that using the default MacOS Terminal app is a bit lower-risk than using iTerm2 or any other open source terminal emulator, as Terminal is a rather sparse piece of Apple-provided software with a low pace of change. But it's also closed source and impossible to audit, so there are tradeoffs there too.

Try to dig through the preferences, there's surprisingly much choice for an opinionated software vendor like Apple. I love it, I've tried iTerm2 in the past but I just saw no reason to keep using it. The only feature that slightly appealed to me was the tmux integration but I found that i preferred to just have tmux inside the terminal instead. I know some people that use the game-like rolldown interface (quake mode?) but I also don't like/need that one. There's a few niche things like that which make it interesting. But overall I just don't see the need. If there's something that's sparse in options, it's Windows Terminal. Don't like that one at all (though it's better than the previous command prompt window).

Pretty standard security principle. Ssh integration brings lots of other "local" iterm features based on command history, etc. to the ssh environment. If you do lots of ssh work and use a lot of relevant iterm features then it's nice. Otherwise not. Obviously, these features can be recreated with traditional tools. But these tools take time and experience to setup, and aren't naturally intuitive, despite the insistence of emacs elitists. For those who don't want to invest significant effort learning tmux, it's really nice to just check/uncheck a few boxes.

I'm more than certain that George Nachman is a great developer developing great software, and I am not saying otherwise. I will however not cede that I do not wish to use iTerm2 because of the existence of the dns lookup bug in the first place, combined with the high input latency - I will not use software just because someone has put a lot of effort in it - I have to feel good about using it too :)  [reply](reply?id=42589279&goto=item%3Fid%3D42579472%2342589279) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [likeabatterycar](user?id=likeabatterycar) [11 days ago](item?id=42585637)   | [root](#42581034) | [parent](#42585095) | [prev](#42585722) | [next](#42583483) [–]  People are allowed to have preferences and dislike software.

And I haven’t even mentioned that the game is running via Crossover through multiple translation systems. That’s translating both Intel Windows to ARM Mac as well as translating the graphics APIs (DirectX or Vulkan to Metal). The cyberpunk native Mac release comes out this year and will almost certainly improve performance further. Why would anyone care about ultra settings on a laptop? I don’t even set my PC desktop to ultra settings in the game and I have a current generation mid-high end GPU. Setting demanding games to Ultra just giving up FPS to not tell the difference. 30fps 1080p is basically console-level standards for a AAA graphically intense game (not esports or online shooter). And that isn’t bad at all for the processor with integrated graphics that Apple sticks in its cheapest computer and its tablets. Your MacBook Pro M4 Pro is one of the best gaming laptops on the market in terms of hardware! Especially if you want something that’s thin, light, and quiet with good battery life and not just a thick tank of a system or a loud but thin and light gaming laptop that struggles to power and cool its dGPU. Depending on your configuration, you can actually play Cyberpunk at high settings at or above 60FPS on your laptop. You’re vastly underestimating it! Your laptop just needs the software to get ported, and the Mac gaming space is rapidly evolving now that Apple is paying attention to it.

Also, latency is an issue, and of the third-party terminals, only kitty is snappy enough to have nearly zero latency issues while typing. Drives me crazy when I’m chaining commands and there is a ~150ms delay. Plus, any terminal other than kitty is noticeably laggy when using other terminal programs and typing quickly, and 90%+ of my time is spent in the terminal: using custom commands and aliases, ruby shell, docker, on top of usually using vim for editing. And having great customizable hotkeys for different common functions.

I have a souped-up zsh config that I clone to all my systems, but I've honestly never seen the point in optimizing my terminal emulator.

(You can actually kinda do this in Terminal.app as well by right-clicking a URL and choosing to open it, but it's a bit fiddlier, and I got used to the hover feedback in iTerm2.) You can click to highlight entire blocks of output from commands, which I sometimes find handy when things feel like they're blending together. It'll keep a floating copy of the previous command prompt at the top of the screen so you can see what led to whatever output is currently at the top. None of these are essential, for sure.

The shells within Emacs have unlimited and easily searchable/editable state. I can log into a shell buffer and copy paste a debug diagnostic output together with the command line; I can quickly create minimal example oneliners iteratively to help debug a problem and paste both input and output at any point in time, including days later. I can search all my open shells (often dozens; sometimes hundreds) for any commands or outputs trivially. This is hard to achieve if the terminal gets in the way to using Emacs in the way I like, when some key combo is impossible to transmit, and I have to rewire things to the minimal common subset that Terminal.app supports and hope that it will not break in the future. Finally, without public source code, I dont think I can truly trust a terminal ever. It feels too personal. Of course apple has control of the hardware and I live with that restriction for parts of my life, but I am less concerned about apple monitoring/intercepting my work, and rather worried about the full number of exploits in the terminal app that remain to be uncovered in the near term. I agree that too many features are a drawback of iterm; at least the code is there and the useful features work well enough.

Let’s not forget that basically every graphical IDE on the planet has an integrated terminal emulator, and for good reason I’d have a smaller attack surface if I turned my computer off and did all my work for my employer with pen and paper. I’d have a smaller attack surface if I didn’t buy a Mac at all and only used a security-hardened distro. And here you are acting like Apple is God’s gift to stability and security when every single fall season Apple’s major dot zero version updates ship with visible bugs all over the place. And to nitpick you, the assumption that more than one person is actively working on the default macOS terminal is laughable.

Am I missing something, because there are so many activists like you having an inexplicable vendetta against iTerm2 all over this thread. This is sad because iTerm2 is one of the best terminal emulators out there. It's the first terminal emulator that popularized shell integration. Newer terminal emulators are still catching up, a decade later. tmux integration is another popular feature that's still unique to iTerm2. George has been working tirelessly on iTerm2 pretty much solo for 15 years [1]. To this day, he continuously brings new improvements to the terminal experience that keeps being copied by other terminal emulators. Developers benefit from his work, iTerm2 users and non-users alike. We should be expressing our gratitude instead of doing whatever people are doing in this thread. George found this security issue the day after New Year's day and immediately released a fix [2]. That's commitment. And while the effects of this bug can be severe, most people wouldn't have triggered the bug. ```     > 1. Either:     >   a) You used the it2ssh command, or     >   b) In Settings > Profiles > General, the     >      Command popup menu was set to "SSH" (not     >      "Login Shell", "Command", or "Custom     >      Command") AND "SSH Integration" was checked     >      in the SSH configuration dialog. That dialog     >      is shown when you click the Configure button     >      next to the ssh arguments field in Settings.  ``` It's almost as if some people are jumping at any chance of retribution, justified or not. This all sure intensified after iTerm2 at one point introduced an AI-related feature into the default build that one can just safely forget exists by not actively enabling and engaging with it. Some in the Mastodon community even went as far as openly fantasizing about inflicting violence on the poor dev [3]. I just can't understand the morality of some of the people you see online.

I don't understand the animus either. I just sent a $ donation to the maintainer. The response to this bug is completely over the top. He found a security issue in an optional feature, immediately fixed it over the New Year holiday, and provided clear documentation about who was affected and how to address it. That's exactly how responsible disclosure should work. The level of hostility - especially over adding optional features that people can simply choose not to use - suggests this is more about bandwagoning than legitimate criticism. We should be supporting developers who maintain critical open source infrastructure, not attacking them over a prompt response to a contained issue.

All I highlighted is the flaw in the argument that a mistake made is a lesson learned. Indeed, there’s no indication the root cause of the lesson leading to this situation has indeed been learned. You seem to be triggered by a perceived critical comment of a piece of software you’ve developed an emotional attachment to. I have not attacked anyone associated with the iterm2 project nor have I questioned his talent in creating a popular project or his commitment to it.

I can assure you that's incredibly condescending. It's uncalled for too. iTerm2 has a good track record responding to user issues, even obscure ones involving Japanese input. The dev even listened to the demands of trolls who raided the issue tracker from Mastodon [1]. Security fixes are released quickly. Nothing about the project warrants the kind of cheap dismissal in display all over this thread. You mentioned emotional attachment twice in this thread as reason some people have problems with dismissive, aggressive, or mean comments against iTerm2. No, it's basic empathy and appreciation for the thankless work going into this FOSS project.

I don’t use iterm2 nor is it a piece of software that takes up any mindspace for me but attacking this aggressively anyone even mildly critical because you feel like you’re part of this minority group and you need to defend yourself because you feel constantly attacked is tribalism, not empathy and appreciation.

Plenty of people on here are having a rational discussion about how this happened and several people recommended tips such as commit hooks to prevent WIP work from getting committed and released. That would be an example of a lesson learned. Indeed, it's entirely possible that George has learned that lesson too. I was just literally describing the logical problem with the assumed logic of "mistake made = lesson learned", especially when there's no evidence outlining what the lesson learned was. Similarly plenty of comments in response to things I've said have been fairly well balanced. As for the backlash, I just highlighted how 2 responses in particular seemed emotionally charged and border line attacked me for completely innocuous comments. The first was completely condescending and sarcastic while adding no additional value to the conversation on a completely unrelated comment thread where I suggested that maybe, just maybe, the terminal you choose isn't going to meaningfully improve your productivity. Your conversation has accused me of being in league with people threatening violence to the iTerm2 author and again adding nothing to the discussion about what lessons were actually learned and then attacking me and demeaning me in all sorts of ways and accusing me of saying things I simply have not. How would you describe that? A logical defense of someone I'm not attacking?

Again, I was very specifically responding to the claim at the beginning of the thread that a mistake made is a lesson learned isn’t actually true just because a mistake is made. It’s a very basic logical fallacy made by OP. And I point out how while he says he learned something he doesn’t actually clarify what the lesson is and what steps he’s taking to prevent said mistakes in the future. You may disagree but I feel like that adds something to the discussion.

The resolved the issue by ripping out the feature. However, the latter issue remains unaddressed and to me is equally if not more concerning - there should be good practices in place to ensure that feature flags aren't even being controlled via code edits and instead there's .gitignor'ed config files that are read in a developer build for turning those features on. Additionally, git commit hooks that scan for WIP comments & prevent pushing them and sprinkling WIP comments around temporary changes might also be good defense in depth measures.

That’s not actually a postmortem of a list of process changes. Nothing about how WIP changes made it through into a code release nor in how such mistakes will be prevented in the future. There’s a much richer discussion of options in this thread of things people do to prevent things like this.

Security vulnerabilities like this can cause actual harm, so it's understandable that people see someone fail to live up to the responsibility and they get mad. There aren't easy solutions to having responsibility. All you can do is live up to it, which sometimes means you need to apply rigor and processes that make hacking less fun, or that you need to make compromises you don't like. "to think other projects couldn't have issues is just naive" is the wrong way to look at it. You should evaluate the processes that lead to the binary (or source tarball) that you're running on your machine. Is every commit/PR being reviewed by someone other than the author? By *multiple* someones, ideally? Do they run automated test suites before shipping?

In this case, the person is a solo developer, so who exactly should be reviewing the PRs? I trust this developer because they have a long history of delivering quality software, with quick turnaround on bugs in general, and even faster on security related bugs like this one. His "responsibility" is to maintain the trust that he will develop to the best of his ability and will react quickly to issues. The so-called "rigor and processes" in current SW engineering are nonsense and busy work. Not once in my 40 years of SW development has a code review revealed a major bug that wasn't some sort of developer brain fart. Maybe the actual security issue here is that a) /tmp is world read/writeable on many Unix/Linux VMs/machines, and b) you should lock down your SSH connections so that they don't have access to it. Stop blaming the other person's software and look at your own security "rigor and processes".

If I understand the security vulnerability correctly here, what happened is a well-meaning and skilled engineer accidentally checked in debugging code and shipped it in multiple releases. This shouldn't happen if people are reviewing your PRs and if you're being cautious about what you ship. If nobody else is reviewing the iTerm2 code that means the developer isn't getting the support he needs from the community, which is a shame. The general tone of your comment is confusing though since it seems you're suggesting the solution to iTerm2 shipping a major security vulnerability is to just assume every piece of software is broken, instead of come up with ways to develop and ship more secure software. Are you really comfortable with every part of the software stack you use - firmware, OS kernel, libc, userspace - meeting this non-standard and being full of holes? Do you want to spend hours every day chasing down the latest vulnerability report? If your experience with code review is that it never catches anything, either you're the greatest programmer in human history who never makes mistakes, or the people doing your code reviews aren't trying. I participate in open source code reviews on a daily basis against multiple repositories and we catch bugs/oversights in each others' work all the time.

There's no incentive for someone to do a proper code review, because finding a bug isn't rewarded in any way by either the reviewer or the developer. Most of the "bugs" found are either things that a good linter will pick up (variable naming, etc) or are minor. Code reviews of peer's code in an open source project is very different because the incentives are there to promote transparency and visibility and there is a negative incentive for delivering code that doesn't pass review (general reputation, removal of committal rights etc). The solution to iTerm2 shipping a major (it wasn't) security vulnerability is that when it is discovered, a new release with a fix is quickly released, the effects of the defect are clearly described and the mechanism for rectification is made clear. iTerm2 did that, clearly and transparently. The solution for developing and shipping more secure software is to remove options for things like world readable temporary files. The operating system should remove the capability such that you have to specifically *enable* it, which requires a conscious decision to do so. Apple's SIP has removed a large number of opportunities for bugs, more could be done to fully sandbox user processes. Making it *impossible* for a certain class of bugs to occur is a much better approach than code review attempting to find the problem after development.

Now you probably shouldn't have such a security gap easily enabled by verbose flag in the first place but that's a parallel issue. The author of his own hobby project is of course free to do whatever he wants without review and nobody can blame him for it. But anyone claiming code review doesn't find bugs has obviously never used them in a functional setting or only worked in small teams with only 10x developers. I estimate we find *at least* 1 bug per day in our code review process, even after tests and lint. On top of that there is also benefits by knowledge sharing of what's being changed and general improvement suggestions.

What would such a test look like, "test that no file in /tmp was touched"? That can only be done after you know such issue might exist, which is great to prevent regressions, but doesn't help to stop new unknown bugs. What else are you going to test for, no files in /foo were touched, no files in /bar and so on to infinity? "No files at all were touched", sure could be reasonable, but again keeps growing to an infinite set of "X must not happen", including other forms of IO like connections and API calls. Most security issues have this property, you can't test if a system is free of injection vulnerabilities, without exhausting every possible input combination or using advanced fuzzing techniques.

In this case to avoid the bug, every ssh server in the world would need a per-user tmpfs. Ideally, that would indeed be neat, short term it's not realistic. For the iterm2 case of a ssh client, an admin may also need to inspect the actual /tmp when debugging the server and then need to bypass the sandbox. A sandbox will never have the perfect granularity for every scenario. So we can't just throw our hands in the air and say "not my problem", alternative forms of verification are needed. Besides, how do you *test* or *review* your sandbox and its configuration? Both are still needed. Incidentally, k8s works a bit like this with no default shared tmpfs across containers. So such large scale production deployments are more protected against this type of issue. On the other hand, for debugging, as you would with ssh, it hardly has a concept of users at all, and lots of other ways to shoot yourself in the foot with :)   [reply](reply?id=42595598&goto=item%3Fid%3D42579472%2342595598) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [watermelon0](user?id=watermelon0) [11 days ago](item?id=42583471)   | [root](#42583082) | [parent](#42583331) | [prev](#42583409) | [next](#42583708) [–]  > when you build this kind of software you have a certain responsibility to be thoughtful and cautious and not indirectly cause harm to others I think the only responsibility maintainers of an open source project have is to not intentionally cause harm, and even that might not be absolute (e.g. would it really be that wrong for maintainer(s) to remove a package/source code, if they so decide, like with the left-pad debacle). > Is every commit/PR being reviewed by someone other than the author?

I understand this perspective as a developer but it feels kind of like a feel-good don't-worry-just-have-fun thing. Don't worry, just have fun is how we get big security breaches that cause measurable harm on real people. It's fine to not worry and have fun if you're hacking on something that isn't a part of critical workflows or managing sensitive data, but a terminal is not that! The moment your app is asking a user to type in a password, you have a responsibility for what happens with what they type in! It's not *only your* responsibility but you simply have to be aware of the long term consequences of every action you take as a software developer, whether it's choosing not to bounds-check a memcpy call or choosing to add a dangerous verbose logging facility. The bill for our decisions always comes due eventually and the question is who's paying the bill. In this case, the end users are paying for it. > There is a good chance that they would welcome additional maintainers, so you can try volunteering to do that. I don't have a mac, but if I used iTerm2 I'd certainly be contributing to the author's patreon. It doesn't seem like many people are even doing that much, let alone reviewing commits.

There's a spectrum of risk depending on the kind of software you're writing and the approach you take to writing it. One end of the spectrum is viruses, software designed to be malicious that the author absolutely should bear responsibility for the consequences of. Another end is toy software created for fun shared with a few friends that doesn't do anything important. On that end of the spectrum you're all having a good time and as long as you don't do something stupid like delete system files with a buggy I/O routine, there's probably not much to worry about. But surely you understand how iTerm2 is not toy software, right? It's essential infrastructure, and the security impact of this bug is large specifically because it's important software. Important software needs to be developed with caution because if you screw up people can lose their files *or worse*. This isn't a moral judgment or something I *want* to be true, it *is* true. If people don't like the responsibility that comes with developing essential infrastructure *they shouldn't develop essential infrastructure*, and as user/developer communities we should support the developers of essential infrastructure instead of pretending that rigor and quality are unimportant.

This was a great terminal when it was basically Terminal.app + missing features but over the past years it has grown into the proveribal "Kitchen Sink" and now does SO MANY things that I just don't care about. iTerm2 has become a huge app with many many knobs and levers and all kinds of functionality and integrations. I am not surprised at all that (security) bugs are found. More code, features, integrations means more potential for security issues. I switched to Ghostty, yes which had a security issue last week!, but at least it is a pretty minimal app with so far no intent to meet iTerm2 in terms of functionality.

The integration of iTerm2 with Fish was so buggy that I needed to disable, then I lost some features like imgcat... These bugs persisted while they were introducing AI features that I really don't care (it's a terminal, why would we need AI???). I think it's time for me to move on... I don't need too much, just something that works as good as Konsole does on Linux distros. The comments here (yours included) made me consider using Ghostty.

Many terminal programs, especially older ones, are known for having confusing or unintuitive interfaces, especially if you use them sparingly and you need to do something specific that can't immediately be gleaned from search results or from the man page. I've personally found Claude to be tremendously helpful for these cases; I am now much more confident in my use of ffmpeg, as Claude can often zero-shot the invocation for my particular need, or give me the opportunity to follow up and narrow the details of the problem. Given that, I'd happily welcome the iTerm2 integration, which I'm led to believe was optional, as I could readily specify the behaviour / action I want in natural language and have the AI produce the correct invocation without having to leave the terminal. This could also be addressed through a CLI application to invoke a LLM (i.e. simonw's `llm`), but that's not as convenient as having the terminal itself insert the LLM's response for evaluation and execution.

When there is such a rich database of manual pages and q/a about these tools, I tend to blame the user rather than the tool when I hear it called "too complex". Additionally, if you don't understand what the command is doing why are you about to execute it in your terminal?

Strong disagree. The example they gave about ffmpeg is a great example. Let's say I'm a casual ffmpeg user that wants to wrangle some videos one way or another. I don't have the time to dig through ffmpeg's manual with tons of different options and terms that I don't understand just to figure out, as a trivial example, how to convert an mp4 to an mp3 while maintaining the best quality possible. I have 0 interest in learning about media formats, codecs, etc. I just want the result. This is not unreasonable. With ChatGPT/Claude/etc, this is an even more trivial task. Nothing wrong with that. I'm willing to take the (minimal) risk of running an ffmpeg command while taking a common sense glance at it. It won't destroy my existing file. Or I'll run it on a copy if I'm being paranoid. I'm not dumb enough to destroy my machine or get some malware by running an unfamiliar ffmpeg command I copy pasted. My #1 usage for LLMs is bash/zsh commands. Shell syntax is miserable to say the least.

Extensive documentation doesn't mean the interface is *good*. `tar` is probably one of the most documented commands of all time, but that hasn't stopped it from being the subject of an XKCD [0]. > Additionally, if you don't understand what the command is doing why are you about to execute it in your terminal? I can look up what the LLM's generated, or assess it from looking at it. (Comprehension is not the same as production.) In general, I can work without it, but I'm a lot happier with it: when I need to encode a video to x264 with an acceptable bitrate while burning in the embedded subtitles, downmixing to two audio channels, and boosting audio by 20%, I can just ask that, instead of looking at 7 SO/SE/man/wiki/random blog post tabs and synthesizing it myself. I *can* do that. It's not a good use of my time.
