Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `search_num.php` file of the "pos-inventory-system-in-php" application. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `name` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

*   **Weakness:** The application directly incorporates the `$search` parameter into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

*   **Impact:** A malicious attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through the vulnerable parameter, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Bypass authentication
    *   Read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
    *  Potentially gain complete access to the database server.

*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `search_num.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `name` parameter to include malicious SQL code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs to know the endpoint path.

**Technical Details:**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the SQL injection:
* The vulnerable parameter is `name`.
* The PoC utilizes a payload `' or 1=1--` within the `name` parameter to create a SQL injection.
* When the application uses the injected payload, the SQL query always evaluates to true and bypasses the intended search criteria.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerable application is identified as a "pos-inventory-system-in-php" and is available from [https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/](https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/)
*   The file `search_num.php` in the `/user/` directory is the source of the vulnerability.
*   The exploit is shown to work in an environment with a host of 'localhost'.

**Conclusion:**

The provided content clearly describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the identified PHP application, and the PoC demonstrates the ease with which the vulnerability can be exploited.
