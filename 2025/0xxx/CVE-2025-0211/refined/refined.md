Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the insecure inclusion of files within the `admin/index.php` page. The application directly uses user-supplied input from the `$_GET['page']` parameter to include PHP files, without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is Local File Inclusion. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The vulnerable code snippet is `<?php include $page.'.php' ?>`.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the `page` parameter, allowing an attacker to supply malicious file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including files containing PHP code, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, including configuration files, database credentials, and other confidential data using php://filter.
*   **Denial of Service:** By including large or resource-intensive files, an attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a simple HTTP GET request by manipulating the `page` parameter. For example, `GET /scheduling/admin/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **No Authentication Required for LFI:** The provided exploit indicates the LFI is present at `/admin/index.php`, meaning authentication is likely required for admin access, but not for exploiting the LFI vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to use the `php://filter` wrapper to read the content of files in base64 encoding.
