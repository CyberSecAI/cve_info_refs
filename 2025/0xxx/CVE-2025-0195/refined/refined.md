Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2025-0195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `del_product.php` file of the `pos-inventory-system-in-php`. The `id` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the database.
- Unauthorized Data Modification: An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The vulnerability is exploitable via an HTTP POST request to `/POS_inventory/user/del_product.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- Understanding of HTTP Requests: The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
- Basic SQL Knowledge: The attacker needs basic SQL knowledge to construct malicious queries.
