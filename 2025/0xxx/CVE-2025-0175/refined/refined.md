Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization or validation of the `name` and `details` parameters in the `/view.php` file of the online shop application. The application directly echoes user-supplied values from the `$_GET` array without any form of encoding or filtering, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access Sensitive Information:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive client-side information through malicious scripts executed in the user's browser. This might include session cookies, user data, or other private details.
- **Account Hijacking:** By capturing session cookies, attackers can potentially hijack user accounts.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or distribute malware.
- **Phishing:** Attackers can create fake login forms or other elements that trick users into revealing their credentials.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can alter the content and appearance of the vulnerable page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is initiated through a crafted HTTP GET request that includes malicious JavaScript in the `name` or `details` parameters.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker directly manipulates the URL parameters to inject the malicious payload, as shown in the Proof of Concept (PoC).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker must be aware of the existence of the vulnerable parameters (`name` and `details`) in `/view.php`.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious JavaScript or HTML payloads to be injected into the vulnerable page.
