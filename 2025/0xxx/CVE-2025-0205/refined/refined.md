The provided content is related to CVE-2025-0205.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the `details2.php` file of an online shoe store application. Specifically, the `$id` parameter obtained from the GET request is directly inserted into an SQL query without any validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-controlled input (`$id` parameter).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the database.
- Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
- Data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL of `details2.php` to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `details2.php` endpoint.
- No prior authentication is explicitly required.
