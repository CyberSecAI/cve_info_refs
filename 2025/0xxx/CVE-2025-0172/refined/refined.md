Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of the `id` parameter in the `/admin/deleteroom.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code directly into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where untrusted user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries. Specifically a Time-Based Blind SQL Injection is possible.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the `id` parameter received through the `$_POST` array.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to modify or delete data in the database (as the provided code already does).
- **Information Disclosure:** Using time-based SQL injection, an attacker can infer information from the database by causing delays in the response. This can be used to extract sensitive information.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection may serve as a stepping stone for more severe attacks, such as privilege escalation or complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/admin/deleteroom.php`, with a maliciously crafted `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/admin/deleteroom.php` and that the `id` parameter is vulnerable.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is within `/admin/deleteroom.php`:
```php
<?php
	include('../conn.php');

	if (isset($_POST['del'])){
		$id=$_POST['id'];

		mysqli_query($conn,"delete from `chatroom` where chatroomid='$id'");
		mysqli_query($conn,"delete from `chat` where chatroomid='$id'");
		mysqli_query($conn,"delete from `chat_member` where chatroomid='$id'");
	}
?>
```
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using `sleep(5)`:
```
POST /admin/deleteroom.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:7777
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
...
Content-Length: 24
...

id=4' or sleep(5)#&del=1
```
- This injected payload will cause a 5-second delay in the MySQL query execution, multiplied by the 3 `delete` queries being executed. There is also an additional delay from the webserver, leading to a ~30 second total delay, confirming the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability.
