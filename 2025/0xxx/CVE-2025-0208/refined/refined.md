Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of input sanitization of the `$tid` parameter in the `/summary.php` file. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `tid` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can potentially leverage the SQL injection to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could modify, delete, or insert data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attacker manipulates the `tid` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL code through an HTTP GET request to `/summary.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication.
- The attacker needs knowledge of basic SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can enumerate databases using `sqlmap` and achieve OS-shell access for command execution, further highlighting the severity of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code snippet is provided:
```php
<?php
  $t_id = $_GET['tid'];
  $query = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM transaction WHERE transaction_id = '$t_id'") or die (mysqli_error());
  $fetch = $query->fetch_array();
```
