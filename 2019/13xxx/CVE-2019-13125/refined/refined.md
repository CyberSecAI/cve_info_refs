Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2019-13125:

**Note:** The provided content is from a GitHub issue report, and not an official vulnerability disclosure. This analysis is based on the information within the issue and may not be comprehensive.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this issue is the reliance on the `file` command output in HaboMalHunter to determine if a file is an executable. The `file` command identifies Position Independent Executables (PIE) as shared objects, not executables. Consequently, HaboMalHunter does not perform dynamic analysis on executables compiled with PIE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Incorrect File Type Detection:** The primary weakness is the reliance on the `file` command output to determine if a file is an executable.
-   **Bypass of Dynamic Analysis:**  The vulnerability allows malicious actors to potentially evade dynamic analysis by compiling malware with PIE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Reduced Detection Rate:** Malware compiled with PIE would bypass dynamic analysis by HaboMalHunter, decreasing detection rates.
-   **Increased Evasion:** Malware authors could use PIE to evade detection mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malware Compilation:** An attacker compiles malware using PIE to evade dynamic analysis of HaboMalHunter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Malware Development:** The attacker needs to develop malware.
-   **PIE Compilation:** The attacker needs the capability to compile the malware using PIE.
-   **Target System Knowledge:** Knowledge that the target system is using HaboMalHunter to analyze potentially malicious files.

**Additional Details:**
The GitHub issue provides concrete examples of:
    - How the `file` command identifies PIE as a "shared object."
    - How this impacts HaboMalHunter by preventing dynamic analysis on such files.
    - How to compile with and without PIE using gcc.
