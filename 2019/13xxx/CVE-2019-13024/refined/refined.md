Based on the provided content, the vulnerability described is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Centreon v19.04, triggered by injecting malicious code into the `nagios_bin` parameter. This matches the description of CVE-2019-13024 from the official CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unsanitized user input in the `nagios_bin` parameter, which is stored in the database and later executed via `shell_exec`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `nagios_bin` parameter is not properly sanitized before being stored in the database and later executed via `shell_exec`. The only filtering applied is `htmlentities`, which is insufficient to prevent code injection.
- **Unsafe Function Usage:** The use of `shell_exec` to execute user-controlled input without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full control of the server:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands, potentially gaining complete control of the compromised system.
- **Data Breach:** Could lead to data theft and/or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **System compromise:** Ability to install malware, create backdoors, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
-  **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of Centreon.
- **Configuration page:** The malicious code is injected when setting up or updating a poller configuration.
- **Database Interaction:** The vulnerability involves writing malicious code to the database which is then later executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs valid user credentials to access the Centreon web interface to inject the payload through the configuration page
- **Web access:** An attacker must have network connectivity to access the Centreon web interface.

**Additional details:**
- The content from `shells.systems` provides a very detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code snippets, the exploitation process and even a working python exploit.
- The content also mentions that CSRF tokens need to be handled, and that they are handled using `BeautifulSoup` library in the provided exploit.
- The documentation from `documentation.centreon.com` mentions that the vulnerability was fixed by using `escapeshellarg` on the `nagios_bin` binary.
