# Feature Request

About audited Directus version.

It has been cloned from suite repo.

Latest commit [directus/directus@1d151a9](https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/1d151a9034514e3f2ec1c80001e7c5fffdef2d4e)

## Description:

In Internet systems, there is sometimes a file upload mechanism, which allowing the user to upload files to share information between entities that communicate through the application. Files upload mechanism often generate direct links to download the uploaded files from the system. These mechanisms sometimes choose a name of file and store the uploaded file according to the name the chosen on the web server. A mechanism that defines file names in a sequence numbers is an insecure mechanism because it allows guessing of uploaded files more easily, thus allowing access to sensitive personal information.

## Business risk:

After exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can easily guess links to uploaded files.

## Technical details:

During the test, it was found that the application’s upload files mechanism generates static links to uploaded files, thing that allows an attacker to get access to uploaded files that were uploaded into the system, even if were uploaded by other users.

## What problem does this feature solve?

Fixes security hole.

## How do you think this should be implemented?

* Do not let users to get access to upload files that were uploaded by another users.
* Image ID should be chosen by unpredictable way and one-time random token should be appended to the

  link in order to prevent exact link guessing.
* Implement an authorization mechanism that validate if user authorized to view or download the specific file.

## Would you be willing to work on this?

Maybe, with help/guidance from Directus team.

# Feature Request

About audited Directus version.

It has been cloned from suite repo.

Latest commit [directus/directus@1d151a9](https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/1d151a9034514e3f2ec1c80001e7c5fffdef2d4e)

## Description:

Unauthenticated attackers can bypass the application's authentication enforcement and directly access internal components, effectively circumventing the authentication credentials validation phase.

## Business risk:

An attacker can get an access to the possible sensitive files.

## Technical details:

Forceful Browsing attacks (direct access to internal components) can be used to exploit incomplete authentication enforcement in the server-side application. The forceful browsing technique enables attackers to access internal sensitive components, without undergoing the application authentication credentials validation phase.

Through the following link it is possible to get an access to application images that should be accessible after the authentication.

## What problem does this feature solve?

Fixes security hole.

## How do you think this should be implemented?

* As a general rule, system components should not be accessible to unauthenticated users (excluding the authentication component, which is unique, as unauthenticated access to it is a functional requirement).
* The authentication enforcement mechanism should be thoroughly and comprehensively implemented in the system. The authentication validation should be performed as the first validation in each access to the system. The accessing entity should be obligated to authenticate with the system as a pre-condition to use the system’s services. After a successful authentication process, the user server-side session storage should be "populated" with the permissions of authorized actions.
* It is recommended to use authentication enforcement mechanisms that operate globally (effectively affecting all components), instead of implementing authentication validation within each separate component. Authentication validation implementation through applicative filters or infrastructure authentication declarations is highly recommended, since it is less likely to be prone to authentication flaws resulting from human error. Furthermore, these mechanisms are easier to manage and are usually well tested and widely used.

## Would you be willing to work on this?

Maybe, with help/guidance from Directus team.
