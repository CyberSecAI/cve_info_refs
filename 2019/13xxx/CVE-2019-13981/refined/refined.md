The provided content is related to CVE-2019-13981.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application's file upload mechanism generates static links to uploaded files, which allows attackers to guess and access files uploaded by other users. Additionally, the application does not properly enforce authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to directly access internal components and uploaded files by forceful browsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Insecure direct object reference:** The application uses predictable or sequential file names, making it easier for attackers to guess and access other users' uploaded files.
2.  **Authentication bypass:** The application does not properly enforce authentication, allowing direct access to internal components and uploaded files via forceful browsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files uploaded by other users.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Guessing file names:** Attackers can guess the static links to uploaded files due to the predictable naming scheme.
2.  **Forceful browsing:** Attackers can directly access internal components and uploaded files by directly requesting their URLs, bypassing authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to know or guess the URL of the uploaded files. This can be done by either guessing predictable file names or using forceful browsing to access the internal components directly. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
