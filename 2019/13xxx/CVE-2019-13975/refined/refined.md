The content is related to CVE-2019-13975.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The eGain Chat application (version 15.0.3) was vulnerable to HTML injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the chatbox.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness was the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the chatbox, which allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
1. Stealing agent credentials by creating a fake login page within the chatbox.
2. Redirecting agents to malicious websites.
3. Content spoofing and web interface defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious HTML code directly into the chatbox. This could happen when chatting with an agent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send messages into the chatbox. This could be a customer interacting with an agent via the chat function.
