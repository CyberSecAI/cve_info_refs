Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-13237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in several `closelink` parameters within the OpenCMS administrative interface. This allows for local file inclusion by manipulating the `closelink` parameter to point to files within the application's directory structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application does not properly sanitize the `closelink` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating this parameter with directory traversal sequences such as `..%2f..%2f`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read sensitive files from the server's file system, such as configuration files (e.g. web.xml) or log files. This could expose sensitive information like passwords, database credentials, or internal application details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP POST requests to specific administrative endpoints of OpenCMS. The `closelink` parameter is used within the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:**  The attacker needs to be authenticated to the OpenCMS administrative interface to exploit these vulnerabilities. This implies the attacker must have administrator access or compromised an administrator account.

**Specific vulnerable endpoints:**

The following resources/endpoints are vulnerable to LFI via the `closelink` parameter:

*   `/system/workplace/admin/workplace/loginmessage.jsp`
*   `/system/workplace/admin/contenttools/reports/xmlcontentrepair.jsp`
*   `/system/workplace/admin/accounts/group_new.jsp`
*    `/system/workplace/admin/history/settings/index.jsp`
*   `/system/workplace/admin/history/reports/clearhistory.jsp`
