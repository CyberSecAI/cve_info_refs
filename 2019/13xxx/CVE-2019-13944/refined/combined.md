The web interface could allow cross-site scripting (XSS), causing the application to behave in unexpected ways for legitimate users.

[CVE-2019-13943](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-13943) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L)).

#### 4.2.3    [RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)

A vulnerability in the integrated web server of the affected devices could allow unauthorized attackers to obtain sensitive information about the device, including logs and configurations.

[CVE-2019-13944](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-13944) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)).

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, is working on updates for the remaining affected products, and recommends specific countermeasures until fixes are available.

**--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------**

* EN100 Ethernet module for IEC 61850: [Update to v4.37](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/109745821)

**--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------**

For all other affected devices, Siemens recommends users block access to Port 80/TCP and 443/TCP (e.g., with an external firewall).

Siemens recommends operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place as the risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines to Secure Substations can be found at <https://www.siemens.com/gridsecurity>

For more information on these vulnerabilities and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-418979 at the following location:

<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block access to port 80/tcp and 443/tcp e.g. with an external ﬁrewall.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build
resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated

means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines to Secure Substations can be found at:

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The EN100 Ethernet modules are used for enabling process communication on either IEC 61850,
PROFINET IO, Modbus TCP, DNP3 TCP or IEC 104 protocols via electrical/optical 100 Mbit interfaces on
SIPROTEC 4, SIPROTEC Compact, Reyrolle and SWT3000 devices.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13942

An unauthorized user could exploit a buffer overﬂow vulnerability in the webserver. Specially crafted
packets sent could cause a Denial-of-Service condition and if certain conditions are met, the affected
devices must be restarted manually to fully recover.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13943

The web interface could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker is able to modify
content of particular web pages, causing the application to behave in unexpected ways for legitimate
users. Successful exploitation does not require for an attacker to be authenticated to the web interface.
This could allow the attacker to read or modify contents of the web application.
