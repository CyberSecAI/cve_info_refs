- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Some pages that should only be accessible by a privileged user can also be accessed by a non-privileged user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication check allows unauthorized access to restricted pages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with valid credentials can access information they should not be able to read. The affected information does not include passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the SINEMA Remote Connect Server web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs network access and valid credentials for a non-privileged user account on the web interface.
