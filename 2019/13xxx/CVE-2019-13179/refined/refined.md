    "CVE-2019-13179": {
        "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Calamares handles the LUKS encryption keyfile. Specifically, it copies the keyfile from `/crypto_keyfile.bin` to `/boot` within a globally readable initramfs image without setting proper file permissions.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
            "Insecure file permissions on initramfs images",
            "Exposure of sensitive LUKS keyfile"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with local access can read the initramfs image and extract the LUKS keyfile, allowing them to decrypt the encrypted disk.",
        "Attack vectors": "Local access to the file system where the initramfs image is stored (typically `/boot`).",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to read files from the filesystem, including the `/boot` directory."
    }
