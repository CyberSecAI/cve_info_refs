*   **Attack Vector:** Network, through a crafted HTML page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted HTML page to the victim. User interaction (visiting the crafted page) is required.

**CVE-2019-13700**
*   **Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds memory access in the gamepad API within Google Chrome's Blink engine.
*   **Vulnerability:** Out of bounds memory access leading to potential heap corruption.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker who has compromised the renderer process can potentially exploit heap corruption, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network, through a crafted HTML page.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to compromise the renderer process and deliver a crafted HTML page to the victim. User interaction is required to visit the malicious page.

**CVE-2019-13699**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the media component of Google Chrome.
*  **Vulnerability**: Use-after-free, leading to potential heap corruption.
*  **Impact**: A remote attacker, who has compromised the renderer process, can potentially exploit heap corruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network, through a crafted HTML page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires compromising the renderer process and crafting a malicious HTML page. User interaction (visiting the crafted page) is needed.

**CVE-2019-13702**
*   **Root Cause:** Inappropriate implementation in the installer of Google Chrome on Windows
*   **Vulnerability:** Privilege escalation
*  **Impact**: A local attacker can perform privilege escalation via a crafted executable.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local, through a crafted executable.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires local access to the system and the ability to execute a crafted file with user interaction.

**CVE-2019-13704**
*   **Root Cause**: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigation in Google Chrome.
*   **Vulnerability**: Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass.
*   **Impact**: A remote attacker can bypass the content security policy.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network, through a crafted HTML page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to serve a crafted HTML page to the user. User interaction (visiting the malicious page) is required.

**CVE-2019-13703**
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient policy enforcement in the Omnibox (URL bar) within Google Chrome on Android
*   **Vulnerability:** URL bar spoofing.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can spoof the contents of the URL bar via a crafted HTML page.
*  **Attack Vector:** Network, through a crafted HTML page
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted HTML page to the victim. User interaction (visiting the crafted page) is required.
