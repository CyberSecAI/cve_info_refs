## Automate and streamline IT systems management

As the quantity of endpoints you have to manage continues to grow, ad-hoc efforts, manual processes and disparate asset management solutions are no longer sufficient. What if you could address hardware and software asset management, bolster network security and better service your end-user systems — all with a single [endpoint management solution](https://www.quest.com/solutions/unified-endpoint-management/)? The KACE Systems Management Appliance lets you reduce management system complexity and safeguard your endpoints.

## Key benefits

Fulfill all your endpoint management needs, from initial procurement and deployment to ongoing management and retirement using an intuitive workflow for maximum productivity.

#### Secure network-connected devices

## Customer stories

#### Seminole County Public Schools

The KACE Systems Management Appliance provides both inventory and service desk on a single appliance, and it was far less expensive than the competitive solution we considered.

#### Jaeb Center for Health Research

We use the KACE Systems Management Appliance for managing all the software deployments and upgrades in our networks for all of our endpoints. Before we had KACE, we found it challenging to keep software constantly updated.

#### [SaaS Technical Specifications](#three)

#### [Feature requirements](#innerpanelthree-1234-1)

Some KACE Systems Management Appliance features require
direct access to the
customer’s network, which is
established for KACE as a Service using site-to-site VPN
connections. VPN connections
leverage the shared KACE as a Service network, and a single VPN
connection is usually
sufficient to enable the functionality for a single company. In
some cases, however,
additional VPN connections might be necessary, and dedicated
network bandwidth might be
required.

Features require a VPN connection:

* Wake-on-LAN.
* Network Discovery, including IP Scan, Active
  Directory® scan, and NMAP
  scan.
* KACE Systems Management Appliance Agent provisioning from
  the appliance.
* Importing and exporting resources (file sharing is blocked
  by the Dell cloud
  firewall).
* FTP access to backup files (FTP access is blocked by the
  Dell cloud
  firewall).
* Application packages and script dependencies must be
  uploaded using HTTP.
  Large package uploads could timeout on slower network
  connections. Packages
  larger than 2 GB must be distributed using an Alternate
  Download Location from
  an internal file server.
* LDAP user and device labels.
* LDAP user authentication.

* LDAP user import.
* Active Directory single sign on for the Administrator
  Console and User
  Console.
* Email forwarding, used for Service Desk tickets and other
  email
  communications.
* In addition, the following User Console features are not
  supported in the
  cloud:
* Automatic software installations from the User Console
  (downloads are
  supported).
* The My Computer tab in the User Console.
* For more information, see the KACE Systems Management
  Appliance as a Service
  Setup Guide. Go to <https://support.quest.com/kace-systems-management-appliance> to
