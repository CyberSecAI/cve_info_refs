{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input when creating a new mailbox, allowing a malicious user to inject XSS payloads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious XSS payload and injects it into the 'domain' parameter while adding a new mailbox.",
	  "The XSS payload is stored in the admin panel database when the mailbox is created.",
      "When the admin views or interacts with the email accounts, the payload is executed in their browser.",
	  "Specifically, the payload executes when any of the following actions occur: Change Password, Suspend, Delete."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the user panel to create a new mailbox. They also need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests using a tool such as Burp Suite in order to inject the XSS payload in the domain parameter.",
	"details": "The XSS payload is not executed in the user panel but is stored successfully and is executed when the administrator is performing actions on the email account list such as Change Password, Suspend and Delete. This could indicate that the XSS vulnerability is triggered in the admin panel due to lack of sanitization of the data being displayed there."
