Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the upgrade process of Little Snitch version 4.4.0.
- When Little Snitch 4.4.0 was installed, the operating system might have created a copy of the privileged helper tool.
- The upgrade to version 4.4.0 did not remove or update this copied privileged helper tool. This left the system vulnerable even after the upgrade.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Upgrade Process:** The upgrade procedure in Little Snitch 4.4.0 failed to remove or update all instances of the vulnerable privileged helper tool.
- **OS Copying Mechanism:** The operating system's behavior of potentially making a copy of the privileged helper, which the upgrade process does not account for, leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Systems could remain vulnerable even after upgrading to version 4.4.0, meaning the original vulnerability fixed in the update could still be exploited due to the presence of an old copy of the vulnerable component.
- The specific impact of the underlying vulnerability is not described, but the content does suggest a critical vulnerability that is being patched, so it can be assumed to be of a medium to high security risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker would likely exploit the original vulnerability that was fixed in Little Snitch 4.4.0, but would do so by targeting the old copy of the privileged helper tool that wasn't removed during the upgrade.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to be able to exploit the original vulnerability which is not further specified within the provided context.
- The attacker would need the target system to have upgraded to Little Snitch 4.4.0 and not have a later version installed.
- The attacker does not need to be in a privileged position, as the vulnerability exists within the component's executable itself.
