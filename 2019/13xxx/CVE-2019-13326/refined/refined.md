    {
      "ID": "CVE-2019-13326",
      "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of fields within Acroform objects. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it, within the processing of Acroform fields.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-After-Free"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
       "Attack vector": "The attack vector requires user interaction, where the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
      "Required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file with specific Acroform fields to trigger the vulnerability. No specific user privileges are required"
