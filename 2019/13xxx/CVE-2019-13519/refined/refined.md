Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-13519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a type confusion condition that arises due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of DOE files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion (CWE-843):** The application fails to correctly validate the type of data within a .DOE file, leading to type confusion when processing it. This can lead to unexpected program behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- This could enable the attacker to gain control over the affected system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a maliciously crafted Arena Simulation .DOE file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an unsuspecting user opens this malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and deliver a malicious .DOE file to the victim.
- The attacker requires a low skill level to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need to be present on the same network as the targeted system, meaning it is exploitable with local access.
- User interaction is required as the victim has to open a malicious file.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Rockwell Automation Arena Simulation Software versions 16.00.00 and earlier.
- A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned, with a vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- Rockwell Automation released version 16.00.01 of Arena Simulation Software to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by kimiya of 9SG Security Team, working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
