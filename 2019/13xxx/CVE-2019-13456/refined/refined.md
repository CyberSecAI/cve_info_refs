      "content": "The EAP-pwd module is vulnerable to a side-channel information leak. The password generation algorithm (the 'hunting and pecking' algorithm) uses a variable number of iterations to find the password element. If more than 10 iterations are needed, the handshake fails, sending an error frame to the client, leaking information about the password. An attacker can measure the number of iterations or identify the handshake failures, allowing them to reduce the size of the offline dictionary attack. The vulnerability can be abused to recover the user's WiFi password by performing dictionary and brute-force attacks. The attack requires the attacker to be able to run a program on the target device, or have the ability to measure the timing of the handshake and the failure of the handshake. This vulnerability affects FreeRADIUS version 3.0.0 through 3.0.19.",
