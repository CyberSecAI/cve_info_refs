  "ID": "CVE-2019-13496",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass OTP validation by replacing a failed SAML response with a previously captured valid one, due to a lack of proper integrity checks on the SAML response.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to perform adequate integrity checks on the SAML response after OTP validation, allowing an attacker to replace a failed response with a valid, previously captured one.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Bypassing OTP validation",
      "Lack of integrity checks on SAML responses"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the one-time password (OTP) authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and other malicious activities within the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack",
      "SSL-stripping",
       "Replaying captured SAML responses"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to perform a MITM attack, inject malicious JavaScript, intercept username, password, and OTP, and replace a failed SAML response with a valid one."
