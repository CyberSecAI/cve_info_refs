Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-13321

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Xiaomi Browser handles HTTP responses related to Captive Portals. Specifically, a crafted HTML response can cause the Captive Portal to open a browser to a specified location without requiring user interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended authorization process of the Captive Portal.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The browser fails to properly validate or sanitize the HTML response from the Captive Portal, leading to the unintended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability along with other vulnerabilities to execute code within the context of the current process of the Xiaomi browser.
- **Redirect to Malicious Content:** The attacker could force the browser to open a malicious website, which could then potentially launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Adjacent Attack:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim (e.g., connected to the same Wi-Fi).
- **Malicious Access Point:** The attack is initiated when the user connects to a malicious Wi-Fi access point controlled by the attacker.
- **Crafted HTML Response:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML response that is sent when the user tries to connect via the Captive Portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within network proximity to the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious access point that the victim will connect to.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious HTML response.
- No prior authentication or privileges are required.
- User interaction required but limited to connecting to malicious access point.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was resolved in Xiaomi Browser version 10.4.0 (versionCode: 20181211).
- The vulnerability was initially reported on 2019-04-02 and publicly released on 2019-07-12.
