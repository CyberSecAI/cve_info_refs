Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-13163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the TLS (Transport Layer Security) implementation within multiple Fujitsu Interstage and Systemwalker related products. This flaw allows an attacker to potentially decrypt encrypted communication between a server and a client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness lies in the way the affected products handle TLS connections, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks that can decrypt traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on and decrypt sensitive data being transmitted between the server and client. This could lead to the compromise of confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker intercepts and manipulates network traffic between the client and server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the client and server to intercept the communication. This typically requires network access within the organization or an ability to redirect network traffic.

**Additional Details:**
- The document provides a comprehensive list of affected Fujitsu products (Interstage and Systemwalker) along with specific versions and operating systems.
- It offers information on how to identify if a system is affected by checking the package versions.
- Fujitsu has released security patches to address this issue, and applying these patches is strongly advised.
- A workaround is mentioned where certain strong ciphers can be enforced to mitigate the vulnerability if patching is not immediately possible. However, both communicating parties must support this cipher suite.
- The document references CVE-2019-13163 and lists the official CVE URL.

This document provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerability and extensive information about affected products, which is more than what's provided in a typical CVE description.
