Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-13763:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Insufficient policy enforcement in payments" within the Chromium browser. This indicates a flaw in how the browser handles and enforces security policies related to payment processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Policy Enforcement:** The core issue is the lack of proper policy enforcement when handling payment-related operations. This likely means that the browser isn't adequately restricting access to sensitive payment data or functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Origin Data Leak:** A remote attacker, after gaining control of the renderer process, could exploit this vulnerability to leak sensitive data across different origins by using a specially crafted HTML page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack via Crafted HTML:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker who uses a malicious or specially constructed HTML page to target the vulnerable browser.
*   **Compromised Renderer Process:** A prerequisite for the attack is that the attacker has to compromise the renderer process of the browser. This is where the code for rendering and displaying web content is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Renderer Process Compromise:** Crucially, the attacker needs to compromise the renderer process within the Chromium browser. This could be achieved by exploiting another vulnerability, such as a code execution bug, or via some social engineering.
*   **Crafted HTML:** The attacker needs to prepare a specially crafted HTML page to exploit the policy enforcement weakness in the payment system.

**Summary of Information from Different Sources:**

*   **seclists.org:** Confirms that CVE-2019-13763 is a policy enforcement error and lists it as one of many Chromium vulnerabilities addressed in a Debian security advisory.

*   **chromereleases.googleblog.com:** Details the security fixes in Chrome 79, including CVE-2019-13763 and states the issue is with insufficient policy enforcement in payments.
*   **security.gentoo.org:** Also lists CVE-2019-13763 as one of multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Chromium and Google Chrome, and mentions that they could be exploited remotely.
*   **access.redhat.com (severity ratings page):** The severity of this particular CVE is described in more detail as a low impact vulnerability, but still categorized under "Important impact" vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The various sources indicate the vulnerability is related to the payments component and could lead to cross-origin data leaks if successfully exploited.
*  The vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 79.0.3945.79 and Google Chrome version 80.0.3987.132.

In summary, CVE-2019-13763 is a policy enforcement bypass vulnerability in Chromium's payments handling that allows a remote attacker with a compromised renderer process to leak cross-origin data via a specially crafted HTML page.
