{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper access control on the addon configuration pages and a missing check in the `rc.d/97NeoServer` script. Specifically, the `restart` command in the script bypasses the check for a 'Disabled' file, allowing the node.js process to start even when it should be disabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-284: Improper Access Control",
      "Missing check in service startup script."
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface can start/stop the node.js process of the 'Mediola NEO Server' AddOn, and obtain mediola configuration details by accessing the logs. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and disruption of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP requests to the web interface",
        "Direct calls to CGI script",
        "Accessing node.js service on port 8088 if available"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the affected system. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
     "additional_information": "The node.js service, running on port 8088, does not have any authentication setup. This can be exploited if this port is accessible. Additionally, the /getLogs endpoint allows access to the server logfiles and configuration details, and /reset endpoint stops the running node.js processes."
