Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13314:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `virt-bootstrap` tool in version 1.1.0 accepted the root password as a command-line argument using the `--root-password` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command-line Argument Exposure:** Passing sensitive information like passwords directly as command-line arguments exposes them to other users on the system through process listings.
*   **Lack of Secure Input:** The application did not implement a secure way of taking the root password as input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Disclosure:** Local users could discover the root password by inspecting the process listing.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With the root password compromised, an attacker could gain full control over the system or container being managed by `virt-bootstrap`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where `virt-bootstrap` is running.
*   **Process Listing:** The attacker would use standard system tools to view running processes and their command-line arguments (e.g., `ps`, `top`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Ability to View Processes:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands or use tools that can list running processes with their arguments.

**Summary of Information:**

The vulnerability arises from the insecure practice of passing a root password as a command-line argument to `virt-bootstrap`. This allows any local user to easily discover the password by viewing process listings. Successful exploitation leads to the exposure of the root password, potentially granting complete control of the system or containers.

The provided documents also mention fixes in various Linux distributions (Fedora, openSUSE, SUSE), which address the issue by preventing the password from being passed as a command line argument, or allowing it to be passed via a secure file, resolving the vulnerability by not exposing it in the process list.
