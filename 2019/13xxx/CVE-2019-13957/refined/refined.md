{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within a custom Backoffice API Controller developed on top of Umbraco, specifically in the `GetInpectSearch` method. This method is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input, specifically the `nodeName` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of successful exploitation is code execution. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or even execute malicious commands on the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Remote: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint with malicious SQL code in the `nodeName` parameter."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, typically the `umbraco/backoffice/PageWApprove/PageWApproveApi/GetInpectSearch` URL. They must also have knowledge of the specific endpoint and its parameters, in addition to the vulnerable parameter 'nodeName'."
  },
  "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is NOT within the official Umbraco CMS code, but within a custom controller, developed by a third-party. The provided URL `https://our.umbraco.com/download/releases/738/` is for Umbraco version 7.3.8 which does not contain the vulnerable code, but only refers to a custom controller build on top of the CMS. This vulnerability is specific to the custom controller implementation and would not be present in a default Umbraco installation."
