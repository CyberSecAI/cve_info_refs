Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13354:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `strong_password` rubygem version 0.0.7 was hijacked by an attacker who gained unauthorized access to the gem's publishing account on RubyGems.org.
*   The attacker injected malicious code into the gem's `lib/strong_password/strength_checker.rb` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Supply Chain Attack:** The attacker compromised the gem publishing process, introducing malicious code into a trusted dependency.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The injected code fetches and executes code from a remote pastebin service (`https://pastebin.com/raw/xa456PFt`).
*   **Cookie Injection:** The fetched code injects a middleware that evaluates base64 encoded code from cookies with the `___id` suffix.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize the input from cookies before eval, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Unconditional Execution:** The injected code executes unconditionally if the Rails environment is set to production, without checks or validation.
*   **Empty Exception Handler:** The `_!` function provides an empty exception handler, preventing error detection of the injected code.
*   **Lack of 2FA:** The original maintainer's rubygems.org account was compromised due to weak passwords and the lack of 2FA, which wasn't an option when the account was created.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary Ruby code on servers running the vulnerable version of the gem by setting a specially crafted cookie.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The code sends an HTTP request to a controlled domain with the infected host URLs, potentially enabling the attacker to track infected systems.
*   **System Compromise:** Full compromise of the server is possible due to the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Gem Account:** The attacker gained access to the gem's publishing account on RubyGems.org.
*   **Malicious Gem Injection:** The attacker injected malicious code into the gem and published a new version.
*   **HTTP Request Injection:** The attacker can send a request to the vulnerable application with a crafted cookie with the `___id` suffix.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised RubyGems Account:** The attacker needed to gain control of the gem's publishing account on RubyGems.org.
*   **Ability to Publish Gems:** The attacker needed to be able to publish new versions of the gem to RubyGems.org.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needed to host the malicious code on the remote pastebin service and control the domain where the exfiltration is sent.
*   **Understanding of Ruby and Rails:** To write the code injection to the vulnerable gem.

**Additional Details:**

* The malicious code was only triggered in production environments.
* The `Z1` constant was used as a flag to prevent re-injection of the middleware.
* The injected middleware relies on the presence of the `Faraday` gem for the notification to work, but many popular gems, such as `oauth2` and `stripe` includes it, making it likely the notification is sent.
* The vulnerable gem version was quickly yanked from RubyGems.org after the issue was reported.
