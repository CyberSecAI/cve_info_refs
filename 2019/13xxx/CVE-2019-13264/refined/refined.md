The provided document describes research into cross-router covert channels and their potential exploitation, and it mentions the assignment of CVE IDs to these issues, including CVE-2019-13264.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the fact that routers, intended to isolate logical networks (host and guest), share underlying hardware resources.
*   This shared hardware allows for the creation of covert channels by manipulating and observing the effects of resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, etc.) on the router's control plane.
*   The vulnerabilities are due to both implementation flaws (direct covert channels) and inherent limitations in software-based network isolation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Direct Covert Channels:**
    *   **DHCP Direct:** Improper handling of DHCP NAK messages where a NAK from one network is erroneously sent to the other network. The transaction ID field is used to encode data.
    *   **IGMP Direct:**  Joining and leaving an IGMP group on one network causes an IGMP Membership Query to be sent to the other network, allowing data encoding within the Group IP field.
    *  **ARP Direct:** Some routers forward ARP requests between host and guest networks, allowing data to be encoded in the IP address of the request.

2.  **Timing Covert Channels (Indirect):**
    *   These channels exploit the router's shared resources.
    *   They are created by combining "sender" and "receiver" gadgets that either increase load on the router's control plane or measure resource usage/response times.
    *   Examples of gadgets include:
        *   **SSH:** Initiating SSH key exchange to increase router CPU load (sender).
        *   **CSRF:** Repeatedly accessing the router's web interface via iframes (sender), measuring website render times (receiver).
        *  **DHCP Timing:** Sending DHCP requests and measuring response times (both sender and receiver).
        *   **ARP Timing:** Sending ARP requests and measuring response times (both sender and receiver).
        *   **ICMP:** Sending ICMP echo requests and measuring response times (both sender and receiver).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Malicious code on a guest network can leak sensitive data to a host network connected to the internet by using the router as a shared medium.
*   **Command and Control:** An attacker can send commands from the internet (via guest network) to an infected device on a protected host network.
*   Bypassing logical network isolation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious agent installed on at least one of the isolated network segments.
*   Malicious code execution on the device (e.g., via compromised IoT device, medical device or malicious JavaScript within an iframe).
*   Network traffic manipulation by sending specific requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Ability to install a malicious agent or execute malicious code on at least one device within either the host or guest network.
*   The ability to send and receive network traffic on the compromised device.
*   Basic knowledge of networking protocols, such as DHCP, IGMP, ARP, SSH, ICMP, and HTTP, and how to manipulate them.

**Additional Details:**

* The research paper explores multiple attack vectors and evaluates their effectiveness based on metrics like pervasiveness, rate, and covertness.
* The paper notes that some vendors did not acknowledge or address the reported vulnerabilities.
* The research proposes methods for detecting and preventing covert channels, including time slicing of router resources and adding random delays to responses to reduce channel capacity.

This research demonstrates that software based network isolation might not be enough to prevent data exfiltration from isolated networks by using shared router resources as covert channels.
