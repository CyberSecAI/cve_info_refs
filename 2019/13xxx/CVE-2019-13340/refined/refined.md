The provided content details three stored XSS vulnerabilities found in MiniCMS.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause for all three XSS vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before rendering it in the web application. This allows malicious JavaScript code to be injected and executed in the context of a user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are persistently stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected content. This can occur in:
    - `post-edit.php` (article content)
    - `conf.php` (comment)
    - `page-edit.php` (page content)
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied input, specifically the content fields in the admin interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal session cookies and take over user accounts.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker can steal sensitive information from the application or userâ€™s browser.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the displayed content of the web page.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect the user to malicious websites and spread malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector for all three is through the web interface.
    - An attacker with access to the administrative panel can inject malicious JavaScript into article or page content fields using the corresponding edit pages.
    - For the `conf.php` vulnerability, the attacker injects the malicious script into the comment field in settings, and the script is triggered when an article with comments enabled is viewed.
- The attack requires that an administrator or other authorized user enters the malicious payload using the cms interface

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the MiniCMS application to be able to edit posts and pages or access the configuration page.
-  An attacker does not need any special position or role to trigger the stored XSS once injected in the system
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the requests, in some instances, using a proxy (Burp Suite) to circumvent frontend validation/encoding
