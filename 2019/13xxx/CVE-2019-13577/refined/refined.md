    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SnmpAdm.exe component of MAPLE WBT SNMP Administrator software.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated remote buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a long string to the CE Remote feature listening on port 987, which overwrites stack data and registers.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to control program execution flow, leading to arbitrary remote code execution on the vulnerable system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote and involves sending a specially crafted long string over the network to port 987 of the targeted system running the vulnerable software.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need authentication and must be able to send network traffic to the target's port 987."
