Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Helper::getPartitionSizeInfo()` function of the `deepin-clone` application. This function uses a fixed path, `/tmp/partclone.log`, for a log file during the execution of the `partclone` utility.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Fixed Path:** The use of a fixed path for the log file makes the application susceptible to symlink attacks.
- **Symlink Following:** The application follows symlinks when writing to the log file at the fixed path.
- **Privileged Operation:** The `deepin-clone` application runs with elevated privileges (as root), which exacerbates the impact of the symlink vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can create a symlink at `/tmp/partclone.log` pointing to an arbitrary file system location. When `deepin-clone` attempts to write to its log file, it will instead write to the attacker-specified location, potentially overwriting or creating files anywhere on the file system.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While the content written to the log file is not directly attacker-controlled, it could be leveraged as part of a larger exploit chain to achieve privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to create the malicious symlink.
- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a symbolic link at the fixed path location before the vulnerable code executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create symlinks on the system.
- The attacker must be able to execute or trigger a function call to the vulnerable `Helper::getPartitionSizeInfo()` function within `deepin-clone`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves changing the log file location from the predictable `/tmp/partclone.log` to `/var/log/partclone.log`, which is not world-writable and mitigates the symlink attack.
- The vulnerability is present in `deepin-clone` versions prior to 1.1.3.
