Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13295:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-based buffer over-read within the `AdaptiveThresholdImage` function in `MagickCore/threshold.c`. This is triggered when the width of the image is zero, leading to a read past the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read
- Mishandling of zero-width images

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application crash due to invalid memory access)
- Potential unauthorized disclosure of information

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted image file

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide or cause the processing of a crafted image file to an application using ImageMagick
- No user interaction is required if ImageMagick is processing images automatically

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-50.
- The vulnerability is present in both ImageMagick 6 and 7, as seen in the patched files for both in the commit information.
- Patches involve adding a check for `width == 0` and return the `threshold_image` before any buffer access.
- Several distributions like openSUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu patched their versions of ImageMagick with updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity by SUSE, with a CVSS v3 base score of 5.1 (local attack). The NVD rates it as High (8.8) with a Network Attack Vector.
- The Suse Bugzilla entry is [1140664](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1140664)
