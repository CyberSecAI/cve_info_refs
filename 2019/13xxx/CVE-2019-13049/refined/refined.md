{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when mapping memory using the sysfunc syscall, allowing to map kernel memory into user space. This is not directly stated in the provided code, but implied in the code comments and other information about the exploit. The sysfunc call `TOARU_SYS_FUNC_MMAP` is used with arguments that cause an integer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow when mapping memory with sysfunc syscall.",
    "Lack of proper access controls on kernel structures from userland."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation to root. The exploit code modifies the `user` and `real_user` fields of the process structure to 0, granting root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local execution of a crafted program, leveraging a vulnerability in the operating system's syscall implementation.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user able to execute programs."
