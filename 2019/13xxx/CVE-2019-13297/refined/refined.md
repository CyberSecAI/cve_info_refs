Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-13297:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a heap-based buffer over-read within the `AdaptiveThresholdImage` function located in `MagickCore/threshold.c`. This occurs because the code doesn't properly handle a zero height value when processing an image.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:**  The vulnerability stems from reading beyond the allocated memory boundary on the heap due to improper handling of the image height.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service, potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive.
*  **Information Disclosure**: According to some sources, the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized disclosure of information due to the memory over-read.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   **Image file processing:** The primary attack vector involves processing a specially crafted image file by a vulnerable application that uses ImageMagick. This can be a remote or local process depending on how ImageMagick is used.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is described as "Network" by the NVD, implying the potential to deliver a malicious image over the network.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to supply a crafted image:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image that triggers the vulnerability, typically by having a zero height value or other malformed parameters that can be processed by `AdaptiveThresholdImage`
*  **User Interaction Required:** The NVD indicates that user interaction is required for the network attack vector, suggesting the attacker needs to trick a user into processing the malicious image. However, SUSE classifies this as a local vulnerability that does not require user interaction.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
*   **Specific function:** The vulnerability specifically exists within `AdaptiveThresholdImage` at `MagickCore/threshold.c`, and further identified at line `328:11` in one source.
*   **Versions affected**: The identified vulnerable version is ImageMagick `7.0.8-50 Q16`. Other versions may also be affected.
*   **CVSS Scores**: SUSE's assessment of the vulnerability differs slightly from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) in terms of CVSS v3 scores for both attack vector and confidentiality, integrity and availability impact, but overall they are still considered as having moderate severity.
*   **Patches and mitigation:** The content includes advisory information on patches and upgrades available for different Linux distributions including SUSE and Debian to fix the issue.
*   **openSUSE references many CVEs** This CVE is mentioned within a security advisory that also fixes other vulnerabilities within ImageMagick, including other buffer overflows and memory leaks.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-13297 is a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in ImageMagick that can be triggered by a specially crafted image file with a zero height value, potentially leading to denial of service and possible information disclosure. An attacker needs to get a user or automated system to process this crafted image.
