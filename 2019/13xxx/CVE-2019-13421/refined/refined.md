- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing property filtering in the Search Guard API. When an administrative user requests the "Internal User Database," the API response includes password hashes, even though the frontend only displays usernames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficiently protected credentials (CWE-522), specifically the exposure of bcrypt password hashes through an API response.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An administrative user can retrieve password hashes of other users by viewing the "Internal User Database". This could lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access if the hashes are cracked or reused.
- **Attack vectors:** An administrative user within the Search Guard system can send a request to `/api/v1/configuration/internalusers`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrative user within the Search Guard system to access the user database.
