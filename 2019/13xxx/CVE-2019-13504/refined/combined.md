This update fixes a number of memory access violations and other input
validation failures that can be triggered by passing specially crafted files to
exiv2.

CVE-2017-11591

    There is a Floating point exception in the Exiv2::ValueType function that
    will lead to a remote denial of service attack via crafted input.

CVE-2017-14859

    An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in
    Exiv2::StringValueBase::read in value.cpp. The vulnerability causes a
    segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.

CVE-2017-14862

    An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in
    Exiv2::DataValue::read in value.cpp. The vulnerability causes a
    segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.

CVE-2017-14864

    An Invalid memory address dereference was discovered in Exiv2::getULong in
    types.cpp. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application
    crash, which leads to denial of service.

CVE-2017-17669

    There is a heap-based buffer over-read in the
    Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::keyTXTChunk function of pngchunk_int.cpp. A
    crafted PNG file will lead to a remote denial of service attack.

CVE-2017-18005

    Exiv2 has a Null Pointer Dereference in the Exiv2::DataValue::toLong
    function in value.cpp, related to crafted metadata in a TIFF file.

CVE-2018-8976

    jpgimage.cpp allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (image.cpp Exiv2::Internal::stringFormat out-of-bounds read) via a crafted
    file.

CVE-2018-17581

    CiffDirectory::readDirectory() at crwimage_int.cpp has excessive stack
    consumption due to a recursive function, leading to Denial of service.

CVE-2018-19107

    Exiv2::IptcParser::decode in iptc.cpp (called from psdimage.cpp in the PSD
    image reader) may suffer from a denial of service (heap-based buffer
    over-read) caused by an integer overflow via a crafted PSD image file.

CVE-2018-19108

    Exiv2::PsdImage::readMetadata in psdimage.cpp in the PSD image reader may
    suffer from a denial of service (infinite loop) caused by an integer
    overflow via a crafted PSD image file.

CVE-2018-19535

    PngChunk::readRawProfile in pngchunk_int.cpp may cause a denial of service
    (application crash due to a heap-based buffer over-read) via a crafted PNG
    file.

CVE-2018-20097

    There is a SEGV in Exiv2::Internal::TiffParserWorker::findPrimaryGroups of
    tiffimage_int.cpp. A crafted input will lead to a remote denial of service
    attack.

CVE-2019-13110

    A CiffDirectory::readDirectory integer overflow and out-of-bounds read
    allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (SIGSEGV) via a crafted CRW
    image file.

CVE-2019-13112

    A PngChunk::parseChunkContent uncontrolled memory allocation allows an
    attacker to cause a denial of service (crash due to an std::bad_alloc
    exception) via a crafted PNG image file.

CVE-2019-13114

    http.c allows a malicious http server to cause a denial of service (crash
    due to a NULL pointer dereference) by returning a crafted response that
    lacks a space character.

CVE-2019-13504

    There is an out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::MrwImage::readMetadata in
    mrwimage.cpp.

CVE-2019-14369

    Exiv2::PngImage::readMetadata() in pngimage.cpp allows attackers to cause a
    denial of service (heap-based buffer over- read) via a crafted image file.

CVE-2019-14370

    There is an out-of-bounds read in Exiv2::MrwImage::readMetadata() in
    mrwimage.cpp. It could result in denial of service.

CVE-2019-17402

    Exiv2 allows attackers to trigger a crash in Exiv2::getULong in types.cpp
    when called from Exiv2::Internal::CiffDirectory::readDirectory in
    crwimage_int.cpp, because there is no validation of the relationship of the
    total size to the offset and size.

CVE-2020-18771

    Exiv2 has a global buffer over-read in
    Exiv2::Internal::Nikon1MakerNote::print0x0088 in nikonmn_int.cpp which can
    result in an information leak.

CVE-2021-29458

    An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2. The out-of- bounds read is
    triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file.
    An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial
    of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when
    writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than
    reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2
    command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument
    such as insert.

CVE-2021-32815

    The assertion
    failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the
    victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug
    is only triggered when modifying the metadata, which is a less
    frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For
    example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
    need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`.

CVE-2021-34334

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file.

CVE-2021-37620

    An out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata
    of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim
    into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.

CVE-2021-37621

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a
    crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
    Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when
    printing the image ICC profile, which is a less frequently used Exiv2
    operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p C`).

CVE-2021-37622

    An infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of
    a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim
    into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only
    triggered when deleting the IPTC data, which is a less frequently used
    Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-d I rm`).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.25-4+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your exiv2 packages.

### @yevgenypats **[yevgenypats](/yevgenypats)** commented [Jul 3, 2019](#issue-463698299)

This commit places the basics for libFuzzer integration with one

fuzzer which fuzzes the readMetadata function. The fuzzer is

located at fuzz/read-metadata.

To add more fuzzers please add them to ./fuzz directory as

described in the README.

Also a memory corruption bug is found using this fuzzer which

might lead to additional bugs after fix is pushed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Attached is the crash for the read-metadata.cpp fuzzer + screenshot of the backtrace.  I think this should also be given a CVE for a memory corruption vulnerability which affects programs that use the API to read bytes and not a file.  I'll be happy to contribute more fuzzers after this bug is fixed so it won't fail the other fuzzers.  Also, I'll be happy to contribute an integration to [Fuzzit](https://fuzzit.dev) (I'm the CEO of the company) which will enable continuous fuzzing for the project for free as it's an open-source project. you can read also about systemd case study [here](https://fuzzit.dev/2019/06/20/continuous-fuzzing-systemd-case-study/) [@clanmills](https://github.com/clanmills)  Not sure who is the right person to review the PR. but CCing [@kevinbackhouse](https://github.com/kevinbackhouse) as you merged a CVE bugfix lately.

| [@kevinbackhouse](https://github.com/kevinbackhouse) Yes, because you tried to reproduce with exiv2 which is a bit different because it's reading from a file i.e using this api: `ImageFactory::open(const std::string& path, bool useCurl)` and not `ImageFactory::open(const byte* data, size_t size)` which is a bit different and thus not getting to the buggy function which is `readMetadata`.  try to reproduce by running the fuzzer with the testcase I attached `./bin/read-metadata <test_case>` |

Wow, thanks for this contribution!

However, by removing `EXIV2_TEAM_USE_SANITIZERS` you effectively crippled our CI pipeline to no longer run with ASAN + UBSAN. Unless this is fixed, this PR is a nogo. Fixing this will probably require some refactoring of the CMake code, please tell if you want to undertake this (we can take care of that too).

| Sounds good. Will do regarding the additional PR with the link. Fuzzit has some more features that OSS currently missing like running the tests on PRs as well ( <https://fuzzit.dev/2019/06/20/continuous-fuzzing-systemd-case-study/>) and a bit better user management IMHO. Essentially you can use both if you want. Systemd uses both and we are working with envoy/the Google team on an integration as well so they also will use both. In my opinion you can just use Fuzzit, essentially we are running the same fuzzers. I think teams that uses both usually started with OSS fuzz and then added Fuzzit after we launched. But that's up to you. So If it's fine with you once we merge I'll open an additional PR which should be pretty straightforward as we already have the foundations for the fuzzers themselves:) … On Thu, Jul 4, 2019, 3:57 PM D4N \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> wrote: Yevgeny Pats \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> writes: > Hi Dan, > > Thanks:) I changed this per [@cryptomilk](https://github.com/cryptomilk) request.

| [@clanmills](https://github.com/clanmills): What you're seeing there is [#946](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/946), which I targeted at `0.27-maintenance`. The other fix is [#944](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/944), but I forgot to target that at `0.27-maintenance` when I created the PR, so it is currently targeting `master` instead. Would it be possible to get both [#946](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/946) and [#944](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/944) into v0.27.2? |

| We can put it into v0.27.2. However I don't like code changes between the final RC and Release.  If you feel this (and other good stuff) should go into 0.27.2, then we can do 0.27.2.3 (Release Candidate 3) this weekend, and release v0.27.2 at the end of July.  Team Exiv2 doesn't have a constitution or voting procedure because we usually agree! I'm happy to do what the team things is best! |

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : exiv2
Version        : 0.24-4.1+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13504

It was discovered that there was an integer overflow vulnerability
in exiv2, a tool to manipulate images containing (eg.) EXIF metadata.

This could have resulted in a denial of service via a specially-
crafted file.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this issue has been fixed in exiv2 version
0.24-4.1+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your exiv2 packages.

## Ship with speed and Security

 GitLab is the only platform that has all the security functionality that you need â for applications and APIs.
### Strengthen security and compliance with AI

Only GitLab provides AI throughout the software development lifecycle to help developers write more secure code â from AI-powered code suggestions and vulnerability explanations to AI-assisted generation of merge requests containing the changes required to mitigate vulnerabilities.

 [Learn more](/gitlab-duo/#features)
### Streamline identity and access management

Create a seamless experience for users to access security capabilities across the software development lifecycle â instead of logging into multiple separate tools, teams can authenticate into one secure platform.

### Mitigate risk with secret detection

Empower developers to proactively identify and remove leaked secrets in issue and epic descriptions to prevent credentials and other sensitive information from being visible to potential attackers.

### Manage vulnerabilities where developers work

Scan commits for secrets in the IDE before pushing to production and pull security findings into the IDE after pipelines run â so developers donât have to switch to a different tool to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

### Test and protect APIs

Identify and remediate API vulnerabilities before they make it to production to make APIs safer and reduce data breach risks.

### Automate scan enforcement and approvals

Use security policies to require specific security scans to run, or to ensure that particular security, legal, or compliance requirements are met before a merge request can be merged into the default branch.
