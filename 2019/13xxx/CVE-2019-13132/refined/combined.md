What a perfect mindset. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [FabHK](user?id=FabHK) [9 months ago](item?id=40004854)   | [prev](#40005323) | [next](#40005554) [–]  Meta comment on this (excellent) article: I liked the memes *and* the accessibility-friendly captions thereof. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eddd-ddde](user?id=eddd-ddde) [9 months ago](item?id=40004985)   | [parent](#40004854) | [next](#40006401) [–]  Now I'm really curious how blind people experience memes. Like if you read "cat at table meme" is it funny in it's own way? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [starttoaster](user?id=starttoaster) [9 months ago](item?id=40006365)   | [root](#40004854) | [parent](#40004985) | [next](#40006401) [–]  I imagine there's some amount of conditioning (for lack of a better word), and some amount of how well the meme author annotated it. Mostly just postulating, with a small amount of experience having been an assistant to a blind person for a short stint. But I imagine you're onto something, that as people who experience memes visually, we'd find the meme's description less funny than someone who relied on that description to experience the comedic effect of the meme; they might just use their imagination to fill in the gaps more naturally than we do. But there are of course limits to what details we can divine from our imagination, so I imagine there's a lot of memes where blind people are left contextless unfortunately. I don't know that everyone has one of these. But the professor I assisted for that aforementioned short stint also had a special braille printer, of course. I believe these printers have since advanced to the point of being able to render photos in a sort of limited fashion where the paper is indented to contour to lines. I believe there are also tactile tablets now for the visually disabled. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [theamk](user?id=theamk) [9 months ago](item?id=40006401)   | [parent](#40004854) | [prev](#40004985) | [next](#40005554) [–]  I find any sort of animated pictures next to the text supremely annoying. I had to scroll the text to keep them out of the screen just so I could read in peace. And yet you liked it... I wonder if this is a generational thing (I was born in 1980's)? Or "I don't run adblocker" thing? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fangpenlin](user?id=fangpenlin) [9 months ago](item?id=40007757)   | [root](#40004854) | [parent](#40006401) | [next](#40007436) [–]  Thanks for the feedbacks. The author here. Personally I found it more "fun" (well, I guess for everybody it's different) to have some meme in between of the articles, some people hate to read too much text all in once, but yeah, I get your point. So I was thinking maybe I should add a switch like "meme off" to hide all of those at the top of article so that people don't like it can feel better while reading it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [arcanemachiner](user?id=arcanemachiner) [9 months ago](item?id=40007436)   | [root](#40004854) | [parent](#40006401) | [prev](#40007757) | [next](#40008141) [–]  We should start a club.

At least for some people and for some values of laziness. This has got to be 30 years old or so: <https://thethreevirtues.com> According to Larry Wall, the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hubris: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jakjak123](user?id=jakjak123) [9 months ago](item?id=40006485)   | [parent](#40005554) | [prev](#40008244) | [next](#40007211) [–]  I have worked with non-lazy engineers too. The amount of convoluted barely working franken stuff they come up with is staggering. No obstacle will stop them from digging the hole deeper. Nah, they are alright. The real issue is they are so busy working, they never stop to really think about what they are building. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [somat](user?id=somat) [9 months ago](item?id=40008040)   | [root](#40005554) | [parent](#40006485) | [next](#40006717) [–]  “I divide my officers into four classes as follows: The clever, the industrious, the lazy, and the stupid. Each officer always possesses two of these qualities. Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can under certain circumstances be made of those who are stupid and lazy. The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest leadership posts. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity for difficult decisions.

There’s no boundary or size check. This is not normal. It's amateurish in the extreme that leads to the only conclusion that whoever wrote this ZeroMQ thing is not a real software engineer.

It's amateurish in the extreme that leads to the only conclusion that whoever wrote this ZeroMQ thing is not a real software engineer. I.e. stay away at all costs. I don't think that's a remotely fair assessment. ZeroMQ is a very large and quite popular project but it's also getting close to two decades old if I remember correctly. Any large C or C++ project that is that old is going to have quite a bit of historical cruft. And looking at some of the code that said vulnerability touched, most of that code was over a decade old. Not to claim that it's any less severe but this is the nature of long lived projects. Unless they are massively privileged, they tend to have more code than eyes to look at said code and said code often was written in the bad old days. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SPBS](user?id=SPBS) [9 months ago](item?id=40009892)   | [root](#40009277) | [parent](#40009386) | [next](#40013794) [–]  > it's also getting close to two decades old if I remember correctly. Any large C or C++ project that is that old is going to have quite a bit of historical cruft. I don't think writing arbitrary data into fixed-size buffer without boundary checks is just an artifact of being historical cruft, it's a ridiculous mistake no matter which time period it was written in. Whoever wrote that code decades ago *was* incredibly amateurish. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [smsm42](user?id=smsm42) [9 months ago](item?id=40009936)   | [root](#40009277) | [parent](#40009892) | [next](#40011435) [–]  That assuming the code was written that way initially. More often than not in long running projects pieces get moved around, refactored, functionality added and removed, and silent assumptions that were true before aren't true anymore. Somebody coded functionality for fixed data buffer, somebody else extended it with variable sized data but was not aware fixed buffers are being used, that stuff happens. We live in a myriad of glass castles, don't be so quick to throw stones around. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [PedroBatista](user?id=PedroBatista) [9 months ago](item?id=40011435)   | [root](#40009277) | [parent](#40009892) | [prev](#40009936) | [next](#40013794) [–]  The tone of some comments like this one makes me wonder if the authors ever wrote any software of reasonable complexity, on their free time while getting paid zero dollars. With such high standards I wonder why this people use such amateur software and not make or buy their own professional grade software. Also sheds light why truly free open source software is such a thankless and hazardous activity | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dangets](user?id=dangets) [9 months ago](item?id=40013794)   | [parent](#40009277) | [prev](#40009386) | [next](#40009421) [–]  Pieter Hintjens who started ZeroMQ, advocated for 'optimistic merging' as a strategy to encourage community & project building [1] (prev discussed in [2]).

We have discovered, as the global community of programmers, that humans are not smart enough to write C code without doing that. It is time to blame the language (or the species) and move on. Let's not pretend that the people writing the unsafe code are unimaginably stupid. They are extremely imaginably stupid, as we all are. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tus666](user?id=tus666) [9 months ago](item?id=40017928)   | [root](#40009277) | [parent](#40014583) | [next](#40009372) [–]  Most memory vulnerabilities are use-after-free which due to the nature of C is a very easy mistake to make. Buffer overflows are simple inexcusable, especially if its "we didn't bother checking" rather than "we got the size wrong due to human error". The first case is not normal, people like that should not be programming HTML let alone C code. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cjbprime](user?id=cjbprime) [9 months ago](item?id=40009372)   | [parent](#40009277) | [prev](#40009421) | [next](#40010071) [–]  I have some really bad news for you about OpenSSL. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wenbin1991\_sh](user?id=wenbin1991_sh) [9 months ago](item?id=40010071)   | [prev](#40009277) | [next](#40005048) [–]  the most interesting part is the last one -> hire me.. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pstrateman](user?id=pstrateman) [9 months ago](item?id=40005048)   | [prev](#40010071) | [next](#40006582) [–]  One the bug is in curbezmq not zmq.

To debug, I sat down to read a bunch of the zeromq code, just to realize that it was using assert() to handle wire protocol errors (unrelated to the blocking bug).

The library had shocking code quality issues. It's unlikely that they're all peachy now. The other side of this is that while Pieter's writing was marketing genius, it was also woefully understating the complexity of any practical use case. The way I tried to summarize that to folks who were keen to try zeromq then was that they should start at the back of the book with the most complex example, and that's by far the simplest setup that they could hope to end up with once they start thinking about putting something into production. And everything leading up to that - a book no less - was exclusively educational/toy use cases. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [samtheprogram](user?id=samtheprogram) [9 months ago](item?id=40005524)   | [root](#40005048) | [parent](#40005350) | [prev](#40005824) | [next](#40006502) [–]  > internal, but by design usually accessible on the public internet Your API can be accessible obviously, but put ZeroMQ behind a firewall so only the API server can reach it.

There are easier ways to achieve that than kubernetes with sidecar mesh. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [28mm](user?id=28mm) [9 months ago](item?id=40006502)   | [parent](#40005048) | [prev](#40005350) | [next](#40006582) [–]  Evidently it has never had such a certificate: <https://crt.sh/?q=curvezmq.org> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jart](user?id=jart) [9 months ago](item?id=40006582)   | [prev](#40005048) | [next](#40004868) [–]  > Reading code is underrated, and many software engineers don’t understand how and why they should read it. Reading code is much harder than writing code because writing code translates your thoughts into code, and reading code is the opposite. That's like saying reading Hamlet is harder than writing it. What kind of garbage do you have to be filling your head with all day to hold such a dismal opinion of software? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SPBS](user?id=SPBS) [9 months ago](item?id=40009119)   | [parent](#40006582) | [next](#40006806) [–]  It's true. The easiest code to read is the code you wrote yourself. To read other people's code, you have to decode it. And it's very easy to write convoluted "clever" code that you yourself will not be able to read six months down the line, like what Brian Kernighan meant when he said: "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." I strongly believe it's easier to write working code than it is to untangle it later on. Writing readable code is a skill. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ok123456](user?id=ok123456) [9 months ago](item?id=40006806)   | [parent](#40006582) | [prev](#40009119) | [next](#40009401) [–]  The modal programmer barely reads stack traces that tell them where exactly something is happening, even when it tells them exactly the mistake they're making. Digging into other people's code, reading it, and having enough education and context to understand why they did things a certain way is an even rarer skill. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [icedchai](user?id=icedchai) [9 months ago](item?id=40007001)   | [root](#40006582) | [parent](#40006806) | [next](#40009401) [–]  Yep.

Also, it gives you the heuristics to decide if a code base is crazy and not redeemable. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hobs](user?id=hobs) [9 months ago](item?id=40007488)   | [root](#40006582) | [parent](#40007051) | [next](#40007864) [–]  If you didn't get at least 1c per question like that, raise your rates! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [icedchai](user?id=icedchai) [9 months ago](item?id=40007864)   | [root](#40006582) | [parent](#40007051) | [prev](#40007488) | [next](#40009401) [–]  I don’t mind taking a look, but at least tell me you googled it first! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cjbprime](user?id=cjbprime) [9 months ago](item?id=40009401)   | [parent](#40006582) | [prev](#40006806) | [next](#40006657) [–]  Reading Hamlet is harder than writing your own, not very good, short story about something that you’re motivated to share. Reading Hamlet such that you fully understand its internal structures and design and could propose changes to it that maintain cohesion and do not make it drastically worse is harder still. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Zambyte](user?id=Zambyte) [9 months ago](item?id=40006657)   | [parent](#40006582) | [prev](#40009401) | [next](#40006858) [–]  Proprietary enterprise production code | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [floating-io](user?id=floating-io) [9 months ago](item?id=40006858)   | [parent](#40006582) | [prev](#40006657) | [next](#40008945) [–]  Reading most code is more akin to reading Hamlet fan fiction. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mistercheph](user?id=mistercheph) [9 months ago](item?id=40008945)   | [parent](#40006582) | [prev](#40006858) | [next](#40004868) [–]  Reading Hamlet is as hard as writing it, no reader has ever enjoyed the same pleasure the writer indulged, being finished. "Reading" Hamlet is something my pet hamster does for breakfast. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [teslabox](user?id=teslabox) [9 months ago](item?id=40004868)   | [prev](#40006582) [–]  This was not "pure luck". Reminded me of that quote about chance favoring the prepared: "Dans les champs de l'observation le hasard ne favorise que les esprits préparés." -Louis Pasteur ```   In the fields of observation chance    favours only the prepared mind.  ``` Variant translations of this or similar statements include: ```   Chance favors the prepared mind.    Fortune favors the prepared mind.      In the field of observation, chance favors the prepared mind.    Where observation is concerned, chance favors only the prepared mind.  ``` <https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur#Quotes> edit: "Louis Pasteur's quote "Chance favors the prepared mind" means that the better prepared and more knowledgeable you are, the more you'll be able to take advantage of any chance opportunities or observations. "If you are unaware of things that influence a situation or an event, you are very unlikely to be able to identify any opportunity or learn anything significantly new. By having insight, interest, and aptitude related to the situation, you put yourself in the position to capitalize upon any hidden "nuggets" buried at the moment." - <https://asymmetric.pro/chance-favors-the-prepared-mind/> | | --- | --- | --- | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c0)  Fabian Vogt   2018-02-22 15:09:41 UTC  ``` Certain licenses require that license files must be shipped together with the binaries in all cases.  By using the %doc marker, this is no longer guaranteed (e.g. by enabling excludedocs).  Thus it is important that for such cases, %license is used instead of %doc. The effect is that the file is always installed, stored in a different directory (/usr/share/licenses/<pkg>/) and can be queried using rpm (e.g. "rpm -qL kernel-firmware"). ``` [Comment

Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but any other files that may not be essential for the functionality?  That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

I have no problem whatsoever with excludedocs meaning that files tagged as %doc are not installed.  I have a problem with excludedocs being used in a way that breaks the existing intention and usage of the %doc tag in spec files. Whoever thought that using excludedocs to strip packages for inclusion in containers was a good idea was evidently wrong about that, as it required the introduction of the %license tag, so that there are now two useless tags: Not only can %doc no longer be used to simply mark up documentation files as intended because it's being subverted to mean something it did not do before, but the only reason %license exists is as a hack to work around the previously mentioned hack. ``` [Comment 199](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c199)  Fabian Vogt   2019-09-18 12:13:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #198](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c198)) > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #197](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c197)) > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #196](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c196)) > > > Is it too late to object to this change, which is completely misguided? > > >  > > > Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of > > > "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about > > > adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so > > > that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but > > > any other files that may not be essential for the functionality? > >  > > That's what optional subpackages are for though. > >  > > > That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, > > > and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

This is the document I read:  <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Use_license_macro_in_RPMs_for_packages_in_Cloud_Image>  >Use new %license macro to separate license files from documentation, so the latter can be excluded from container images without stripping license information which must be included.

That's not the only reason for %license though, it also allows to query the individual license files of packages and to ensure that every package ships its license file. Without %license that is not possible. ``` [Comment 202](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c202)  Kristoffer Gronlund   2019-09-18 13:26:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #201](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c201)) > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #200](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c200)) > > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #199](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c199)) > > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #198](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c198)) > > > > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #197](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c197)) > > > > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #196](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c196)) > > > > > > Is it too late to object to this change, which is completely misguided? > > > > > >  > > > > > > Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of > > > > > > "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about > > > > > > adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so > > > > > > that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but > > > > > > any other files that may not be essential for the functionality? > > > > >  > > > > > That's what optional subpackages are for though. > > > > >  > > > > > > That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, > > > > > > and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

(at least, that is what it looks like to me). If the goal is to reduce the size of packages, I would prefer if that was done explicitly via directives introduced for that specific purpose.  But sure, I'll give this meaningless crusade up and concede that %license has a legitimate use on its own. ;) ``` [Comment 206](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c206)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-10-02 16:11:55 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:2517-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes is now available.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 31 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Automatic R runtime dependencies](/wiki/Changes/Automatic_R_runtime_dependencies "Changes/Automatic R runtime dependencies")
* [Python means Python3](/wiki/Changes/Python_means_Python3 "Changes/Python means Python3")
* [The GNU C Library version 2.30](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC230 "Changes/GLIBC230")
* [Switch RPMs to zstd compression](/wiki/Changes/Switch_RPMs_to_zstd_compression "Changes/Switch RPMs to zstd compression")
* [Changes/MinGW environment and toolchain update](/wiki/Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Golang 1.13](/wiki/Changes/golang1.13 "Changes/golang1.13")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 24th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f31
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f31. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f31 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f31
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f31-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f31 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

## Description

![@fangpenlin](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/201615?u=02cc6e3bcafec066dd62cb5353dadfc9d0c511d6&v=4&size=48)[fangpenlin](https://github.com/fangpenlin)opened [on Jun 27, 2019](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3558#issue-461796328)

I found a critical security bug of libzmq and would like to report it confidentially, so that hopefully the bug can be fixed before we disclose it. It appears the only information I can find about reporting security bug is here in FAQ

[http://zeromq.org/area:faq#toc9](http://zeromq.org/area%3Afaq#toc9)

Besides opening an issue here, do you folks have an email address and corresponding GPG key I can send the details of this bug over?

# 0MQ version 4.3.5 stable, released on 2023/10/09

* Relicensing from LGPL-3.0+ (with custom exceptions) to MPL-2.0 is now complete.

  libzmq is now distributed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. Relicensing

  grants have been collected from all relevant authors, and some functionality

  has been clean-room reimplemented where that was not possible. In layman terms,

  the new license provides the same rights and obligations as before. Source

  files are now tagged using the SPDX license identifier format.

  Details of the relicensing process can be seen at:

  [#2376](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2376)

  Relicensing grants have been archived at:

  <https://github.com/rlenferink/libzmq-relicense>

  A special thanks to everybody who helped with this long and difficult task,

  with the process, the reimplementations, the collections and everything else.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:

  + ZMQ\_BUSY\_POLL will set the SO\_BUSY\_POLL socket option on the underlying

    sockets, if it is supported.
  + ZMQ\_HICCUP\_MSG will send a message when the peer has been disconnected.
  + ZMQ\_XSUB\_VERBOSE\_UNSUBSCRIBE will configure a socket to pass all

    unsubscription messages, including duplicated ones.
  + ZMQ\_TOPICS\_COUNT will return the number of subscribed topics on a

    PUB/SUB socket.
  + ZMQ\_NORM\_MODE, ZMQ\_NORM\_UNICAST\_NACK, ZMQ\_NORM\_BUFFER\_SIZE,

    ZMQ\_NORM\_SEGMENT\_SIZE, ZMQ\_NORM\_BLOCK\_SIZE, ZMQ\_NORM\_NUM\_PARITY,

    ZMQ\_NORM\_NUM\_AUTOPARITY and ZMQ\_NORM\_PUSH to control various aspect of

    NORM sockets.

    See doc/zmq\_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq\_getsockopt.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq\_ppoll APIs was added that differs from

  zmq\_poll in the same way that ppoll differs from poll.

  See doc/zmq\_ppoll.txt for details.
* Various bug fixes and performance improvements.

[libzmq 4.3.3](/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.3)

# 0MQ version 4.3.3 stable, released on 2020/09/07

* Security advisories:

  + CVE-2020-15166: Denial-of-Service on CURVE/ZAP-protected servers by

    unauthenticated clients.

    If a raw TCP socket is opened and connected to an endpoint that is fully

    configured with CURVE/ZAP, legitimate clients will not be able to exchange

    any message. Handshakes complete successfully, and messages are delivered to

    the library, but the server application never receives them.

    For more information see the security advisory:

    [GHSA-25wp-cf8g-938m](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-25wp-cf8g-938m "GHSA-25wp-cf8g-938m")
  + Stack overflow on server running PUB/XPUB socket (CURVE disabled).

    The PUB/XPUB subscription store (mtrie) is traversed using recursive

    function calls. In the remove (unsubscription) case, the recursive calls are

    NOT tail calls, so even with optimizations the stack grows linearly with the

    length of a subscription topic. Topics are under the control of remote

    clients - they can send a subscription to arbitrary length topics. An

    attacker can thus cause a server to create an mtrie sufficiently large such

    that, when unsubscribing, traversal will cause a stack overflow.

    For more information see the security advisory:

    [GHSA-qq65-x72m-9wr8](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-qq65-x72m-9wr8 "GHSA-qq65-x72m-9wr8")
  + Memory leak in PUB server induced by malicious client(s) without CURVE/ZAP.

    Messages with metadata are never processed by PUB sockets, but the metadata

    is kept referenced in the PUB object and never freed.

    For more information see the security advisory:

    [GHSA-4p5v-h92w-6wxw](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-4p5v-h92w-6wxw "GHSA-4p5v-h92w-6wxw")
  + Memory leak in client induced by malicious server(s) without CURVE/ZAP.

    When a pipe processes a delimiter and is already not in active state but

    still has an unfinished message, the message is leaked.

    For more information see the security advisory:

    [GHSA-wfr2-29gj-5w87](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-wfr2-29gj-5w87 "GHSA-wfr2-29gj-5w87")
  + Heap overflow when receiving malformed ZMTP v1 packets (CURVE disabled).

    By crafting a packet which is not valid ZMTP v2/v3, and which has two

    messages larger than 8192 bytes, the decoder can be tricked into changing

    the recorded size of the 8192 bytes static buffer, which then gets overflown

    by the next message. The content that gets written in the overflown memory

    is entirely decided by the sender.

    For more information see the security advisory:

    [GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6 "GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6")
* Note for packagers: an external, self-contained sha1 library is now

  included in the source tree under external/sha1/ - it is licensed

  under BSD-3-Clause and thus it is fully compatible with libzmq's

  license.

  It is only used if WebSockets support is enabled, and if neither GnuTLS nor

  NSS are available.
* Note for packagers: an internal reimplementation of strlcpy is now included,

  for wider platform compatibility.

  libbsd can be used and is enabled by default if available instead of the

  internal implementation, for better security maintenance in distros.
* Note for packagers: ZeroMQConfig.cmake is now installed in the arch-dependent

  subdirectory - eg: /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/cmake/
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket type:

  + ZMQ\_CHANNEL is a thread-safe alternative to ZMQ\_PAIR.

    See doc/zmq\_socket.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket option:

  + ZMQ\_ONLY\_FIRST\_SUBSCRIBE will cause only the first part of a multipart

    message to be processed as a subscribe/unsubscribe message, and the rest

    will be forwarded as user data to the application.
  + ZMQ\_RECONNECT\_STOP will cause a connecting socket to stop trying to

    reconnect in specific circumstances. See the manpage for details.
  + ZMQ\_HELLO\_MSG to set a message that will be automatically sent to a new

    connection.
  + ZMQ\_DISCONNECT\_MSG to set a message that will be automatically received when

    a peer disconnects.

    See doc/zmq\_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq\_getsockopt.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq\_ctx\_get\_ext/zmq\_ctx\_set\_ext APIs were added

  to allow enhancing the context options with variable data inputs.

  See doc/zmq\_ctx\_get\_ext.txt and doc/zmq\_ctx\_set\_ext.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) transport options WS and WSS added for support

  of WebSockets (and secure WebSockets via TLS) via the ZWS 2.0 protocol.

  WSS requires the GnuTLS library for TLS support. ZMQ\_WSS\_ specific socket

  options were added to support TLS.

  WebSockets support is disabled by default if DRAFT APIs are disabled.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket type, PEER, which is thread safe and a

  related zmq\_connect\_peer function which atomically and thread-safely connects

  and returns a routing-id.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq\_msg\_init\_buffer API was added to allow

  the construction of a message by copying from an existing buffer.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq\_poller\_size API was added to allow querying

  the number of sockets/fds registered in a zmq\_poller.
* ZMTP 3.1 peers will receive subscribe/cancel on PUB/SUB via commands rather

  than using the first byte of the payload.
* zmq\_z85\_decode now checks that the input string's length is at least 5 characters

  and always a multiple of 5 as per API specification.
* Fixed [#3566](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3566) - malformed CURVE message can cause memory leak
* Fixed [#3567](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3567) - missing ZeroMQ\_INCLUDE\_DIR in ZeroMQConfig.cmake when only

  static lib is built

[libzmq 4.3.2](/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.2)

# 0MQ version 4.3.2 stable, released on 2019/07/08

* [CVE-2019-13132](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pf98-hx9m-qj7w "CVE-2019-13132"): a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a

  libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE

  encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and

  overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in

  the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration

  are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no

  known mitigations. All versions from 4.0.0 and upwards are affected.

  Thank you Fang-Pen Lin for finding the issue and reporting it!
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq\_socket\_monitor\_versioned API that supports

  a versioned monitoring events protocol as a parameter. Passing 1 results in

  the same behaviour as zmq\_socket\_monitor.

  Version 2 of the events protocol allows new events, new metadata, different

  socket types for the monitors and more. It is described in details in

  doc/zmq\_socket\_monitor\_versioned.txt
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq\_socket\_monitor\_pipes\_stats that triggers

  a new ZMQ\_EVENT\_PIPES\_STATS to be delivered via zmq\_socket\_monitor\_versioned

  v2 API, which contains the current status of all the queues owned by the

  monitored socket. See doc/zmq\_socket\_monitor\_versioned.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq\_poller\_fd that returns the FD of a thread

  safe socket. See doc/zmq\_poller.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:

  + ZMQ\_XPUB\_MANUAL\_LAST\_VALUE is similar to ZMQ\_XPUB\_MANUAL but allows to avoid

    duplicates when using last value caching.
  + ZMQ\_SOCKS\_USERNAME and ZMQ\_SOCKS\_PASSWORD that implement SOCKS5 proxy

    authentication.

    See doc/zmq\_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq\_getsockopt.txt for details.
* Implemented background thread names for Windows, when the Visual Studio

  debugger is being used.
* Fixed [#3358](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3358) - test\_security\_zap failing due to SIGBUS on SPARC64, hard-coded

  IPC socket binds in tests cause race conditions
* Fixed [#3361](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3361) - enabling GSSAPI support (when using autools) does not work due

  to regression introduced in 4.2.3
* Fixed [#3362](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3362) - remove documentation for ZMQ\_THREAD\_PRIORITY context option

  getter, it's not implemented
* Fixed [#3363](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3363) - tests fail to build due to stricter compiler printf validation

  in new versions of GCC
* Fixed [#3367](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3367) - try to infer cacheline size at build time, first with

  getconf LEVEL1\_DCACHE\_LINESIZE, and then by reading

  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/coherency\_line\_size

  (autoconf only), and only then falling back to the previous

  default of 64 bytes. Avoids false sharing on POWER and s390x.

  Import ax\_func\_posix\_memalign.m4 as a more reliable check for

[libzmq 4.3.1](/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.1)

# 0MQ version 4.3.1 stable, released on 2019/01/12

* [CVE-2019-6250](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-383h-xx34-hq84 "CVE-2019-6250"): A vulnerability has been found that would allow attackers to direct a peer to

  jump to and execute from an address indicated by the attacker.

  This issue has been present since v4.2.0. Older releases are not affected.

  NOTE: The attacker needs to know in advance valid addresses in the peer's

  memory to jump to, so measures like ASLR are effective mitigations.

  NOTE: this attack can only take place after authentication, so peers behind

  CURVE/GSSAPI are not vulnerable to unauthenticated attackers.

  See [#3351](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351) for more details.

  Thanks to Guido Vranken for uncovering the issue and providing the fix!
* Note for packagers: as pkg-config's Requires.private is now used to properly

  propagate dependencies for static builds, the libzmq\*-dev or zeromq-devel or

  equivalent package should now depend on the libfoo-dev or foo-devel packages

  of all the libraries that zmq is linked against, or pkg-config --libs libzmq

  will fail due to missing dependencies on end users machines.
* Fixed [#3351](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351) - remote code execution vulnerability.
* Fixed [#3343](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3343) - race condition in ZMQ\_PUSH when quickly disconnecting and

  reconnecting causes last part of multi-part message to get

  "stuck" and resent by mistake to the new socket.
* Fixed [#3336](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3336) - set Requires.private in generate pkg-config file.
* Fixed [#3334](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3334) - set TCP\_NODELAY after connect() on Windows for the I/O socket.
* Fixed [#3326](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3326) - assert on Android when opening a socket and disabling WiFi.
* Fixed [#3320](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3320) - build failure on OpenBSD with GCC.

[libzmq 4.3.0](/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.0)

# 0MQ version 4.3.0 stable, released on 2018/11/28

* The following DRAFT APIs have been marked as STABLE and will not change

  anymore:

  + ZMQ\_MSG\_T\_SIZE context option (see doc/zmq\_ctx\_get.txt)
  + ZMQ\_THREAD\_AFFINITY\_CPU\_ADD and ZMQ\_THREAD\_AFFINITY\_CPU\_REMOVE (Posix only)

    context options, to add/remove CPUs to the affinity set of the I/O threads.

    See doc/zmq\_ctx\_set.txt and doc/zmq\_ctx\_get.txt for details.
  + ZMQ\_THREAD\_NAME\_PREFIX (Posix only) context option, to add a specific

    integer prefix to the background threads names, to easily identify them.

    See doc/zmq\_ctx\_set.txt and doc/zmq\_ctx\_get.txt for details.
  + ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_PRINCIPAL\_NAMETYPE and ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_SERVICE\_PRINCIPAL\_NAMETYPE

    socket options, for the corresponding GSSAPI features. Additional

    definitions for principal name types:
    - ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_NT\_HOSTBASED
    - ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_NT\_USER\_NAME
    - ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_NT\_KRB5\_PRINCIPAL

      See doc/zmq\_gssapi.txt for details.
  + ZMQ\_BINDTODEVICE socket option (Linux only), which will bind the

    socket(s) to the specified interface. Allows to use Linux VRF, see:

    <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt>

    NOTE: requires the program to be ran as root OR with CAP\_NET\_RAW
  + zmq\_timers\_\* APIs. These functions can be used for cross-platforms timed

    callbacks. See doc/zmq\_timers.txt for details.
  + The following socket monitor events:
    - ZMQ\_EVENT\_HANDSHAKE\_FAILED\_NO\_DETAIL: unknown errors during handshake.
    - ZMQ\_EVENT\_HANDSHAKE\_SUCCEEDED: Handshake completed with authentication.
    - ZMQ\_EVENT\_HANDSHAKE\_FAILED\_PROTOCOL: Protocol errors with peers or ZAP.
    - ZMQ\_EVENT\_HANDSHAKE\_FAILED\_AUTH: Failed authentication requests.

      See doc/zmq\_socket\_monitor.txt for more details and error codes.
  + zmq\_stopwatch\_intermediate which returns the time elapsed without stopping

    the stopwatch.
  + zmq\_proxy\_steerable command 'STATISTICS' to retrieve stats about the amount

    of messages and bytes sent and received by the proxy.

    See doc/zmq\_proxy\_steerable.txt for more information.
* The build-time configuration option to select the poller has been split, and

  new API\_POLLER (CMake) and --with-api-poller (autoconf) options will now

  determine what system call is used to implement the zmq\_poll/zmq\_poller APIs.

  The previous POLLER and --with-poller options now only affects the

  internal I/O thread. In case API\_POLLER is not specified, the behaviour keeps

  backward compatibility intact and will be the same as with previous releases.
* The non-default "poll" poller for the internal I/O thread (note: NOT for the

  zmq\_poll/zmq\_poller user APIs!) has been disabled on Windows as WSAPoll does

  not report connection failures. For more information see:

  + <https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2012/10/10/wsapoll-is-broken/>
  + <https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-10/0038.html>
  + <https://bugs.python.org/issue16507>
* New epoll implementation for Windows, using the following implementation:

  <https://github.com/piscisaureus/wepoll/tree/v1.5.4>

  To use this, select "epoll" as the poller option in the build system.

  Note for distributors: the wepoll source code is embedded and distributed.

  It is licensed under the BSD-2-Clause and thus it is compatible with LGPL-3.0.

  Note that, if selected at build time, the license text must be distributed

  with the binary in accordance to the license terms. A copy can be found at:

  external/wepoll/license.txt
* The pre-made Visual Studio solutions file are deprecated, and users are

  encouraged to use the CMake solution generation feature instead.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:

  + ZMQ\_ROUTER\_NOTIFY to deliver a notification when a peer connects and/or

    disconnects in the form of a routing id plus a zero-length frame.
  + ZMQ\_MULTICAST\_LOOP to control whether the data sent should be looped back

    on local listening sockets for UDP multicast sockets (ZMQ\_RADIO).

    See doc/zmq\_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq\_getsockopt.txt for details.
* New perf tool, perf/benchmark\_radix\_tree, to measure the performance of the

  different internal implementations of the trie algorithm used to track

  subscriptions. Requires a compiler that supports C++11.
* New autoconf flag "--enable-force-CXX98-compat" which will force -std=gnu++98

  and, if the compiler supports them (clang++ at the moment), it will also add

  -Wc++98-compat -Wc++98-compat-pedantic so that compatibility with C++98 can

  be tested.
* Many, many coding style, duplication and static analysis improvements.
* Many, many improvements to the CMake build system, especially on Windows.
* Many, many improvements to unit tests.
* Fixed [#3036](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3036) - Compilation error when -pedantic is used.

* Fixed [#3060](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3060) - REQ sockets terminate TCP connection after first heartbeat if

  ZMQ\_HEARTBEAT\_IVL is set.
* Fixed [#2212](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2212) - UDP: need ability to specify bind address separately from

  multicast address for multi-homed hosts.
* Fixed [#2891](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2891) - UDP: address name resolution is limited to dotted IPv4 rather

  than being capable of IPv4, IPv6, and hostname lookup.
* Fixed [#3085](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/3085) - autoconf/CMake getrandom test does not check if it's working but

  only for its presence.

# 0MQ version 4.2.3 stable, released on 2017/12/13

* API change: previously ZMQ\_POLLOUT on a ZMQ\_ROUTER socket returned always

  true due to how the type works. When ZMQ\_ROUTER\_MANDATORY is set, sending

  fails when the peer is not available, but ZMQ\_POLLOUT always returns true

  anyway, which does not make sense. Now when ZMQ\_ROUTER\_MANDATORY is set,

  ZMQ\_POLLOUT on a ZMQ\_ROUTER will return true only if at least one peer is

  available.

  Given ZMQ\_POLLOUT with ZMQ\_ROUTER was not usable at all previously, we do

  not consider this a breakage warranting a major or minor version increase.
* ZMQ\_IDENTITY has been renamed to ZMQ\_ROUTING\_ID and ZMQ\_CONNECT\_RID has been

  renamed to ZMQ\_CONNTECT\_ROUTING\_ID to disambiguate. ZMQ\_IDENTITY and

  ZMQ\_CONNECT\_RID are still available to keep backward compatibility, and will

  be removed in a future release after further advance notice.
* DRAFT API change: zmq\_poller\_wait, zmq\_poller\_wait\_all and zmq\_poller\_poll

  have been changed to be inline with other existing APIs that have a timeout

  to return EAGAIN instead of ETIMEDOUT as the errno value.

  See [#2713](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2713) for details.
* Existing non-DRAFT socket types ZMQ\_REP/REQ, ZMQ\_ROUTER/DEALER and

  ZMQPUB/SUB, that were previously declared deprecated, have been reinstated

  as stable and supported. See [#2699](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2699) for details.
* Tweetnacl: add support for, and use preferably if available, getrandom() as

  a simpler and less error-prone alternative to /dev/urandom on OSes where it

  is available (eg: Linux 3.18 with glibc 2.25).
* Curve: all remaining traces of debug output to console are now removed, and

  new DRAFT events are available to properly debug CURVE, PLAIN, GSSAPI and

  ZAP events and failures. See below for details on the new events.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) socket options:

  + ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_PRINCIPAL\_NAMETYPE and ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_SERVICE\_PRINCIPAL\_NAMETYPE, for

    the corresponding GSSAPI features. Additional definitions for principal

    name types:
    - ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_NT\_HOSTBASED
    - ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_NT\_USER\_NAME
    - ZMQ\_GSSAPI\_NT\_KRB5\_PRINCIPAL

      See doc/zmq\_gssapi.txt for details.
  + ZMQ\_BINDTODEVICE (Linux only), which will bind the socket(s) to the

    specified interface. Allows to use Linux VRF, see:

    <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt>

    NOTE: requires the program to be ran as root OR with CAP\_NET\_RAW
  + ZMQ\_ZAP\_ENFORCE\_DOMAIN, enables strict RFC 27 compatibility mode and makes

    the ZAP Domain mandatory when using security. See:

    [https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27/ZAP](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec%3A27/ZAP)

    See doc/zmq\_setsockopt.txt and doc/zmq\_getsockopt.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) context options:

  + ZMQ\_THREAD\_AFFINITY\_CPU\_ADD and ZMQ\_THREAD\_AFFINITY\_CPU\_REMOVE (Posix only),

    to add and remove CPUs to the affinity set of the I/O threads. Useful to pin

    the background threads to specific CPUs.
  + ZMQ\_THREAD\_NAME\_PREFIX (Posix only), to add a specific integer prefix to the

    background threads names, to easily identify them for debugging purposes.

    See doc/zmq\_ctx\_set.txt and doc/zmq\_ctx\_get.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) message property name definitions to facilitate

  the use of zmq\_msg\_gets:

  + ZMQ\_MSG\_PROPERTY\_ROUTING\_ID
  + ZMQ\_MSG\_PROPERTY\_SOCKET\_TYPE
  + ZMQ\_MSG\_PROPERTY\_USER\_ID
  + ZMQ\_MSG\_PROPERTY\_PEER\_ADDRESS

    See doc/zmq\_msg\_gets.txt for details.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) API zmq\_socket\_get\_peer\_state, to be used to

  query the state of a specific peer (via routing-id) of a ZMQ\_ROUTER socket.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) Socket Monitor events:

  + ZMQ\_EVENT\_HANDSHAKE\_FAILED\_NO\_DETAIL, unknown system error and returns errno
  + ZMQ\_EVENT\_HANDSHAKE\_SUCCEEDED, handshake was successful
  + ZMQ\_EVENT\_HANDSHAKE\_FAILED\_PROTOCOL, protocol errors between peers or server

    and ZAP handler. Returns one of ZMQ\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_\* - see manpage for list
  + ZMQ\_EVENT\_HANDSHAKE\_FAILED\_AUTH, failed authentication, returns ZAP status

    These events trigger when the ZMTP security mechanism handshake is

    completed or failed. See doc/zmq\_socket\_monitor.txt for more information.
* New DRAFT (see NEWS for 4.2.0) zmq\_proxy\_steerable command 'STATISTICS' to

  retrieve stats about the amount of messages and bytes sent and received by

  the proxy. See doc/zmq\_proxy\_steerable.txt for more information.
* Add new autoconf --disable-libunwind option to stop building with libunwind

  even if it is available.
* Add new autoconf --disable-Werror option to avoid building with the Werror

  flag.
* Use pkg-config as the first method for finding and building with external

  optional dependencies such as libnorm, libpgm and gssapi.
* On Posix platform where the feature is available, name the ZMQ background

  threads to simplify debugging: "ZMQbg/<num\_thread>"
* Improve performance of zmq\_poller\_\* (and zmq\_poll and zmq\_proxy when building

  with DRAFT APIs enabled).
* The TCP unit tests have been refactored to bind and connect to random ports

  rather than hard-coded ones, to allow running tests in parallel.

  There are 6 exceptions where it is necessary to use an hard-coded port to

  test specific code paths that would not be exercised when binding to a

  wildcard port. These are listed in tests/testutil.hpp so that distributions

  can easily patch them if they wish to and so that they can be unique across

  all the tests, allowing parallel runs.

  The IPC unit tests have been changed as well to use unique socket file names

  per test, where before there were some clashes.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-13132 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13132)

#### Description

In ZeroMQ libzmq before 4.0.9, 4.1.x before 4.1.7, and 4.2.x before 4.3.2, a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no known mitigations.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Package        : zeromq3
Version        : 4.0.5+dfsg-2+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13132

Fang-Pen Lin discovered a stack-based buffer-overflow flaw in ZeroMQ, a
lightweight messaging kernel library. A remote, unauthenticated client
connecting to an application using the libzmq library, running with a
socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
4.0.5+dfsg-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your zeromq3 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# How I discovered a 9.8 critical security vulnerability in ZeroMQ with mostly pure luck and my two cents about xz backdoor

Apr 7, 2024

14 minute read

If you work in the tech industry, I bet you have heard the crazy story of the XZ backdoor. Long story short, an open-source contributor known as Jia Tan contributed to the XZ library. After spending more than two years gaining the trust of the original author, that person (or persona) patched the software with layers of obfuscation and batch scripts extracted from seemingly harmless testing binary files. Eventually, a backdoor was injected into sshd, allowing the attacker to execute remote code. If you are interested in the story, you can read more about it, you can read the following articles:

* [Everything I Know About the XZ Backdoor](https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor)
* [xz/liblzma: Bash-stage Obfuscation Explained](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=782)

The backdoor was discovered by a principal software engineer working for Microsoft who happened to be testing PostgreSQL performance and noticed abnormal CPU usage after updating his Linux system. More importantly, he looked into why that was and found that backdoor.

Not as intensive as XZ backdoor story, but today, I would like to share my story of how I found [CVE-2019-13132](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13132), a critical security vulnerability with a CVSS 3 score of 9.8 in ZeroMQ, primarily because of pure luck, and also my two cents about this xz backdoor event.

## Back in time

In 2019, I worked as a software engineer with [Niantic](https://nianticlabs.com/)’s augmented-reality team. The AR team builds some services relying on [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/), a library with different messaging queue patterns that act similarly to the BSD socket. I was in charge of designing and building the authentication mechanism for ZeroMQ-based connections. As a software engineer, I am lazy, so I always love to reuse existing tools as much as possible. That’s when I found out about [CurveZMQ](http://curvezmq.org/), a protocol extension on top of ZeroMQ designed to authenticate ZeroMQ connections based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

I didn’t know much about Elliptic Curve Cryptography at that time. As an engineer, using something I don’t understand is always scary. I also will only be able to use most of it if I truly understand how it works. That’s why I decided to take the chance to learn how Elliptic Curve Cryptography works. I spent some time learning how it works but found very few articles on the internet explaining it well; that’s why I published [Elliptic Curve Cryptography Explained](/posts/2019/10/07/elliptic-curve-cryptography-explained/) back then.

CurveZMQ greatly helps authenticate the connection and establish an encrypted channel between peers, but my job also includes checking an authentication token issued by another server to see if the access grant expires. Once again, I am not a big fan of rebuilding the wheel, so I then looked into CurveZMQ documents and found the `metadata` field in the protocol. It turns out I can put some arbitrary key-value data into the authentication payload as the metadata.

> Awesome! That’s all I need 😄

But I wondered what the upper limit of `metadata` size is. If we extend the authentication payload in the future, would it still work? So, I read the source code to find out.

## Reading the source code and find out

By reading the source code, I realized that the incoming data was put into a fixed-size static buffer in the stack, and the payload was decrypted into another fixed-size buffer. There’s no boundary or size check.

> Wait, could it be a stack overflow bug? 🤔

I quickly wrote a piece of code and fed a ton of data into the metadata field when connecting to a CurveZMQ socket. See how it goes. And boom, it crashed.

![Blow my mind Gif meme](/images/2024-04-07-how-i-discovered-a-9-point-8-critical-security-vulnerability-in-zeromq-with-mostly-pure-luck/blow-my-mind.gif)

> Wait a second, did I just find a security vulnerability in ZeroMQ? 🤯

I can’t believe that’s real because I have never won a lottery ticket. I thought I must have made a mistake there, so I set up a debugger to trace the code step by step and asked my co-worker to walk through the code with me. And yes, we confirmed it was a real stack overflow security vulnerability in the code I had just discovered.

## Patch and disclose

We quickly patched the bug internally and got permission from the employer to disclose the bug to the ZeroMQ community. I tried to find the GPG key of the ZeroMQ maintainers but could not find one, so I opened [an issue](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3558) in the GitHub repository and mentioned that I found a security bug and would like to contact the maintainers confidentially. After getting their contact info, I shared this finding with them. We discussed and decided to roll out the patch for a week before we disclose the reproducer. Very soon, the ZeroMQ maintainers created a patch and rolled out the new release to all major Linux distributions.

Seeing the open-source community move quickly to patch a security vulnerability like a clock was surreal. I am not a security engineer. I am just a software engineer with a decent understanding of software security. I have never looked for any open-source software specifically for security vulnerabilities. It was just pure luck that I was looking into the source code for that particular feature, as I needed to do my job. Regardless, I am proud of what I found, and it made the open-source project I love more secure. Reading the XZ backdoor saga reminds me of that and made me wonder what this means for the open-source community.

## As an open-source author

I have published a few open-source projects in the past, some of which have gained some traction. For example, [Embassy](https://github.com/envoy/Embassy) is an embedded HTTP server library written in Swfit, mainly for iOS UI testing and API mocking. I built it while working for [Envoy](https://envoy.com/) in 2016, and people still use it today. I have another pet project, [Avataaar Generator](https://getavataaars.com/) written in TypeScript with React, which became one of the most popular avatar generators on the internet. I later [open-sourced it](https://github.com/fangpenlin/avataaars-generator).

It is rather sad to see how the original XZ maintainer burned out and was pressed into that position by the attackers. I understand that the code you wrote was like your brainchild. You want to take care of it as best as you can. However, I also want to remind myself and other open-source authors that we all have our own limits. Here’s what I think.

### I owe you nothing

There are many reasons we love open-source and want to contribute to it. Be it self-promotion, or you just enjoy seeing other people find the software you built useful.

![Walter White from Breaking Bad saying: I liked it. I was good at it](/images/2024-04-07-how-i-discovered-a-9-point-8-critical-security-vulnerability-in-zeromq-with-mostly-pure-luck/i-like-it.gif)

Walter White from Breaking Bad saying: I liked it. I was good at it

But at the end of the day, we still have our own life outside of the internet. While I hate to say this because I care, most open-source work is voluntary, and I owe you nothing. I spent my time or my employer’s time working on it and making it free for everybody to use it. I am not obligated to the users’ demands. If anyone thinks they are entitled, I recommend listening to [this song](https://app.suno.ai/song/da6d4a83-1001-4694-8c28-648a6e8bad0a/) with the loop on and enjoying their day.

### Less is more, is this feature really needed?

As a software engineer, it almost seems like our job is just to add more lines of code. The more lines we added, the more productive we are. The more features our software is, the newer the version is, the better. But is it true?

I think removing code while keeping a sensible set of features and having the clear goal of software in mind is equally important as adding new code. As for open-source, I always ask myself why I should open-source the software I built. Take the Avataaars Generator pet project I had, and it was mostly only because I thought people might find a few tricks I used there interesting and could learn something from it. I had no intention of making it an evolving project. Therefore, when I see requests to upgrade the React version and rewrite it with hooks, I just ignore them.

![Cat at Dinner Table meme](/images/2024-04-07-how-i-discovered-a-9-point-8-critical-security-vulnerability-in-zeromq-with-mostly-pure-luck/cat-at-dinner-table.jpg)

Cat at Dinner Table meme

Sometimes, I see a new feature request come in. I always ask why this feature is needed. Is there a better way to do it instead? For example, I saw a [feature request](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black/issues/23) for adding a check argument like Python’s [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code format for my [beancount-black](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beancount-black) Beancount code formatter project. I can finish this feature in just 10 minutes or so, but instead, I asked the user why this is needed. It turned out the user wanted to use it in git’s pre-commit hook and abort the commit when the file changed. Actually, a tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is supported by beancount-black. After explaining, the user was happy with the pre-commit, and the issue was closed.

## Always be curious and read the code

Being curious is always a critical quality of a good software engineer. If we don’t keep asking questions, many issues, like the XZ backdoor or the ZeroMQ exploit, won’t be found in the open-source community. I always learned the most when I got down the rabbit hole.

![A rabbit kicking people into a hole](/images/2024-04-07-how-i-discovered-a-9-point-8-critical-security-vulnerability-in-zeromq-with-mostly-pure-luck/rabbit-hole.gif)

A rabbit kicking people into a hole

Reading source code is a great way to go down the rabbit hole and learn how the software works. As software engineers, we are extremely lucky. For other types of engineers, there are fewer open-sourced materials. Reading code is underrated, and many software engineers don’t understand how and why they should read it. Reading code is much harder than writing code because writing code translates your thoughts into code, and reading code is the opposite. There could be so many different intentions in my mind, and I have so many ways to write it. Without me saying it out loud, it’s hard to guess what’s in others’s minds.

Unfortunately, it’s funny that in the era of AI-assisted coding, writing code is easier than ever, but reading code is even harder because now we have to read code generated by AI. For example, [some opportunists use AI-generated text plus code and submit security vulnerability reports to try their luck](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/).

Surely, time is limited, and not all source code is worth reading, but there’s no shortcut. You can only learn what’s good and what’s bad by reading enough of the code. We should encourage people to read code. Maybe next time, if you ever wonder how open-source software works, you can try to read it and learn a few tricks from it.

## Valgrind, fuzz test, sandbox, and eBPF

Interestingly, the attacker did a few things while preparing for their backdoor:

* [“Fixed” Valgrind issues](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39866275)
* [Disabled ifunc in Google’s oss-fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/10667)
* [Disabled landlock](https://twitter.com/kdrag0n/status/1774087290215973116)

[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) seems to play an essential role as an obstacle for the attacker. As the attacker has been working hard with the Fedora maintainer to fix Valgrind issues, the engineer who found the backdoor also noticed some Valgrind issues. As far as I know, Valgrind is mostly used to detect memory access violations. I am curious why the backdoor cannot work in a memory-safe way, and it has to cause issues with Valgrind.

I guess they were using some operations for obfuscation purposes, which Valgrind treats as less memory-safe, which has caused violations there. Such as loading data into a memory section marked as data but executing them as code? I wonder if we can put more code under constant Valgrind testing, making it way harder for a backdoor like this in the future.

As for the fuzz tests, some claimed that the purpose of disabling ifunc in Google’s oss-fuzz tests was to avoid the fuzz tests detecting the backdoor. However, the project maintainer [claimed that it wouldn’t be able to detect the backdoor](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/10667#pullrequestreview-1518981986). If that’s the case, I guess the attacker just wants to be extra cautious and also gain some trust.

Disabling [landlock](https://landlock.io/) is more interesting because, as far as I know, the backdoor was injected into the sshd process with ifunc while the xz library loaded via systemd. Landlock is mostly for sandboxing file access. The remote code execution is supposed to be done by sshd instead of any standalone XZ process. Then, why disabling landlock is needed? I guess the attacker is clearing the obstacle for their following moves. They may not need it right now, but it could be for their future backdoor patch. It’s also possible that they prepared multiple paths for the backdoor to work but eventually didn’t choose it.

On the bright side of this backdoor saga, the attackers going the extra mile to disable them gave us a hint of what could be an obstacle for an attack like this in the future. I wonder how sandbox technologies such as [Seccomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp), landlock, and [App Armor](https://apparmor.net/) could play a role in stopping or at least making the attacks much more difficult in the future (probably not in the xz backdoor’s case). I am also interested in learning how new technology, such as [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/), can help us detect suspicious behavior like this much more quickly in the future.

## Economics of wild-caught exploits vs. farm-raised exploits

One interesting aspect of this event is to think about it from an economic perspective. We know one can sell an undisclosed critical security vulnerability for up to a few million dollars. Such as on [Zerodium](https://zerodium.com/):

![Zerodium price table for desktop/servers](/images/2024-04-07-how-i-discovered-a-9-point-8-critical-security-vulnerability-in-zeromq-with-mostly-pure-luck/zerodium-prices.png)

Zerodium price table for desktop/servers

Because these zero-day exploits are like wild-caught seafood, some are rare and hard to find, so the price is higher. But what if instead of buying them on the market or catching them in the ocean, we farm-raised them ourselves? That’s probably what the attackers were thinking.

It’s tough to estimate the worth of an exploit. It depends on who the buyer is and the exploit itself. I am not an expert in this area, but let’s assume there’s a zero-day exploit in sshd that can do exactly like the xz bug known to someone selling it for 1 million USD. The same 1 million USD can pay software engineers like Jia Tan to infiltrate the open-source community, gain trust, and bake backdoors in a few years. It seems like a good deal to the attackers as long as they have patience. However, only this time did they fail, and the whole investment in this project went down to nothing.

![The Joker from Dark Night move burns money and said: It's not about money. It's about sending a message.](/images/2024-04-07-how-i-discovered-a-9-point-8-critical-security-vulnerability-in-zeromq-with-mostly-pure-luck/joker-burns-money.gif)

The Joker from Dark Night move burns money and said: It's not about money. It's about sending a message.

Provides “farm-raised exploits” that are way cheaper than wild-caught organic exploits. There will only be more attempts like this. Actually, Jonathan Blow have already predicted this years ago:

## Final thoughts

Open-source is beautiful. It’s really hard to explain.

> Do you mean a bunch of nerds who don’t really know each other in real life but work like clocks to build the most sophisticated software in the world through the internet and make it free for people to use 🤯?

Here’s the visualization of Git development history.

Nowadays, open source is no longer just a hobby of computer nerds. Billions and billions of devices run open-source software. In the internet era, this is more true than ever:

> Knowledge is power

Unfortunately, when the stakes are high enough, bad actors will always try to take advantage of us. While the implications of bad actors like “Jia Tan” are scary, nobody wants to make participating in open-source communities like playing among us after all.

![Video game Among Us an impostor killed another player](/images/2024-04-07-how-i-discovered-a-9-point-8-critical-security-vulnerability-in-zeromq-with-mostly-pure-luck/among-us.gif)

Video game Among Us an impostor killed another player

We are all human beings. We all make mistakes, and nobody should take the blame for this event, probably except the bad actors. There’s no silver bullet to solve this problem. The more important thing is how the community moves forward as a whole and thinks about what we learn from this and what we can do to make it more difficult. As long as there’s a benefit to gain, bad actors will always try to pull it.

The above is my story of finding a security bug in ZeroMQ and the two cents about the xz saga. What do you think we should do to prevent this from happening again?

The following upstream releases fixes the issue and will be shortly available:  <https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.2> <https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq4-x/releases/tag/v4.0.9> <https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq4-1/releases/tag/v4.1.7>  Individual backported patches can be found on the upstream bug tracker, and have been sent separately to the security teams of various distributions:  <https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3558>  The programs to reproduce the issue will be shared on the 15th of July.  --  Kind regards, Luca Boccassi ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1140255#c15)  Marcus Meissner   2019-07-09 05:56:19 UTC  ``` Note:  SLE12 and older do not build in CURVE support (due to missing libsodium buildrequirement) and so are not affected.  SLE15 and openSUSE LEap 15 build with stack protection features, which *likely* mitigates the direct impact down to a controlled abort. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1140255#c16)  Hans van den Heuvel   2019-07-09 08:11:24 UTC  ``` <https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7023929> ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1140255#c18)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-07-09 13:12:00 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:1785-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 28 Feature Freeze Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [glibc 2.27](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC227 "Changes/GLIBC227")
* [gcc 8.0](/wiki/Changes/GCC8 "Changes/GCC8")
* [Hardening Flags](/wiki/Changes/HardeningFlags28 "Changes/HardeningFlags28")
* [Mingw and MiniDebugInfo](/wiki/Changes/MingwMiniDebugInfo "Changes/MingwMiniDebugInfo")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Tuesday, February 6th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Bodhi Enablement Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f28
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f28. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f28 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f28
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

* [Packages that need to be rebuilt](https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f28-need-rebuild.html)
* [(F28FTBFS) Fedora 28 Mass Rebuild FTBFS Tracker](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1555378)

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a rpm build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2018-02-06 01:20:06.000000 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f28-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f28 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

Subject: CVE-2019-13132: zeromq/libzmq: denial of service via stack overflow
 with arbitrary data

Hello,

A security vulnerability has been reported in libzmq/zeromq.

CVE-2019-13132: a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a
libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE
encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and
overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in
the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration
are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no
known mitigations. All versions from 4.0.0 and upwards are affected.

Thank you Fang-Pen Lin for finding the issue and reporting it!

The following upstream releases fixes the issue and will be shortly
available:

<https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.2>
<https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq4-x/releases/tag/v4.0.9>
<https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq4-1/releases/tag/v4.1.7>

Individual backported patches can be found on the upstream bug tracker,
and have been sent separately to the security teams of various
distributions:

<https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3558>

The programs to reproduce the issue will be shared on the 15th of July.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1727055#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-04 10:26:30 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was discovered in ZeroMQ through 4.0.0 onwards which allows any unauthenticated client to cause a stack overflow on any server that is supposed to be protected by encryption/authentication. Arbitrary data sent by the client will overwrite the stack, so although the reporter didn't provide a specific exploit, it is entirely possible that a crafty attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability to do more than "just" crash the server.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1727055#c10)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-15 04:27:58 UTC  ``` Created zeromq tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1729830](show_bug.cgi?id=1729830 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-13132 zeromq: stack-overflow on any server protected by encryption/authentication [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1727055#c11)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-15 04:28:21 UTC  ``` Created zeromq tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1729831](show_bug.cgi?id=1729831 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-13132 zeromq: stack-overflow on any server protected by encryption/authentication [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1727055#c12)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-15 04:34:15 UTC  ``` Reference: <https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3558>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1727055#c13)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-15 04:39:07 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/07/08/6>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1727055#c14)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-15 05:07:58 UTC  ``` Created zeromq tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1729832](show_bug.cgi?id=1729832 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-13132 zeromq: stack-overflow on any server protected by encryption/authentication [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1727055#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-15 08:40:40 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Package        : zeromq3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13132

Fang-Pen Lin discovered a stack-based buffer-overflow flaw in ZeroMQ, a
lightweight messaging kernel library. A remote, unauthenticated client
connecting to an application using the libzmq library, running with a
socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.2.1-4+deb9u2.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.1-4+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zeromq3 packages.

For the detailed security status of zeromq3 please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zeromq3>

## Welcome

The ZeroMQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends the
standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by
specialised messaging middleware products. ZeroMQ sockets provide an
abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns,
message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport
protocols and more.

## Supported platforms

Libzmq is mainly written in C++98 with some optional C++11-fragments. For
configuration either autotools or CMake is employed. See below for some lists
of platforms, where libzmq has been successfully compiled on.

### Supported platforms with primary CI

For more details, see [here](/zeromq/libzmq/blob/master/SupportedPlatforms.md).

For some platforms (Linux, Mac OS X), [prebuilt binary packages are supplied by the ZeroMQ organization](#installation).
For other platforms, you need to [build your own binaries](#build).

## Installation of binary packages

### Linux

For Linux users, pre-built binary packages are available for most distributions.
Note that DRAFT APIs can change at any time without warning, pick a STABLE build to
avoid having them enabled.

arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/zeromq** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3.2** |

### Background

Looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency
framework.

Package        : zeromq3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13132

Fang-Pen Lin discovered a stack-based buffer-overflow flaw in ZeroMQ, a
lightweight messaging kernel library. A remote, unauthenticated client
connecting to an application using the libzmq library, running with a
socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.2.1-4+deb9u2.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.1-4+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zeromq3 packages.

For the detailed security status of zeromq3 please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zeromq3>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Description

In ZeroMQ libzmq before 4.0.9, 4.1.x before 4.1.7, and 4.2.x before 4.3.2, a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no known mitigations.
