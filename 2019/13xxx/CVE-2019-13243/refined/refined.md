The provided content is related to CVE-2019-13243.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is triggered by a user-mode write access violation at address `image00400000+0x00000000000249c6` during the processing of a malformed PCX image file. Specifically, the instruction `mov byte ptr [esi], al` at the given address attempts to write to memory pointed to by the `esi` register, which is `0af7b000`, resulting in an access violation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled write to an arbitrary memory location based on the contents of a specially crafted PCX file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The user-mode write access violation is classified as "EXPLOITABLE". It can lead to arbitrary code execution by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malformed PCX image file. This file would need to be opened by a vulnerable version of IrfanView.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide the specially crafted PCX file to the user of IrfanView. User interaction is required for exploitation, such as opening the malicious PCX file.
