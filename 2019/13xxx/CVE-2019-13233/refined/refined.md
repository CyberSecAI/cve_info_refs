  "CVE-2019-13233": {
    "description": "In arch/x86/lib/insn-eval.c in the Linux kernel before 5.1.9, there is a use-after-free for access to an LDT entry because of a race condition between modify_ldt() and a #BR exception for an MPX bounds violation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability in the arch/x86/lib/insn-eval.c function in the Linux kernel. A race condition between modify_ldt() and a #BR exception for an MPX bounds violation, leading to use-after-free for an LDT entry."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local access to trigger the race condition."
    ],
     "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability stems from the get_desc() function, which computes a pointer into the LDT while holding a lock, but then returns the potentially dangling pointer to its caller after dropping the lock.",
      "The fix involves providing the caller with a copy of the LDT entry instead of a pointer.",
       "The vulnerability can be exposed by an xfsprogs update that can test it"
