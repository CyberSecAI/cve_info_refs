  "cve": "CVE-2019-13227",
  "description": "deepin-clone before 1.1.3 creates a log file at the fixed path /tmp/.deepin-clone.log as root and follows symlinks there. An unprivileged user can prepare a symlink attack to create or overwrite files in arbitrary file system locations. The content is not attacker controlled.",
  "affected_component": "deepin-clone",
  "root_cause": "The application creates a log file at a predictable path (/tmp/.deepin-clone.log) and follows symlinks when writing to it.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Symlink following vulnerability"
  ],
  "impact": "A local attacker can create a symlink at /tmp/.deepin-clone.log that points to an arbitrary location in the filesystem. When the deepin-clone application writes to the log file, it will instead write to the target of the symlink, potentially overwriting or creating files in arbitrary locations.",
  "attack_vector": "Local",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An unprivileged local user can create symlinks.",
    "fix_commit": "https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-clone/commit/e079f3e2712b4f8c28e3e63e71ba1a1f90fce1ab",
    "fixed_version": "1.1.3",
    "additional_details": "The log file location was changed from /tmp/.deepin-clone.log to /var/log/deepin-clone.log, mitigating the symlink attack vulnerability."
