Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-13343

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a path traversal flaw in the Butor Portal's `WhiteLabelingServlet`. The servlet uses a "theme" parameter (`t`) from the query string to construct a file path for serving static files. This parameter is not properly sanitized.
*  **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The lack of sanitization on the "theme" parameter allows an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) and access files outside the intended theme directory, leading to arbitrary file download.
    *   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning an attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit it.
    *   **Unrestricted File Access:** Any file accessible to the user account under which the Butor Portal web service is running can be downloaded.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can download sensitive files, such as configuration files containing database and LDAP credentials, potentially leading to full compromise of the application and underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Server Compromise:** Accessing system files through path traversal could reveal critical system information like process information, memory maps, network information, application code, and more. This allows for further attacks.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Network information gathered can be used to pivot to other systems.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a manipulated "theme" parameter in the URL query string.
    *   **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerable parameter "t" is used to traverse file paths.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Butor Portal application.
    *   **No Authentication:** No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and URL parameters to craft the malicious request.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `com.butor.portal.web.servlet.WhiteLabelingServlet.java` specifically within the `service()` method.
*   The code constructs a file path using a theme parameter (`t`) concatenated with the file name (`h`), but the `t` parameter is not sanitized.
*   The `extractFilename` method is only sanitizing the filename parameter `h`, not the theme `t` parameter.
*   The `service` method uses the constructed path to locate a static file and echo the file content in the response.
*   The attacker can use a combination of brute-force and knowledge of common file locations/configurations to retrieve targeted files. The blog post details a number of useful paths and approaches including utilizing the `/proc` virtual file system.
