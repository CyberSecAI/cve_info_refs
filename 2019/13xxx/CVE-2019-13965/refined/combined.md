  is created/updated from an email.“
* Regression introduced in iTop 2.4 : Unable to
  notify when a template was used with a linkset
  ($this→functionalcis\_list$).
* Fix regression in 2.4.0 where GET\_LOCK is called
  with a name length greater than 64 characters on MySQL >
  5.7.5.
* Fixed “Notice: undefined index 0” in the portal.
  UserRequest/Incident::ComputePriority() was failing when attributes
  impact was still undefined.
#### Backup

  feature.
* The disk space necessary to create a backup is now

* Display stimulus codes in the Datamodel page

  AttributeCaseLog
#### CSV import

* Images and File documents can now be exported using

  required) where to download the actual image/document).
* CSV import of documents and images via URLs is
  supported (including URLs pointing to iTop itself). Administrators
  can also provide directly the path to a local file on the
  server.“
* CSV Import now supports friendlynames as
  reconciliation keys.
* Enable CSV import of request template fields
* Fix: Ticket from emails: duplicated dictionary
  entries which was an issue on CSV import.
#### Notification

* Email notification: new placeholder to provide the
  current user name in the body of the email, so the person who is
  triggering the notification who may not be the agent nor the
  caller.
* Fix Notification: Date & time format is now applied
  when using a date(time) attribute in a placeholder (eg.
  Notifications). Note: $this→raw(attcode)$ can be used to display
  value in SQL format like before.
#### Conf & Setup

* New configuration parameter 'allow\_menu\_on\_linkset'
  (boolean, default value false) to display actions in linkset in
  view mode (new, modify, delete, …).
* Setup: After a succesfull Setup, XML files are
  stored under /data with the complete view of the datamodel with and
  without delta.
* Setup: Store user selection on setup, so AboutBox
  is much clearer for users, providing User selection instead of
  cryptic module names.
* Setup: supports now changes of Configuration
  parameter: config db\_charset.
* Setup: New hook available after data load
  (ModuleInstaller::AfterDataLoad())
#### Backup

* Backup: Backup files could not exceed 4Gb
  (technology limitation). The fix consists in archiving the backup
  as a tar.gz instead of a zip. As a consequence, installing iTop now
  requires TWO additional PHP modules: phar/zlib. The zip module
  remains mandatory because it is used in other places. The restore
  utility accepts both legacy zip files and brand new tar.gz files.
  DBBackup::CreateZip is deprecated in favor of
  DBBackup::CreateCompressedBackup. DBRestore::RestoreFromZip is
  deprecated in favor of DBRestore::RestoreFromCompressedFile (which
  autodetects the format for backward compatibility).
* Backup: Allow database write access during a backup
  (can still be slow).
#### Performances

* Support of PHP7, which divides by two the load on
  the web server
* Internal emulation of apc(u), to divide by 5 the
  load on the web server (varies a lot, depending on the page, and
  cache hit ratio)
#### DataSynchro

* DataSynchro: Enable bulk deletion of Data Synchro
  Replica
* DataSynchro: Creation and edition was broken due to
  the new object set API from ormLinkSet.
  Backward compatible method have been introduce to ensure plugins
  and modules compatibility. That being said they are already flagged
  as deprecated and should not be used. New: Using those deprecated
  methods will raise a PHP deprecated error.
#### Internal

* Security: Portal OpenSans font embedded in iTop
  instead of fetching from google servers.

* Rework on ormLinkSet BC with DBObjectSet. PHP
  notice are not thrown anymore, see PHPDoc instead.
  GetColumnAsArray() introduced.
* Portal: Refactoring of const DEFAULT\_COUNT\_PER\_PAGE
  in several modules
* Reentrance issue on cmdbAbstractObject when coming
  from an extension implementing iApplicationObjectExtension.
* Added an index to prevent a slow down when a lot of
  tickets have been validated by the mean of an approval
  process
* Designer Connector has been revamped to avoid MTP
  temporary errors, diseappearing at the following Setup.

  with the message “cannot redeclare class XXXXXXX\_0” when loading
  some extensions modules.
* Fix: PHP Warning on not initialized variable
  $sHTMLValue in cmdbAbstractObject::GetFormElementForField().
#### Developpers

* The main menu “Helpdesk” could not be moved
  upward/downward by the mean of an XML delta (designer)
* Internal: LoginWebPage title defaultvalue is now a
  dictionary entry ('UI:Login:Title')
* Limitation: an a class having too many external
  keys, the update query fails with message “too many tables”
* Cleaned up old datamodel (1.x) as it was no longer
  maintained and could not be upgraded.
* Show product name on branding logo title instead of
  a generic “iTop” text.
#### Portal possibilities

  user menu.

  BrowseBrick.

* Portal: ExternalField support in forms has been
  improved. For example, email and url links were not displayed as
  proper HTML.

  forms submit, fixing issue where a portal user could unwillingly
  change the UserRequest status if a Support Agent had assign the
  ticket while the portal user was editing.
* Portal: New filter brick that pre-filters a Browse
  or Manage brick results from the home page.
* Portal: Linkset widget opening was throwing a
  warning message on IE9.
* Portal: ExternalField support in forms has been
  improved. For example, email and url links were not displayed as
  proper HTML.
* Portal: Option to display LinkedSet as opened in a
  form
* Portal: Picture/Preferences/Password forms can now
  be disabled in the user profile
* Portal: Notification URLs poiting to a portal were
  not working when several portal instances were configured.
* Portal: Tabs in ManageBrick display the objects
  count.
* Portal: Autocomplete fields were not showing all
  items when result count was below autocomplete display limit (eg.
  Showing only 2 elements out of 18 when display limit set to
  20)
* Portal: Added UI extension APIs similar to those
  used in the console (Experimental!)
* Portal: ManageBrick tabs could show objects that
  were not supposed to be shown due to a bad OQL
  interpretation.
* Portal: Display / download of blob attributes and
  attachments in the portal was not compatible with portal
  configuration and silos by-passing.
#### Console User Interface

* Improve UI in object details in the console.
* CKEditor: edition of HTML source code is now
  available. Filtering on allowed tags by CKEditor himself then by
  iTop for security reasons will still apply.

  modify, delete, …).

  too long.
* Fixed UI in console edit forms that were going over
  their container sometimes.
* Added scrollbars to modal dialog for CSV
  export.
* Fix Stop displaying Ticket objects in a CI's
  ongoing tickets tab when the impact code is 'not impacted'.
* Fix: Edition of an object with an ExternalKey on an
  object that the user is not allowed to see
* Fix: concurrent access on n:n relationships when
  edited from both end of the relation or when edited from portal and
  console in parallel.
* Fix: Date format handling in LinkedSetIndirect was
  causing fatal error on object edition.
* Fix: Edition of an object with not allowed (silos)
  remote objects in a linkedset causes fatal error.
