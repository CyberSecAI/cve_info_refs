  "CVE-2019-13574": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "A remote shell execution vulnerability exists in the ruby-mini-magick library. This vulnerability is exploitable when using `MiniMagick::Image.open` with specially crafted URLs coming from unsanitized user input.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `Kernel#open` method in Ruby accepts a string in the format `| <shell command>`, which executes the specified shell command. The `open-uri` standard library overrides `Kernel#open` to also accept URLs, which then delegates to `URI#open`. The `MiniMagick::Image.open` method used `Kernel#open` to open files and URLs, leading to the vulnerability when processing URLs from untrusted sources.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote shell execution"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server by providing a malicious URL.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by passing a specially crafted URL string to the `MiniMagick::Image.open` method.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the URL that is passed to the `MiniMagick::Image.open` method. This could be through a web application, an API, or another interface that accepts user input and uses the vulnerable library to process URLs."
