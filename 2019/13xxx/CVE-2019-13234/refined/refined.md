The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in OpenCMS versions 10.5.4 and 10.5.5, including XSS and LFI.  Specifically, it mentions CVE-2019-13234 as relating to reflected XSS in the search engine of the Alkacon OpenCms Apollo Template.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2019-13234:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the search engine functionality.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the search query. When a user visits the crafted link, the script will execute in the user's browser, allowing the attacker to potentially steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes a malicious JavaScript payload within the `q` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it.

**Technical Details:**
