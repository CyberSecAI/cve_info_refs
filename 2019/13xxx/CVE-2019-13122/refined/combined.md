Patchwork is a web-based patch tracking system designed to
facilitate the contribution and management of contributions to an
open-source project.

Patches that have been sent to a mailing list are 'caught' by the
system, and appear on a web page. Any comments posted that reference
the patch are appended to the patch page too.

The project's maintainer can then scan through the list of patches,
marking each with a certain state, such as Accepted, Rejected or Under
Review. Old patches can be sent to the archive or deleted.

Read more at the [Patchwork documentation site](https://patchwork.readthedocs.io/)

## download

The latest version of Patchwork is available with [git](http://git.or.cz/). To download:

```

[jk@pingu ~]$ git clone git://github.com/getpatchwork/patchwork

```

## patchwork design

### patchwork should supplement mailing lists, not replace them

Patchwork isn't intended to replace a community mailing list; that's
why you can't comment on a patch in patchwork. If this were the case,
then there would be two forums of discussion on patches, which
fragments the patch review process. Developers who don't use patchwork
would get left out of the discussion.

However, a future development item for patchwork is to facilitate
on-list commenting, by providing a "send a reply to the list"
feature for logged-in users.

### don't pollute the project's changelogs with patchwork poop

A project's changelogs are valuable - we don't want to add patchwork-specific
metadata.

### patchwork users shouldn't require a specific version control system

Not everyone uses git for kernel development, and not everyone uses
git for patchwork-tracked projects.

It's still possible to hook other programs into patchwork, using the
`pwclient` command-line client for patchwork, or directly to
the XML RPC interface.

## mailing list

There is now a [patchwork mailing
list](https://lists.ozlabs.org/mailman/listinfo/patchwork). Sign up for updates to patchwork.

# [PATCH 0/2] XSS in Patchwork - CVE-2019-13122

* Previous message (by thread): [[PATCH] about: Display admin contact details](005882.html)

```
Andrew Donnellan discovered an XSS via the message-id field. A
malicious user could send a patch with a message ID that included a
script tag. Because of the quirks of the email RFCs, such a message ID
can survive being sent through many mail systems, including Gmail, and
be parsed and stored by Patchwork. When a user views a patch detail
page for the patch with this message id, the script would be run.

This is due to an erroneous mark_safe() in the template tag that
renders message IDs. This has been present since v1.1 of upstream
Patchwork, but does not affect the FreeDesktop fork. The bug is fixed
in patch 1. If you run a patchwork instance, you should apply it
immediately. There is also a test patch, patch 2, that you may find
helpful.

Over the last few days we have disclosed this bug to the admins of
patchwork instances that we could identify. We were hoping to give
people running instances a few more days but the embargo was
accidentally broken early, so we're letting you all know now.

I have already applied these patches to the git repository. I have
also backported the patches to 2.1 and 2.0, pushed them, and will do a
new release of both shortly.

Kind regards,
Daniel

Message-ID: <8736jl0z7b.fsf@dja-thinkpad.axtens.net>
Date: Fri, 05 Jul 2019 16:31:36 +1000
From: Daniel Axtens <dja@...ens.net>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Cc: Andrew Donnellan <ajd@...ux.ibm.com>
Subject: CVE-2019-13122: Patchwork: XSS via Message-ID

Hello,

Patchwork is a web-based patch tracking system designed to facilitate
the contribution and management of contributions to an open-source
project that uses a mailing list for contributions.
(<http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/>)

Andrew Donnellan discovered an XSS via the message-id field. A malicious
party could send a patch with a message ID that included a script
tag. Because of the quirks of the email RFCs, such a message ID can
survive being sent through many mail systems, including Gmail, and be
parsed and stored by Patchwork. When a user views a patch detail page
for the patch with this message id, the script would be run.

This is due to an erroneous mark_safe() in the template tag that
renders message IDs. This has been present since v1.1 of upstream
Patchwork, but does not affect the FreeDesktop fork.

Over the last few days, we have disclosed this bug to the admins of
patchwork instances that we could identify. Several key instances have
already been patched.

The vulnerability is fixed in Patchwork v2.1.4 and v2.0.4, which have
just been released.

Kind regards,
Daniel Axtens
Patchwork maintainer
