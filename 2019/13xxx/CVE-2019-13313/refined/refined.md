        "CVE": "CVE-2019-13313",
        "content": "The provided content reveals a vulnerability in libosinfo's `osinfo-install-script` option, which allows user and admin passwords to be leaked via command-line arguments. This vulnerability is identified as CVE-2019-13313. This utility generates scripts for automated guest installations, but the exposure of passwords in process listings is a major security flaw. \n\nRoot cause: The root cause of this vulnerability is the insecure passing of passwords as command-line arguments to the `osinfo-install-script` utility.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the way the `osinfo-install-script` utility handles sensitive data (passwords). Instead of using a more secure method for providing authentication, it takes passwords directly as command-line parameters, making them visible to other users on the system. \n\nImpact of exploitation: The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that local users can potentially discover user and admin passwords of virtual machines. This compromises the security of the virtualized environment, potentially allowing unauthorized access or control.\n\nAttack vectors: The primary attack vector is through local access to the system where the `osinfo-install-script` command is executed. An attacker who has local access can list the running processes, and if the vulnerable command is running, they can easily find the passwords.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to have local access to the system where the `osinfo-install-script` command is being run. No elevated privileges are explicitly required, as any user with the ability to list processes will be able to see the command and the exposed passwords.",
         "additional_details": "The content also specifies that a security fix for CVE-2019-13313 has been included in various Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux updates. It is mentioned in Red Hat Bugzilla entries, Fedora mailing list announcements, and Red Hat Security Advisories."
