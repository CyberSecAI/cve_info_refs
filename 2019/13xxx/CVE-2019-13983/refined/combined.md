# Feature Request

About audited Directus version.

It has been cloned from suite repo.

Latest commit [directus/directus@1d151a9](https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/1d151a9034514e3f2ec1c80001e7c5fffdef2d4e)

## Description:

Insufficient Anti-automation occurs when a web application permits an attacker to automate a process that was originally designed to be performed only in a manual fashion, i.e. by a human web user.

## Business risk:

Once exploited, attackers can use an automatic tool or a simple script that performs a brute-force authentication attempts, and possible cause a legitimate user lock out.

## Technical details:

The login mechanism of the application does not prevent a brute-force on login attempts and on change password function.

## What problem does this feature solve?

Fixes security hole.

## How do you think this should be implemented?

* Implement an anti-automation mechanism such as CAPTCHA

  Note: do not use account locking, because of the ability to perform a DoS on user accounts.
* Complementary instructions for protecting brute-forcing on users can be found in the following URL:

  <http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246938/Insufficient%20Anti-automation>

  <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks>

## Would you be willing to work on this?

Maybe, with help/guidance from Directus team.
