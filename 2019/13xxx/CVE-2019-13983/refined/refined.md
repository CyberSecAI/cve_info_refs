Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability described in the issue:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application lacks sufficient anti-automation measures, specifically during login and password change processes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Anti-Automation:** The core vulnerability is the absence of mechanisms to prevent automated processes, such as brute-force attacks, on login and password change features.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Brute-force Authentication:** Attackers can automate login attempts to guess user credentials.
*   **User Account Lockout:** While not explicitly recommended, the document notes that a consequence of brute-force could be legitimate user account lockouts.
*   **Possible DoS:** The document also notes that the ability to lock out user accounts due to excessive failed login attempts could be used to perform a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Automated scripts or tools:** Attackers can employ scripts or tools to automatically submit multiple login attempts or password change requests.
*   **Web application's login and password change forms:** The attack targets these forms through automated interaction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the application over the network.
*   **Basic scripting or tool usage knowledge:**  The attacker must be able to use automated scripts or tools to execute the brute-force attack.

**Additional notes**
*   The document specifically mentions that the login mechanism on the application does not prevent brute force attacks.
*   The suggested fixes are to implement an anti-automation mechanism such as CAPTCHA, and avoid using account locking as a mitigation due to the potential for DoS.
