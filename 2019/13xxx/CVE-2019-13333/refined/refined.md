- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the conversion of DXF files to PDF, leading to a write past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**:  Opening a malicious DXF file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the conversion process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious DXF file or a webpage that triggers the vulnerable conversion process. The user must interact with the malicious content (open the file or visit the page).
