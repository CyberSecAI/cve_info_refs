{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Ovidentia CMS application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in various fields across multiple functionalities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the victim's browser, allowing for session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST requests to multiple endpoints (e.g., creating groups, mail domains, sites, notes, FAQs)",
      "HTTP GET requests with malicious parameters"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints and inject malicious JavaScript code into parameters accepted by the application. No authentication is required for some attack vectors, but in others like the stored XSS ones, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. Also, access to the application is required. For the reflected XSS vulnerability, no prior knowledge of the system is necessary.",
    "description": "The provided exploit targets various functionalities of the Ovidentia CMS, version 8.4.3 up to 8.6.4. The vulnerability allows for different forms of XSS attacks: stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS. The exploit demonstrates several attack vectors involving different parameters and functionalities, such as creating groups, mail domains, sites, notes, FAQs, and a document add functionality. The exploit provides specific examples of POST and GET requests for both stored and reflected XSS attacks."
