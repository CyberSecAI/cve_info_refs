# Command Injection on Palo Alto Networks Expedition

### XML External Entity Injection (XXE) in OpenCats Applicant Tracking System](https://doddsecurity.com/312/xml-external-entity-injection-xxe-in-opencats-applicant-tracking-system/)

Name: [Palo Alto Networks Expedition (Migration Tool)](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Expedition-Migration-Tool/ct-p/migration_tool)

Vendor: Palo Alto Networks

Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Command Injection

Vendor Advisory: [Palo Alto Networks Advisory](https://securityadvisories.paloaltonetworks.com/Home/Detail/138)

Affected Versions: Versions before 1.0.108

CVE ID: CVE-2018-10143

Expedition (Migration Tool) is provided by Palo Alto Networks to assist with moving firewall configurations from another vendor to Palo Alto’s product. It makes the conversion process easier to accomplish. The virtual appliance can be downloaded [here](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Expedition-Migration-Tool/ct-p/migration_tool).

Any unauthenticated user on the network could execute remote commands on the Expedition Tool under the context of the web-server user.

The command injection exists within a file named convertCSVtoParquet.php in the user-controlled POST parameter named “path”.

For command injection to work within the “path” parameter, the string that contains the injected command(s) must look similar to this format:

```
1:2:/tmp/log && COMMAND_INJECTION_HERE
```

Replace COMMAND\_INJECTION\_HERE with any command or chain of commands.

---

#### Proof of Concept

I am running a command that lists the current directory and piping the ouput to a netcat listener.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/expedition5.png)

#### The Exploit

I wrote a quick exploit that exploits the vulnerability. I am executing a base64 encoded bash reverse shell in the image below.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/expedition_exploit1.png)

I received a shell and ran the “hostname” command.

---

#### Timeline

Before I post the timeline, I just wanted to say that it is always great to see security teams that swiftly respond and patch vulnerabilities after disclosures. It was good to see Palo Alto Networks PSIRT team’s response, and they kept me in the loop!

* November 29, 2018 – I disclosed to the vendor.
* November 30, 2018 – The vendor confirmed the vulnerability.
* December 5, 2018 – The vendor said this was fixed in version 1.0.108.
* December 11, 2018 – The vendor posted their [security advisory](https://securityadvisories.paloaltonetworks.com/Home/Detail/138) on their website and assigned a CVE.
* December 12, 2018 – Published (this post).

# 0.9.7 Security update

[January 2023](/news/2023/jan/)
## Security release and vulnerability news

After a detailed security audit, we have released OpenCATS version 0.9.7 which detected and corrected several vulnerabilities.

### Overview

[@hansmach1ne](https://github.com/hansmach1ne) identified a number of vulnerabilities on the ‘internal’ webpages and would require a valid username/password to reach. It’s been greatly appreciated by the project that these vulnerabilities were checked and mitigating PR’s proposed.

I’m very appreciative of the work that they’ve put in here and once the release is produced will share it on the project website.

Mitigation steps - I’d always recommend users / admins read the security guidelines and think carefully for themselves https://github.com/opencats/OpenCATS/wiki/Security-Considerations which actually include mention of some of these ‘internal facing’ vulnerabilities

### Remediation

We recommend that you upgrade your opencats instance asap.

If you wish to apply a fix instead, please view the changes in the github PR instead.

### Thanks

We are extremely grateful to [@hansmach1ne](https://github.com/hansmach1ne) for finding these vulnerability and proposing remediation steps.

[Vendor’s Vulnerability Announcement](http://www.opencats.org/news/2019/july/)

CVE-2019-13358

Internet Facing OpenCats: [Google Dork](https://www.google.com/search?q=intitle:"opencats+-+Login"+OR+intitle:"CATS+-+Login")

[OpenCats](http://www.opencats.org/) is an open-sourced applicant tracking system that is used to track job applicants. Versions before 0.9.4-3 suffer from a XML External Entity Injection vulnerability that allows unauthenticated job applicants to read arbitrary files after uploading a resume with a docx or odt file extension.

#### Vulnerability Walk through

Opencats has a Careers Portal page that lists jobs for applicants to view and apply for any available jobs.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats1.png)

Careers Portal

For this demonstration, I have created a position titled “Pen Tester”. After clicking on the position, I have the option to import a resume which will convert a resume to text. The text will make the contents of a resume searchable by the recruiter or hiring manager after applying for a position.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats2.png)

The “Import a Resume” feature

This feature can be exploited with a .docx or .odt file. I will use a .docx file for this blog post. Create a docx file with your favorite document editor, Google Docs, or use Python.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats3.png)

Google Docs: This is a very short resume with only my name in it. Go to “File > Download as > Microsoft Word (.docx)”.

Also, you can create a docx file with this simple python script. I know this is basic stuff, but I’m just providing a few different options.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats4.png)

This python script will create a properly formatted docx file.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats5.png)

After running the script, resume.docx was created.

At this point, our docx file is not malicious and if it were to be uploaded, it would just show my name since that is the only text in my very simple resume (if you can even call it that).

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats7.png)

After uploading resume.docx, it shows my name as the only text that was found.

A Docx file is mostly just zipped up xml files. We need to unzip the resume.docx file and modify the contents in “word/document.xml”. Then, save our changes back to resume.docx.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats6.png)

The file is unzipped and the “word/document.xml” that needs to be modified is highlighted.

Two modifications are needed in document.xml. For the first modification, add this line under line one to read /etc/passwd:

```
<!DOCTYPE test [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]>
```
![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats8.png)

Adding the XXE payload to read /etc/passwd.

For the second modification, we need to find and change my name which was the only content that was in the resume. We will swap out my name with this:

```
&test;
```
![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats9-1.png)

My name was found on line three within some XML tags.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats10.png)

This is how the line looks after swapping out my name.

That’s it! The modifications to document.xml need to be saved to the resume.docx file now.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats11.png)

Saving changes to document.xml within the docx file.

Once the malicious .docx file is uploaded then the contents of /etc/passwd can be read.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats12.png)

Reading /etc/passwd on the operating system.

At this point, you can pillage the file system to find plaintext passwords and other interesting information that you could reuse elsewhere. To read the Opencats config.php file to recover plaintext passwords, you will need to base64 encode the contents.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats13.png)

Base64 encoding config.php that contains the database and other credentials. This change is saved to resume.docx.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats14.png)

The base64 encoded contents of config.php are returned.

![](https://doddsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/opencats15.png)

After decoding the base64 in Burp Suite, the config.php that contains various plain-text credentials can be viewed.
