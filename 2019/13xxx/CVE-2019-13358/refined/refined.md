Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw present in the OpenCATS Applicant Tracking System.
*   The vulnerability stems from how OpenCATS processes uploaded .docx and .odt files when converting them to text. These file formats are essentially zipped XML files. The application does not properly sanitize the XML data, allowing an attacker to insert malicious XML entities that can be used to read local files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The core weakness is the improper handling of XML data when processing uploaded documents. The application does not disable external entity processing, making it vulnerable to XXE attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server's file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Plaintext Credential Exposure:** By reading files like `config.php`, attackers can obtain database credentials and other sensitive information in plaintext. This can lead to further compromise of the application and potentially the entire server.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The attacker can potentially access any file accessible to the web server user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attack vector is the "Import a Resume" feature in the OpenCATS Careers Portal. An attacker uploads a specially crafted .docx or .odt file that contains the malicious XML payload.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users (job applicants).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Knowledge:** An attacker needs basic knowledge of XML and how to create a malicious .docx file with an XXE payload.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenCATS application and the ability to access the Careers Portal which is generally public.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have an existing user account in the system. The exploit occurs during the job application process.

**More Details than CVE:**

*   The provided content gives detailed steps on how to exploit the vulnerability, including how to create a malicious .docx file and how to use it to read arbitrary files. It provides code examples (Python) for creating the malicious docx and also provides examples of reading `/etc/passwd` as well as how to read and decode `config.php` which contains database credentials.
*   The content includes a detailed timeline of the disclosure process.
*   The content includes links to the vendor's announcement and security advisory.
