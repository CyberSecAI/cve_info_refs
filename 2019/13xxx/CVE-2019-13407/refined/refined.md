{
  "CVE-2019-13407": {
    "Root cause": "The web server responds with a path error message when a requested resource is not found in the cgibin/ssi.cgi page. This message does not properly escape user-controlled input, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper output sanitization/encoding"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can steal an administrator's cookie if the HttpOnly flag is not set.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a path that doesn't exist on the server. When a user accesses this URL, the server responds with the error message containing the malicious script, which then executes in the user's browser.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a crafted malicious link. No prior authentication is required."
