The provided content relates to CVE-2019-13488.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the usage of jQuery's `prepend()` method to embed user-controlled input into the admin interface without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Unsafe use of `prepend()` method in JavaScript.
- Lack of sanitization of user inputs before displaying it on the admin interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the admin interface, leading to actions such as:
- Stealing cookies
- Redirecting to malicious websites
- Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/register` endpoint with malicious JavaScript payloads in the `country`, `query`, and `refer` parameters.
- The injected JavaScript is stored in the application and executed when the administrator accesses the control panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/register` endpoint.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges as this is an unauthenticated endpoint.
