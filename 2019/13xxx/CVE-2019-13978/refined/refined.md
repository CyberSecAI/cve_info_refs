- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when processing requests to `/ovidentia/index.php?tg=delegat&idx=mem&id=1`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `id` parameter of the `/ovidentia/index.php` endpoint when `tg=delegat` and `idx=mem`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and possibly privilege escalation. The attacker can also potentially use time-based SQL injection to extract data or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/ovidentia/index.php` with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. Authentication is required as the exploit is described as "(Authenticated)". The attacker also needs to know or discover the vulnerable endpoint.
