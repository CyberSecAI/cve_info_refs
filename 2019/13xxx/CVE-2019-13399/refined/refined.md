The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2019-13399.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The FortiCam FCM-MB40 uses a hardcoded, preconfigured SSL/TLS certificate for its web administration interface. This certificate is deployed with the firmware and is not unique to each device, effectively meaning all devices of this model share the same certificate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded cryptographic key: The same SSL certificate and private key are used across all devices, instead of generating a unique one per device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks: Attackers can intercept and decrypt network traffic to/from the device if they are in a position to do so, such as on the same network or through network redirection.
- Traffic decryption: Anyone who gains access to the shared private key is able to decrypt historical or future captured SSL traffic.
- Exposure of credentials: Since the web interface's SSL traffic can be decrypted, admin credentials and any other information passed through the interface can be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: Attackers need to be on the same network as the camera or in a position to intercept its network traffic.
- Man-in-the-middle: An attacker can intercept communications and decrypt or modify them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network or have the ability to intercept the camera's network traffic.
- Access to the private key: Having access to the private key for the certificate allows decryption of traffic. This key is shared by all devices.

The content also provides additional details such as the certificate's issuer information and validity dates, and an example extracted from the device's configuration showing the usage of the certificate in the webserver configuration, along with a full base64 encoded version of the certificate. It also notes that the camera uses the Mbedthis Appweb web server and that the certificate is stored at `/etc/ssl/certificate.pem`.
