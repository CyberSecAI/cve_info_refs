Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-13364

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in Piwigo version 2.9.5, specifically in the `/admin.php?page=notification_by_mail&mode=param` and `/admin.php?page=account_billing` pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to neutralize or sanitize user-controlled input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web pages.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The forms on the vulnerable pages lack CSRF tokens, making them susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and persistently store malicious JavaScript code within the administrative configuration pages.
- Once injected, this code can be used to coerce an administrator into performing unintended actions, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts malicious HTML forms targeting the vulnerable administrative pages (`/admin.php?page=notification_by_mail&mode=param` and `/admin.php?page=account_billing`).
- These forms are hosted on an attacker-controlled server.
- The attacker tricks an administrator into visiting the malicious page, usually via social engineering (e.g. a phishing link).
- Upon visiting the page, the malicious form is submitted to the Piwigo application. Due to the lack of CSRF protection and improper input sanitization, the malicious JavaScript is injected and stored persistently.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to trick a Piwigo administrator into visiting the malicious site to submit the crafted form.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided HTML form examples demonstrate how the `nbm_send_html_mail`, `nbm_send_mail_as` and `billing_name` parameters can be injected with Javascript code.
- The vulnerability is described as 'minor' because it requires admin access and the forms are protected against CSRF attacks (this is likely incorrect since CSRF is listed as a vulnerability and the forms are described as not containing CSRF tokens)

**Additional Notes**
- The issue was fixed by Piwigo, first by adding CSRF protection, and then by fixing the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Tempest Security Intelligence.
