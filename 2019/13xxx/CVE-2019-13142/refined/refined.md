The content is related to CVE-2019-13142.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is insecure file and folder permissions for the Razer Surround software. Specifically, the service executable "RzSurroundVADStreamingService.exe" and its containing folder "C:\ProgramData\Razer\Synapse\Devices\Razer Surround\Driver" had insufficient access control, granting "FullControl" to "Everyone".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure file/folder permissions
- The service executable "RzSurroundVADStreamingService.exe" was located in a directory writable by low-privileged users.
- The "RzSurroundVADStreamingService" runs as SYSTEM

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege (EoP) to SYSTEM.
- An attacker can replace the legitimate service executable with a malicious one. Once the service restarts, the attacker's malicious executable runs with SYSTEM privileges, allowing for complete control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack vector
- The attacker needs to have access to the local system, specifically the ability to write to the vulnerable directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to write files to the file system in the vulnerable folder (C:\ProgramData\Razer\Synapse\Devices\Razer Surround\Driver)
- A low-privileged user account is sufficient.
