The provided content describes a vulnerability in TronLink Wallet version 2.2.0 for Android. It does not relate to the placeholder CVE-2019-13096.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The TronLink Wallet application stores user wallet keystore data in plaintext within an insecure location on the Android file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Storage:**  Wallet keystore data is stored in plaintext in `/data/data/com.tronlink.wallet/shared_prefs/.xml`. This directory is accessible to other applications with sufficient permissions.
- **Plaintext Storage:** The sensitive keystore information is not encrypted, making it easily readable if accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the keystore data can gain full control of the user's Tron wallet. This would allow them to:
    -  Transfer funds
    -  Access other sensitive information associated with the wallet
    - Impersonate the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious App:** A malicious application installed on the same Android device could potentially access the insecurely stored wallet data, if it has sufficient permissions
- **Physical Device Access:** If an attacker gains physical access to the device (rooted) they can read the contents of the shared_prefs directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to read the contents of `/data/data/com.tronlink.wallet/shared_prefs/.xml`, which requires:
    - On a non-rooted device, either a malicious app with the permissions to access the shared_prefs directory or a vulnerability to perform this access.
    - On a rooted device, the attacker must have root access.
