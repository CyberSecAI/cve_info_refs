{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `sbrk` function in ToaruOS does not handle address space wrapping correctly. Repeated calls to sbrk eventually wrap around the address space, leading to an overwrite of page frames which causes a critical error.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow/wraparound in address space handling within the `sbrk` implementation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS). The system will run out of usable memory due to overwritten page frames, leading to a critical error.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local execution of a crafted program.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must have the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system."
