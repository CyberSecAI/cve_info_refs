Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** User Mode Write Access Violation
*   **Root Cause:** The crash occurs due to an access violation while writing to memory at address `ecx`. The instruction `mov dword ptr [ecx],eax` attempts to write the value in `eax` to the memory location pointed to by `ecx`. In this case, `ecx` holds the address `0be05000`, which the application cannot write to, leading to the access violation.
*   **Weakness:** The application attempts to write to an invalid memory location.
*   **Impact:** The vulnerability is classified as "EXPLOITABLE". User mode write access violations are generally considered exploitable.
*   **Attack vector:** The provided information indicates the vulnerability was triggered by processing a specific file (`id_000096_00`). This suggests the attack vector involves supplying a malformed or crafted file that, when processed by XnView, leads to the memory corruption.
*   **Attacker capability:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted file to XnView.
*   **Affected version:** XnView Standard v2.48 (x86)
