Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13962:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer over-read in the `lavc_CopyPicture` function within `modules/codec/avcodec/video.c` of VLC media player.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The `lavc_CopyPicture` function doesn't properly validate the width and height parameters when copying a picture, resulting in a read beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of service (DoS):** A crafted media file could cause VLC to crash due to the buffer over-read.
- **Arbitrary code execution:**  It is possible that the heap-based buffer over-read can be developed into an arbitrary code execution exploit, although no specific exploitation details are included.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** As stated in the CVSS vector, the attack can be triggered over the network by enticing a user to open a malicious media file.
- **Local:** Some advisories note that the attack can be achieved locally via a malformed file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs to craft a malicious media file (e.g. .mp4, .ogg) that triggers the vulnerable code path in VLC.
- The attacker would require that the victim user opens this file with a vulnerable version of VLC.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects VLC media player versions up to and including 3.0.7.
- Several sources indicate that the fix involves updating to at least version 3.0.8, and in some cases specific versions like 3.0.7.1-bp150.2.6.1 or later.
- The vulnerability is present in the avcodec module, more precisely in how it handles picture copying.
- The vulnerability has been resolved in various Linux distributions through security patches and updates to vlc packages.
