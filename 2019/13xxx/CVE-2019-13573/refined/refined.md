{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of input data within the `getListPageData` function in the `db.php` file of the FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin. Specifically, the function does not properly sanitize the `$order_by` parameter, which is later used in a SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially craft a malicious SQL query by manipulating the `order_by` parameter when accessing the list of players, potentially leading to data exfiltration or modification.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the plugin's administrative interface, specifically when accessing the list of video players where the sort order can be controlled by the user.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have at least Editor-level access to the WordPress site's admin panel to exploit this vulnerability."
