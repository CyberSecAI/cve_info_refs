[slackware-security]  irssi (SSA:2019-180-01)

New irssi packages are available for Slackware 14.0, 14.1, 14.2, and -current
to fix a security issue.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/irssi-1.1.3-i586-1_slack14.2.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue: Use after free when sending SASL login
  to the server found by ilbelkyr. May affect the stability of Irssi. SASL
  logins may fail, especially during (manual and automated) reconnect.
  For more information, see:
    <https://irssi.org/2019/06/29/irssi-1.2.1-1.1.3-1.0.8-released/>

# Irssi 1.2.1 and 1.1.3 and 1.0.8 Released

Posted on June 29th 2019

Irssi 1.2.1 and 1.1.3 and 1.0.8 have been released! They contain some
critical updates which we hope you'll enjoy. There are no new
features. **All Irssi users should upgrade to this version**. See the
[NEWS](/NEWS/#news-v1-2-1) for details.

For more information refer to the [security
advisory](/security/html/irssi_sa_2019_06).

If you've had any issues with SASL login suddenly failing, hopefully
this update will fix that.

This release can be downloaded from [our releases page](/NEWS). Binary
test packages for various Linux distributions are automatically
generated by the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/)
and are available for download in the
[irssi-test](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-test;package=irssi)
and
[irssi-oldtest](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:ailin_nemui:irssi-oldtest;package=irssi)
repositories.

Please check with your distro whether they provide officially updated
packages.

We currently do not have any alternate advice.

The Irssi Team.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
