Based on the provided information, this document describes a user mode write access violation vulnerability in ACDSee Free version 1.1.21.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of a crafted BMP file, specifically during color profile setting. The crash occurs at `IDE_ACDStd!IEP_SetColorProfile+0xb9c2f`. The instruction causing the crash is `rep stos dword ptr es:[edi]`, indicating a write access violation due to an invalid or corrupted destination address `edi`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User mode write access violation at an address that is not near NULL. The application attempts to write to an invalid memory address when setting the color profile, causing the access violation. The provided crash dump includes corrupted JPEG data which might be linked to the cause of the write access violation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution because a user mode write access violation, not close to NULL, is considered exploitable.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted BMP image file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious BMP file to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required.
