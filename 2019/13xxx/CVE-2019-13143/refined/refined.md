{
  "CVE-2019-13143": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a combination of an information disclosure issue and poor token management within the FB50 smart lock mobile application.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "No SSL pinning used in the Android application",
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the user ID, exposing user data",
      "Ability to unbind a lock from an existing user and bind it to a new one using just the MAC address of the lock"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain complete control of the smart lock, unbinding it from the legitimate owner's account and binding it to the attacker's account, thereby gaining the ability to unlock the device.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out using the mobile application by exploiting a series of requests, starting with the device's MAC address.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Knowledge of the lock's MAC address",
       "Ability to capture and modify requests sent to the application server",
      "Ability to be within the Bluetooth range of the device to unlock it after taking control of it."
