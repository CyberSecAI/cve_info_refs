## Description

![@fcambus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825456?v=4&size=48)[fcambus](https://github.com/fcambus)opened [on Jun 28, 2019](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/nsd/issues/20#issue-462005202)

Hi,

While fuzzing nsd-checkzone with American Fuzzy Lop, I found a Stack-based Buffer Overflow in the dname\_concatenate() function, in dname.c L464.

Attaching a reproducer (gzipped so GitHub accepts it), issue can be reproduced by running:

nsd-checkzone all.rr zone02

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1727689#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-08 03:50:22 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1727689#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-08 03:50:24 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.
