Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of Java objects within the `X-MULE_SESSION` HTTP header in MuleSoft Runtime versions prior to 3.8. These versions utilize the vulnerable Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The MuleSoft Runtime deserializes arbitrary Java objects provided by the user in the `X-MULE_SESSION` header without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Vulnerable Component:**  The use of the vulnerable Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 library allows attackers to craft malicious payloads that can be executed upon deserialization.
*   **Pre-Authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable before authentication, meaning an attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable MuleSoft Runtime. This can lead to complete compromise of the system and potentially the entire network.
*   **System Takeover:** An attacker could use the RCE to gain full control of the server, install malware, steal sensitive data, disrupt services, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** Attackers inject malicious serialized Java objects into the `X-MULE_SESSION` header of an HTTP request to a vulnerable MuleSoft application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable MuleSoft server.
*   **Payload Generation:** The attacker needs the ability to generate a malicious Java object payload using tools like `ysoserial`.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
* The blog post confirms that although an HTTP 500 error response might be received, the payload has been successfully executed.
* The vulnerability is in the MuleSoft runtime itself, and not in applications built on the platform. This means any application deployed on a vulnerable runtime is susceptible.
* The fix is to upgrade to MuleSoft Runtime 3.8 or higher, which uses Apache Commons 3.2.2, which is not vulnerable to the same exploit chain.
