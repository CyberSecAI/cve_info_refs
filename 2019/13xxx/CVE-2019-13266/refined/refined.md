Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the fact that routers, designed to isolate logical networks (host and guest) through software, often share hardware resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This shared resource access, coupled with software implementation flaws, allows for the creation of covert channels where data can be leaked between the isolated networks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Direct Covert Channels:**
    *   **DHCP Direct:** Routers incorrectly forward DHCP NAK messages between networks, allowing data to be encoded in the Transaction ID field.
    *   **IGMP Direct:** Joining and leaving an IGMP group on one network causes an IGMP Membership Query to be sent to the other network, allowing data transfer in the Group IP field.
    *  **ARP Direct:** Some routers forward ARP requests between networks, allowing attackers to embed data in the IP address of ARP requests.

2.  **Timing Covert Channels:**
    *   **Shared Resource Contention:**  The router's control plane (software) becomes a shared resource for both networks. Activities on one network (e.g., initiating SSH, sending many ARP requests, loading router web pages) can increase the load on the router's CPU or buffers. This change in resource availability impacts the other network and can be measured.
    *   **Gadgets:** The research identifies specific 'gadgets' to exploit this contention:
        *   **SSH:** Initiating SSH key exchange on one network loads the router's CPU and slows down responses on the other network.
        *  **CSRF:** Loading the router's web interface via an iframe can cause increased CPU load on the router.
        *  **DHCP Timing:** Sending a DHCP request and timing the response reveals load on the router.
        *   **ARP Timing:** Sending ARP requests and measuring the response time is another method to gauge the load.
        *   **ICMP Timing:** Using ICMP echo requests (ping) to measure response times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Malicious implants on a guest network can leak sensitive data to the host network and then the Internet.
*   **Command and Control:** Attackers on the internet can send commands to an infected device on the host network through the guest network.
*   **Bypass Isolation:** The covert channels completely bypass the intended network isolation between the guest and host networks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Implants:** Attackers need a compromised device or code (e.g., malicious JavaScript) on one of the network segments.
*   **Network Traffic Manipulation:** The attacker sends specifically crafted network packets using protocols like DHCP, IGMP, ARP, ICMP or initiates other actions like SSH or web requests.
*  **Timing Analysis:** Attackers measure the timing of network requests to infer data from the covert channel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Device:** Ability to execute malicious code on at least one of the networks (guest or host).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send/receive network traffic on at least one of the network segments.
*   **Knowledge of Router Operation:** The attacker must understand how the router handles specific protocols and resources.
*  **Timing Measurement:** The attacker requires the ability to measure time, likely through software implementation.

**Additional Notes**
* This research provides detailed analysis of various cross router covert channels.
* The research indicates that all tested routers were vulnerable to at least one type of covert channel, and that fixes for these vulnerabilities are not simple software updates and may require hardware level changes.
* The paper suggests methods to measure and evaluate channel quality and proposes possible defense methods.
* The research indicates that some of the findings were disclosed to the vendors of the routers, but no action was taken.
