Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2019-13382
*   **Affected Software:** TechSmith Snagit (specifically versions 2019.1.2, 2018.2.3 and 13.1.6 as per the provided article.)
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way the `TechSmith Uploader Service` (UploaderService.exe) handles file moves, specifically regarding symbolic links and file permissions, combined with insecure file handling by the Techsmith Relay Classic Recorder.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**
    *   The `UploaderService.exe` periodically checks `C:\ProgramData\TechSmith\TechSmith Recorder\QueuedPresentations` for XML files.
    *   Low-privileged users have write access to both `QueuedPresentations` and `InvalidPresentations` folders.
    *   When the service finds an invalid XML file in `QueuedPresentations`, it moves it to `InvalidPresentations`.
    *   The service uses `MoveFileW()` which, when moving files on the same volume, preserves the original DACL of the file.
    *   The service does not validate/remove reparse points before moving the files.
    *   By creating a symbolic link in `InvalidPresentations` to a privileged location (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32\ualapi.dll`), and placing a dummy file in the `QueuedPresentations` folder, a low-privileged user can force the service to move a file to a protected location.  Since the DACL is preserved, the low-privileged user gains write access to that file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a low-privileged user to gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. This is achieved by writing a malicious DLL to a privileged location and loading it.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs local access to the system.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to create a symbolic link.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to write files to specific directories (QueuedPresentations and InvalidPresentations).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have a standard user account on the Windows system where SnagIt is installed. The attacker needs to be able to write to the file system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `UploaderService.exe` runs as `SYSTEM`.
*   The service checks the `QueuedPresentations` folder every 30-60 seconds.
*   The service uses `MoveFileW()`, which retains the original DACL when moving files within the same volume.
*   The exploit involves creating a symbolic link in the `InvalidPresentations` folder, which redirects the file move operation to a privileged location.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Snagit versions 2019.1.3, 2018.2.4 and 13.1.7.
*   The fix implemented involves using `_time64` when moving the file combined with a check for reparse points using `FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT` and removing reparse points if they exist.
