Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-13063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue in the Sahi Pro web application. Specifically, the `script` parameter in the `Script_view` page is susceptible to path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided via the `script` parameter, allowing an attacker to navigate the file system beyond the intended directory.
- **Local and Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the directory traversal vulnerability to access sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files (e.g., `productkey.txt`, revealing the application's product key) or other files containing confidential data.
- **Potential Arbitrary File Access:** By using `../` sequences in the `script` parameter, an attacker can access any file that the web server process has permissions to read.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `Script_view` endpoint.
- **Malicious `script` Parameter:** The attack vector is the `script` parameter in the URL. By injecting sequences such as `../` an attacker can traverse directories and access arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Sahi Pro web application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:**  The attacker needs to understand basic HTTP request and URL manipulation to exploit the vulnerability.
- No authentication required to access the vulnerable endpoint

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL parameter is `script` in `/dyn/Script_view`.
- Example of a vulnerable URL: `http://<target_ip>:9999/_s_/dyn/Script_view?script=/config/productkey.txt`
- The attacker can traverse up directories using `../` in the `script` parameter.
- A Python Proof-of-Concept script is included for testing.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit was tested on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows 7.
- The Sahi Pro version affected is 8.x.
- The vulnerability allows for both local and remote file inclusion.
