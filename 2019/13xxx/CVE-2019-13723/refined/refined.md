{
  "CVE-2019-13723": {
    "Description": "Use after free in WebBluetooth in Google Chrome prior to 78.0.3904.108 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.",
    "Root cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the WebBluetooth component of Chromium.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker who has compromised the renderer process can potentially exploit heap corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote",
      "Crafted HTML page"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Compromised renderer process"
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered through the WebBluetooth API and can lead to arbitrary code execution by exploiting heap corruption in a compromised renderer process. Exploitation requires the user to interact with a crafted HTML page. The vulnerability is related to how bluetooth objects are handled and freed, potentially allowing an attacker to access memory after it has been released."
