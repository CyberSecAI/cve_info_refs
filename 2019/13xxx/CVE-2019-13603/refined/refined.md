{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The initialization vector (IV) used for generating the keystream during fingerprint image obfuscation is predictable or statically coded.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can decrypt the obfuscated fingerprint image if they can obtain it and the predictable initialization vector.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with the ability to sniff the network traffic between the fingerprint reader device and the driver, can obtain the obfuscated fingerprint image and the key. The attacker can calculate the initialization vector based on the predictable pattern.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to eavesdrop on the communication between the fingerprint reader and its driver. No special privileges are needed on the target machine, it only needs a position to sniff the network traffic."
