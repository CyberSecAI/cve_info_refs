{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Zoom client constructs the download URL for updates by simply concatenating strings, allowing an attacker to control the domain part of the URL. Additionally, the filename used to check package signature with pkgutil is not sanitized, leading to command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper URL construction leading to arbitrary domain usage for update manifest.",
      "Unsanitized filename leading to command injection during package signature check."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious update manifest served from a controlled server, masquerading as a valid Zoom update server.",
      "Local webserver request to trigger the update process.",
       "Command injection via crafted package filename."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious manifest on a server that can masquerade as a zoom.us domain, craft a malicious update package, and trigger the Zoom client to download the malicious manifest via a crafted URL. The attacker needs to be able to influence the zoom update process to leverage the vulnerable code."
