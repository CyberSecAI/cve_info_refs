Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a session fixation issue in BD Pyxis systems when they are joined to an Active Directory (AD) domain. The system does not properly restrict access privileges when an AD user account's access should expire.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation (CWE-384):** Existing access privileges are not revoked or restricted when a user's AD account expires or changes. This allows an attacker to potentially reuse a previous session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain access to the device using the Active Directory credentials of a previously authenticated user, potentially after that user's access should have expired.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** This access could allow the attacker to access patient data and medications, depending on the user's previous access level.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack requires network access to the affected Pyxis devices.
*  **Active Directory Integration**: The systems must be joined to an AD domain to be vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Pyxis system on the hospital network.
*   **Knowledge of Previous User Session:** The attacker needs to somehow gain control of or access a previous user's session or authentication context.
*   **Low Skill Level:**  The advisory notes that the vulnerability is considered to be of low skill to exploit, implying that it is not overly complex to execute an attack once an attacker has a foothold.
