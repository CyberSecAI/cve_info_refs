Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-13112:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check on the `length` variable within the `PngChunk::parseChunkContent()` function in `pngchunk_int.cpp`. This length value, derived from an input string, is used to allocate memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The absence of a check on the parsed length value allows an attacker to specify an arbitrarily large size for memory allocation.
*   **Integer Overflow:** While not explicitly stated, the conversion from the input string to the length variable (using `atol`) might be vulnerable to integer overflow if an extremely long string is provided, which could then lead to a smaller, but still large, allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted PNG file with a large length value can cause the application to attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory.
*   **Crash:** The excessive memory allocation triggers a `std::bad_alloc` exception, leading to a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PNG Image File:** An attacker can create a specially crafted PNG image file containing a maliciously formed chunk that, when parsed, leads to the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PNG file to a system/application using the vulnerable `exiv2` library. This could involve a user opening a malicious image, a server processing the file, or any process that relies on `exiv2`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `pngchunk_int.cpp` at line 669.
*   A fix for the vulnerability has been implemented in commit `43f154f44b838e6b232193ccbd48e5a2e94bdd35` in the `0.27-maintenance` branch, and commit `8cdb330743b7b7f1a8e34514effde34d67c77577` in the master branch, which includes a bounds check on the allocation size.
*   The fix involved adding a check that `length` is non-negative and enforcing it using `enforce(length >= 0, Exiv2::kerCorruptedMetadata);`.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported in issue #845 on GitHub.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Exiv2 version 0.27.2.
*   Red Hat has released RHSA-2020:1577, which includes the fix for this CVE.
*   Ubuntu has also released a security notice USN-4056-1, addressing this issue.
*   Debian LTS advisory DLA-3265-1 mentions the fix for this CVE.
