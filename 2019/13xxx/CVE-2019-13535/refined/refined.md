The provided content is related to CVE-2019-13535.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a protection mechanism failure in the RFID security mechanism used by Medtronic Valleylab FT10 and LS10 devices. Specifically, the mechanism does not enforce read protection, allowing full read access to the RFID security data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure:** The RFID security mechanism lacks read protection, which allows an attacker to gain full read access to the security data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive RFID data.
*   **Integrity & Availability (Indirectly):** The vulnerability enables an attacker to connect inauthentic instruments via spoofing. This may lead to loss of performance integrity and platform availability due to incorrect instrument identification and associated parameters.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Physical access:** The attack requires physical access to the affected devices. The attacker needs to be physically present to connect with the RFID mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs physical access to the medical devices (Valleylab FT10/LS10) to be able to read the RFID data.
*   **Low Skill Level:** According to the advisory, the exploitation of this vulnerability requires a low skill level.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected products are Medtronic Valleylab FT10 and LS10 Energy Platforms.
*   The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
*   The advisory mentions that a software patch is available from Medtronic to mitigate the issue.
*   The affected sector is Healthcare and Public Health, and the devices are deployed worldwide.
