{
  "vulnerability": "CVE-2019-13137",
  "description": "ImageMagick before 7.0.8-50 has a memory leak vulnerability in the function ReadPSImage in coders/ps.c.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "ImageMagick before 7.0.8-50"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing `DestroyString` call for `page_geometry` variable after an error handling return, resulting in a memory leak.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Memory leak"
  ],
    "impact": "A memory leak can lead to denial of service if an attacker can continuously trigger the vulnerable code, eventually exhausting available memory resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious postscript file that triggers the vulnerable code path within the `ReadPSImage` function."
    ],
  "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to supply a specially crafted postscript file to an application or system that uses the vulnerable ImageMagick library."
