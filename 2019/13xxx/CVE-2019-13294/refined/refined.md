Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of session control in the `import_stud.php` and `upload_fille.php` files within the AROX School-ERP Pro application. Specifically, the session start and check functions are commented out (disabled using slashes). This allows unauthenticated users to access these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper session management and authentication checks in the mentioned PHP files.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `upload_fille.php` file allows any user to upload files to the `upload_data` directory without any authentication or authorization.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can gain remote code execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the AROX School-ERP application. This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The lack of authentication gives unauthorized users full access to the vulnerable scripts, which leads to the potential of further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is conducted using HTTP requests to interact with the vulnerable PHP files.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a PHP payload disguised as a regular file through the `upload_fille.php` script.
*  **GET Request to uploaded file**: The attacker uses a GET request to the uploaded php file to execute it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server hosting the AROX School-ERP application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability because of the missing session controls.
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to interact with the application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `import_stud.php` and `upload_fille.php`, however the exploit focuses on the upload_fille.php script.
- The Metasploit module leverages the vulnerability to upload a malicious PHP shell to the server, and then executes it.
