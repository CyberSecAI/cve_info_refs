- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel (CWE-288)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via the HTTP interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the device, which is exposed on the network. The CVSS vector string ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)) indicates that a low-privileged attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
