Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13057:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue lies in how OpenLDAP's `slapd` server handles delegated `rootDN` (database administrator) privileges. Specifically, when a server administrator delegates `rootDN` privileges for certain databases but intends to maintain isolation between them (e.g., in a multi-tenant environment), `slapd` does not properly restrict a `rootDN` from requesting authorization as an identity from *another* database.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Authorization Handling:**  A `rootDN` should be limited to managing its own database but the vulnerability allows it to perform actions as if it is a `rootDN` for other databases.
*   **Lack of Database Isolation:** The intended isolation between databases is not enforced, leading to a potential privilege escalation.
*   **SASL bind/proxyAuthz bypass**: A `rootDN` can request authorization from another database during SASL bind or using a `proxyAuthz` control.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information within the OpenLDAP directory. The `rootDN`, intended to have limited database scope, could potentially read data from other databases where it is not supposed to have access.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access**: The vulnerability is exposed through the LDAP network protocol, allowing a remote attacker with network access to attempt an exploit.
*   **SASL Bind/ProxyAuthz**: An attacker who has `rootDN` privileges can leverage a SASL bind or a proxyAuthz (RFC 4370) control to request authorization as an identity from another database

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **`rootDN` Privileges:** The attacker must possess valid `rootDN` credentials for at least one database within the OpenLDAP server.
*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the OpenLDAP `slapd` server via network.
