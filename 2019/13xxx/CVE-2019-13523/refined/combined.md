## 4. MITIGATIONS

Honeywell has released firmware update packages for all affected products. The updates can be obtained with a customer account at the following location (login required):

<https://mywebtech.honeywell.com/Home>

Honeywell also recommends the following mitigating factors that users should take to mitigate this vulnerability:

* Update firmware of vulnerable devices according to affected devices outlined in this advisory.
* Isolate affected systems from the Internet or create additional layers of defense between affected systems and the Internet by placing the affected hardware behind a firewall or into a DMZ.
* If remote connections to the network are required, consider using a VPN or other means to ensure secure remote connections into the network where the device is located.

More information on this issue can be found in Honeywell security notification SN 2019-04-30 01 at the following location on the Honeywell site:

<https://www.security.honeywell.com/-/media/Security/Resources/PDF/Product-Warranty/Security-Notification-May-2019-pdf.pdf?la=en-US&hash=15B712A99CD068FF0D8CB494BC96AB46E2122672>

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
