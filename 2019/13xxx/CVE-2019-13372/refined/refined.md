Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-13372:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a combination of insecure coding practices, specifically:

1.  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `/web/Public/Conn.php` script directly uses user-supplied data in SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows for arbitrary SQL command execution.
2.  **Weak Type Handling in PHP and Session Bypass:** The `/web/Lib/Action/IndexAction.class.php` script uses weak type comparison (`NULL == ''`) allowing an attacker to bypass authentication checks when the session variable `USER_PRIVATEKEY` is not set, combined with an eval() call using unsanitized input.
3. **Lack of Input Sanitization in /web/Lib/Action/PayAction.class.php**: This script uses unsanitized user input from the passcode parameter in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Arbitrary SQL Command Query:** Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary SQL commands via the `/web/Public/Conn.php` script.
2.  **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Unauthenticated RCE via the  `/web/Lib/Action/IndexAction.class.php` script.
3.  **SQL Injection:** The `/web/Lib/Action/PayAction.class.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `passcode` parameter.
4.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `/web/Lib/Action/PayAction.class.php` script is also vulnerable to XSS via the `passcode` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can obtain any data in the database, including admin credentials, through arbitrary SQL command execution.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can create new administrator accounts, or use the extracted credentials to gain full control over the application.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking complete control of the system.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database via SQL injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** Attackers can send malicious POST requests to `/web/Public/Conn.php` with crafted `dbAction` and `dbSQL` parameters to perform arbitrary SQL queries, including data extraction and modification.
*   **HTTP POST Requests and crafted cookies:** Attackers can send a crafted POST request to `/web/Lib/Action/IndexAction.class.php` by setting a username with malicious code and an empty password to bypass authentication checks and trigger the eval function to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** Attackers can send GET requests to `/index.php/Pay/passcodeAuth` with a manipulated `passcode` parameter to exploit SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the D-Link Central WiFi Manager software controller. No prior authentication is required for the SQL injection, RCE and XSS vulnerabilities.

In summary, the vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to gain full control over the D-Link Central WiFi Manager via a number of exploitable vectors.
