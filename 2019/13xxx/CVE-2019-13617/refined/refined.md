The provided content relates to CVE-2019-13617.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `nxt_vsprintf` function within the `nxt_sprintf.c` file of the njs project. This is triggered during error handling while parsing JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow. Specifically, the `memcpy` operation within `nxt_vsprintf` attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted JavaScript file. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious JavaScript file that when processed by NJS, causes a heap overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide malicious JavaScript to be processed by the vulnerable njs component. The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable code path to be executed. This could be in a scenario where the njs library is used to parse untrusted input or process files controlled by the attacker.
