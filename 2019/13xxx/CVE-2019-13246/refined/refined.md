Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** User Mode Write Access Violation
*   **Root Cause:** A write access violation occurs at address `image00400000+0x00000000001a9601` when FastStone Image Viewer attempts to write data to an invalid memory location. Specifically, the instruction `mov word ptr [edi],cx` attempts to write the value of `cx` to the memory address pointed to by `edi`. The debugger output shows that `edi` contains the address `09668250`, and the attempted write results in an access violation.
*   **Impact:** The vulnerability is classified as "EXPLOITABLE". User mode write access violations that are not near NULL are generally considered exploitable, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a crafted image file in FastStone Image Viewer.
*   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file that, when processed by FastStone Image Viewer, triggers the write access violation.
