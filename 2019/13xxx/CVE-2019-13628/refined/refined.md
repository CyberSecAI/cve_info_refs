CVE-2019-13628 is a vulnerability in wolfSSL/wolfCrypt, specifically an ECDSA implementation that leaks the bit-length of the scalar during scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve. This leakage allows for practical recovery of the long-term private key.

Here's a breakdown:

- **Vulnerability:** Timing side-channel in ECDSA implementations due to bit-length leakage during scalar multiplication.
- **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability is caused by timing differences based on the number of iterations in the scalar multiplication loop. The implementation uses a Montgomery ladder, but the loop termination depends on the bit length of the scalar (nonce), leaking information.
- **Weakness:**  The code does not run in constant time due to variable loop iterations dependent on the nonce's bit length.
- **Attack Vector:** Attacker measures the execution time of ECDSA signing operations.
- **Impact:**  Private key recovery. An attacker can recover the private key after observing a few hundreds to a few thousands of signatures on known messages using lattice techniques.
- **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to measure the duration of signing operations. More accurate measurements reduce the number of signatures needed.
- **Affected versions:** All wolfSSL/wolfCrypt versions up to 4.0.0.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.1.0.
