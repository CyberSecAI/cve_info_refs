The content is related to CVE-2019-13980.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper restrictions and validations on file uploads, specifically through the avatar upload functionality. The system fails to validate file types and the upload directory has execute permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file type.
- Insecure directory permissions: The upload directory has execute permissions enabled.
- Lack of sanitization of uploaded files: The uploaded files are not being checked or sanitized to remove potentially malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can upload a web shell, gain control of the accounts and workstations of application users and administrators, and take control of the server itself, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the backend server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the file upload functionality, specifically when uploading user avatars.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to upload files through the avatar upload feature, and needs to be able to craft or acquire a malicious web shell file. No high level technical knowledge is required, but the attacker needs some knowledge on how to create a malicious file.
