Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2019-13400:

**Root Cause:**
The FortiCam FCM-MB40 stores administrative user credentials (username and password) in cleartext within the filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unprotected storage of credentials.
- Credentials accessible via file system (`/etc/appWeb/appweb.pass`).
- Credentials accessible through web interface `/cgi-bin/getuserinfo.cgi?mode=info`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker gaining read access to the file system or the web interface can acquire the administrative credentials.
- If the same password is used by FortiRecorder for all connected FortiCams, an attacker gaining access to one device could potentially compromise all devices managed by that FortiRecorder instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Gaining direct read access to the device's filesystem.
- Accessing the `/cgi-bin/getuserinfo.cgi?mode=info` page through the web administration interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to gain read access to the device's filesystem (physical access or through a different vulnerability).
- Ability to access the device's web administration interface.
