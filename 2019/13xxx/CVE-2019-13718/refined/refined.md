Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the identified CVEs:

**CVE-2019-13718:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient data validation in the Omnibox (address bar) of Google Chrome.
*   **Vulnerability:**  IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) homograph spoofing. This allows an attacker to craft a domain name using characters that look similar to those in another domain name, potentially tricking users into believing they are visiting a legitimate site.
*   **Impact:** Domain spoofing. An attacker can create a malicious website with a domain name that visually appears identical or very similar to a trusted one. This could lead to phishing attacks or the distribution of malware.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network. The attacker hosts the malicious site with a spoofed domain name. The user needs to visit the crafted malicious URL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to register a domain name that uses IDN homographs to mimic a legitimate domain. They do not need any special privileges to initiate the attack. They need to lure the victim into visiting the malicious website.

**CVE-2019-13717:**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect security UI in full screen mode within Google Chrome.
*   **Vulnerability:** The security UI could be obscured by a remote attacker using a crafted HTML page, which could potentially hide important security notifications from the user while in fullscreen mode.
*   **Impact:**  Hiding security UI, which could lead to users being unaware of security-related events or warnings, potentially facilitating phishing or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network. The attacker crafts a malicious website with a specially designed HTML page to obscure the security UI and lures the user to visit the website.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage. The user interaction of entering fullscreen mode is needed for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**CVE-2019-13716:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient policy enforcement in service workers within Google Chrome.
*   **Vulnerability:**  A remote attacker can bypass navigation restrictions using a crafted HTML page.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can use service workers to bypass navigation restrictions, potentially leading to malicious redirects or cross-site scripting attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network. The attacker hosts a website with crafted HTML that exploits the service worker flaw.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that triggers a flaw within the service worker.

**CVE-2019-15903:**

*   **Root Cause:** An issue in `libexpat` where crafted XML input can cause the parser to transition from DTD parsing to document parsing too early, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read.
*  **Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer over-read due to an incorrect parsing state transition.
*   **Impact:** A potential Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application due to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network. An attacker needs to supply specially crafted XML that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to control or influence the XML data provided to the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   All of these CVEs were resolved in Google Chrome version 78.0.3904.70.
*   The SUSE advisory also includes information regarding fixes in their products.
