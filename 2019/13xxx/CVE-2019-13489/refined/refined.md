- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User-supplied data is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can dump the entire database of the `trape` application. Specifically, by injecting a time-delaying function, they can determine information about the database by observing the response time.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/bs` endpoint with a malicious payload within the `t` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the trape application.
