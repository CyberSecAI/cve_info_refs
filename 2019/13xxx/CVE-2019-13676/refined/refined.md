  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability involves a certificate warning where the Google URI is displayed instead of the actual site's URI.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary weakness is an incorrect display of the URI during a certificate warning.",
      "This could mislead users about the identity of the site they are connecting to."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is a potential spoofing issue where users might mistakenly believe they are interacting with a Google service when they are not. This could lead to users ignoring certificate warnings or potentially sharing information with malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker would need to present a certificate that would trigger a warning.",
      "The attack vector involves manipulating the certificate to cause the browser to display the Google URI during the warning."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must be able to present a certificate that will trigger a warning.",
      "The attacker may need to intercept or control the network connection.",
