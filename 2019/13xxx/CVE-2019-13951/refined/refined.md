Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of both vulnerabilities is the lack of bounds checking in the `set_ipv4()` and `set_ipv6()` functions within the `zscan_rfc1035.rl` file. Specifically, the code calculates the length (`len`) of the input string but doesn't verify if it exceeds the buffer size (`txt`) before copying data into it using `memcpy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `set_ipv4` function uses a fixed-size buffer `txt[16]`, and `set_ipv6` uses a fixed-size buffer `txt[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN + 1]`. In both cases, if the length of input string exceeds these sizes, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Stack-based buffer overflows can overwrite return addresses and other critical data on the stack. In a successful exploitation, this could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A simpler exploit might overwrite stack data leading to program crashes or unexpected behavior causing a denial of service.
*   **Potential Data Corruption**: Overflowing the buffer may overwrite adjacent variables on the stack, leading to unexpected program behavior and potential data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DNS Zone Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted DNS zone files. An attacker could create a malicious zone file containing specially crafted long IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted zone file to gdnsd that will be parsed by the vulnerable functions.
*  **Knowledge of format:** The attacker needs to know the DNS zone file format to craft the input to trigger the vulnerability.

**More Details than CVE:**

The provided issue report includes specific code snippets and example inputs to reproduce the buffer overflow, which is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
It specifies the vulnerable functions `set_ipv4` and `set_ipv6` inside the `zscan_rfc1035.rl` file.
The issue report shows concrete example inputs to trigger both vulnerabilities, using very large IP addresses.
It also clarifies that American Fuzzy Lop was used in finding the issues.
