The provided content describes three stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in MiniCMS.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is stored in the database and later displayed on web pages. Specifically, HTML and JavaScript code injected by the user is not encoded or filtered, allowing it to be executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** The vulnerabilities are stored XSS, meaning the malicious scripts are stored in the application's database. When a user views the affected pages, these stored scripts are executed.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user inputs in multiple areas, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be injected into the system.
*   **Inconsistent Encoding:** While the front-end encodes the payload, it can be circumvented with Burp Suite, indicating a lack of server-side sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to the following:
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, allowing them to perform a wide range of malicious actions, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Account Compromise:** If an administrator account is targeted, the attacker could gain full control of the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Stored XSS 1 (post-edit.php):**
    1.  The attacker navigates to the article edit page.
    2.  The attacker injects a malicious script into the content box.
    3.  The attacker uses Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request, sending the payload without front-end encoding.
    4.  When a user views the article page, the malicious script executes.
*   **Stored XSS 2 (conf.php):**
    1.  The attacker navigates to the configuration page.
    2.  The attacker injects the malicious script into the comment input field.
    3.  The attacker writes a new article and enables comments.
    4.  When a user views the article with comments enabled, the malicious script executes.
*   **Stored XSS 3 (page-edit.php):**
    1.  The attacker navigates to the page edit page.
    2.  The attacker injects the malicious script into the content box.
    3.  The attacker uses Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request, sending the payload without front-end encoding, and URL-encoding the "+".
    4.  When a user views the page, the malicious script executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Admin/Editor Interface:** The attacker needs to be logged into the application with sufficient privileges to edit posts, pages or configuration settings.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to use a tool like Burp Suite to manipulate the requests sent to the server.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The report provides Proof of Concept (POC) steps along with screenshots that clearly describe how to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities are found in `post-edit.php`, `conf.php`, and `page-edit.php`.
*   The payload used for all three XSS cases is `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`. For XSS2, the payload used is `<script>alert("2:"+document.domain)</script>`, and for XSS3 it's `<script>alert("3: "+document.domain)</script>`.
