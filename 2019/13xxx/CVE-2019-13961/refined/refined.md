CVE-2019-13961:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The file `files.upload-script.php` lacks CSRF protection. Additionally, the application does not validate the type of uploaded files and doesn't rename them after upload.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CSRF vulnerability, lack of file type validation, and no renaming of uploaded files.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can trick an authenticated administrator into uploading a webshell, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
  - Attack vectors: An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a CSRF exploit that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, uploads a webshell to the server.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage.
