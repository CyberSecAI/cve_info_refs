{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect access control in API functions `pages.seen` and `pages.update`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "The password hash of the page creator, which should not be publicly available, can be retrieved by making API calls for page metadata.",
    "Improper access control allows retrieval of sensitive user data."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can obtain the password hash of the creator of a page.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs access to the wiki to make API calls for page metadata or updating the page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to the wiki, typically a logged-in user or an authenticated user."
