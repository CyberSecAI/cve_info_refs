- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient resource pool handling when processing large HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to its inability to handle large HTTP requests, resulting in insufficient resource pool allocation (CWE-410).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, compromising the availability of the service provided by the software.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to send a large HTTP request to the network port of the host where WinAC RTX is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the affected systems. No system privileges or user interaction is needed for exploitation.
