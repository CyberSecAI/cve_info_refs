SUMMARY

A vulnerability in SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 controller software could allow an attacker to perform a
denial-of-service attack if a large HTTP request is sent to the network port of the host where WinAC RTX
is running.

Siemens has released SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 incl. SP3 Update 1 that ﬁxes the vulnerability, and
recommends that customers update to this new version.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict network access to the host containing the affected service.

• If the service is not used as a server, conﬁgure Windows Firewall to disable communications on the

port of the vulnerable service.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13921

Affected versions of the software contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker
to trigger a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability can be triggered if a large HTTP request is
sent to the executing service.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise availability of the service provided by the software.
