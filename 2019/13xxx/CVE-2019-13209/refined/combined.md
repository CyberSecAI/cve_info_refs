# Release v2.1.11

## Important

* This release addresses a security vulnerability found in Rancher. The issue was found and reported by Matt Belisle and Alex Stevenson at Workiva, and applies to Rancher versions v2.0.0-v2.0.15, v2.1.0-v2.1.10, v2.2.0-v2.2.4. The fix for this vulnerability is also available in Rancher v2.2.5, and v2.0.16. Rancher v1.6 is not affected. The vulnerability is known as a [Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking attack](https://www.christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html). This attack allows an exploiter to gain access to clusters managed by Rancher with the roles/permissions of a victim. It requires that a victim to be logged into a Rancher server and then access a third-party site hosted by the exploiter. Once that is accomplished, the exploiter is able to execute commands against the Kubernetes API with the permissions and identity of the victim. You can view the official CVE here [[CVE-2019-13209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13209)]

`rancher/rancher:v2.1.11` image is made available in `server-charts/latest` and `server-chart/stable` Rancher helm repos.

## Known Major Issues

* Clusters created through Rancher can sometimes get stuck in provisioning [[#15970](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/15970)] [[#15969](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/15969)] [[#15695](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/15695)]
* The upgrade for Rancher node-agent daemonset can sometimes get stuck due to pod removal failure on a Kubernetes side [[#16722](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/16722)]

## Major Bug Fixes since v2.1.10

* Fixed an issue when node driver machine provisioning could fail with “something went wrong running an SSH command” error [[21013](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/21013)]

## Versions

> **NOTE** - Image Name Changes: Please note that as of v2.0.0, our images will be rancher/rancher and rancher/rancher-agent. If you are using v1.6, please continue to use rancher/server and rancher/agent.

### Images

* rancher/rancher:v2.1.11
* rancher/rancher-agent:v2.1.11

### Tools

* cli - [v2.0.6](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.0.6)
* rke - [v0.1.18](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v0.1.18)

### Kubernetes

* [1.11.9](https://github.com/rancher/hyperkube/releases/tag/v1.11.9-rancher1)
* [1.12.7](https://github.com/rancher/hyperkube/releases/tag/v1.12.7-rancher1)
* [1.13.5](https://github.com/rancher/hyperkube/releases/tag/v1.13.5-rancher1) (default)

## Upgrades and Rollbacks

Rancher supports both upgrade and rollback starting with v2.0.2. Please note the version you would like to [upgrade](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/) or [rollback](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks/) to change the Rancher version.

Due to the HA improvements introduced in the v2.1.0 release, the Rancher helm chart is the only supported method for installing or upgrading Rancher. Please use the Rancher helm chart to install HA Rancher. For details, see the [HA Install - Installation Outline](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha/#installation-outline).

If you are currently using the RKE add-on install method, see [Migrating from a RKE add-on install](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/upgrades/migrating-from-rke-add-on/) for details on how to move to using a helm chart.

**Any upgrade from a version prior to v2.0.3, when scaling up workloads, new pods will be created [[#14136](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/14136)]** - In order to update scheduling rules for workloads [[#13527](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/13527)], a new field was added to all workloads on `update`, which will cause any pods in workloads from previous versions to re-create.

> **Note:** When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post upgrade would not be reflected. In the case of rolling back using a [Rancher single-node install](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node-install/), you must specify the exact version you want to change the Rancher version to, rather than using the default `:latest` tag.

> **Note:** If you had the helm stable catalog enabled in v2.0.0, we’ve updated the catalog to start pointing directly to the Kubernetes helm repo instead of an internal repo. Please delete the custom catalog that is now showing up and re-enable the helm stable. [[#13582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/13582)]

## Description

![@tkuther](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63717?v=4&size=48)[tkuther](https://github.com/tkuther)opened [on May 18, 2018](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/13582#issue-324326644)

**Rancher versions:**

rancher/server or rancher/rancher: v2.0.0

rancher/agent or rancher/rancher-agent: 2.0.0

**Infrastructure Stack versions:**

kubernetes (if applicable): v1.10.1-rancher1

**Docker version: (`docker version`,`docker info` preferred)**

18.03.1-ce

**Operating system and kernel: (`cat /etc/os-release`, `uname -r` preferred)**

Ubuntu 16.04.4

**Type/provider of hosts: (VirtualBox/Bare-metal/AWS/GCE/DO)**

ESX

**Setup details: (single node rancher vs. HA rancher, internal DB vs. external DB)**

single node

**Environment Template: (Cattle/Kubernetes/Swarm/Mesos)**

rke custom nodes

**Steps to Reproduce:**

* enable Helm stable catalog
* hit refresh after it got added, just to be sure
* check latest "Prometheus (from Helm)" template version for example

**Results:**

Latest "Prometheus (from Helm)" template version is 6.2.0, which is quite old.

Using helm client, the latest version for stable/prometheus is 6.7.0

Same for others like mariadb (3.0.3 vs. 4.0.0)

# Release v2.2.5

## Important notes

* This release addresses a security vulnerability found in Rancher. The issue was found and reported by Matt Belisle and Alex Stevenson at Workiva, and applies to Rancher versions v2.0.0-v2.0.15, v2.1.0-v2.1.10, v2.2.0-v2.2.4. The fix for this vulnerability is also available in Rancher v2.1.11, and v2.0.16. Rancher v1.6 is not affected. The vulnerability is known as a [Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking attack](https://www.christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html). This attack allows an exploiter to gain access to clusters managed by Rancher with the roles/permissions of a victim. It requires that a victim to be logged into a Rancher server and then access a third-party site hosted by the exploiter. Once that is accomplished, the exploiter is able to execute commands against the Kubernetes API with the permissions and identity of the victim. You can view the official CVE here [[CVE-2019-13209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13209)]

As a result, the following versions are now latest and stable:

| Type | Rancher Version | Docker Tag | Helm Repo | Helm Chart Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latest | v2.2.5 | `rancher/rancher:latest` | server-charts/latest | v2.2.5 |
| Stable | v2.2.5 | `rancher/rancher:stable` | server-charts/stable | v2.2.5 |

Please review our [version documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/server-tags/) for more details on versioning and tagging conventions.

## Other notes

### Certificate expiry on Rancher provisioned clusters

In Rancher 2.0 and 2.1, the auto generated certificates for Rancher provisioned clusters have 1 year of expiry. It means if you created a Rancher provisioned cluster about 1 year ago, you need to rotate the certificates, otherwise the cluster will go into a bad state when the certificate expires. In Rancher 2.2.x, the rotation can be performed from Rancher UI, more details are [here](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/certificate-rotation/).

### Additional Steps Required for Air Gap Installations and Upgrades

In v2.2.0, we’ve introduced a “system catalog” for managing micro-services that Rancher deploys for certain features such as Global DNS, Alerts, and Monitoring. These additional steps are documented as part of [air gap installation instructions](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/air-gap-high-availability/).

### Known Major Issues

* Cluster alerting and logging can get stuck in Updating state after upgrading Rancher. Workaround steps are provided in the issue [[21480](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/21480)]
* Certificate rotate for Rancher provisioned clusters will not work for the clusters which certificates had expired on Rancher versions v2.0.13 and earlier on 2.0.x release line, and 2.1.8 or earlier on 2.1.x release line. The issue won’t exist if the certificates expired on later versions of Rancher. Steps to workaround can be found in comments to [[20381](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/20381)]
* Catalog app revisions are not visible to the regular user; as a result regular user is not able to rollback the app [[20204](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/20204)]
* Global DNS entries are not properly updated when a node that was hosting an associated ingress becomes unavailable. A records to the unavailable hosts will remain on the ingress and in the DNS entry [[#18932](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/18932)]
* If you have Rancher cluster with OpenStack cloud provider having LoadBalancer set, and the cluster was provisioned on version 2.2.3 or less, the upgrade to the Rancher version v2.2.4 and up will fail. Steps to mitigate can be found in the comment to [[20699](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/20699)]

## Versions

### Images

* rancher/rancher:v2.2.5
* rancher/rancher-agent:v2.2.5

### Tools

* cli - [v2.2.0](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
* rke - [v0.2.5](https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/tag/v0.2.5)

### System Charts Branch - For air gap installs

* system charts branch - [`release-v2.2`](https://github.com/rancher/system-charts/tree/release-v2.2) - This is the branch used to populate the catalog items required for tools such as monitoring, logging, alerting and global DNS. To be able to use these features in an air gap install, you will need to mirror the `system-charts` repository to a location in your network that Rancher can reach and configure Rancher to use that repository.

### Kubernetes

* [1.12.9](https://github.com/rancher/hyperkube/releases/tag/v1.12.9-rancher1)

* [1.15.0](https://github.com/rancher/hyperkube/releases/tag/v1.15.0-rancher1) (experimental)

## Upgrades and Rollbacks

Rancher supports both upgrade and rollback starting with v2.0.2. Please note the version you would like to [upgrade](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/) or [rollback](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks/) to change the Rancher version.

Due to the HA improvements introduced in the v2.1.0 release, the Rancher helm chart is the only supported method for installing or upgrading Rancher. Please use the Rancher helm chart to install HA Rancher. For details, see the [HA Install - Installation Outline](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha/#installation-outline).

If you are currently using the RKE add-on install method, see [Migrating from a RKE add-on install](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/upgrades/migrating-from-rke-add-on/) for details on how to move to using a helm chart.

**Any upgrade from a version prior to v2.0.3, when scaling up workloads, new pods will be created [[#14136](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/14136)]** - In order to update scheduling rules for workloads [[#13527](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/13527)], a new field was added to all workloads on `update`, which will cause any pods in workloads from previous versions to re-create.

**Note:** When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post upgrade would not be reflected. In the case of rolling back using a [Rancher single-node install](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node-install/), you must specify the exact version you want to change the Rancher version to, rather than using the default `:latest` tag.

**Note:** If you had the helm stable catalog enabled in v2.0.0, we’ve updated the catalog to start pointing directly to the Kubernetes helm repo instead of an internal repo. Please delete the custom catalog that is now showing up and re-enable the helm stable. [[#13582](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/13582)]

# Release v2.0.16

## Important

### Security fixes

This release addresses a security vulnerability found in Rancher. The issue was found and reported by Matt Belisle and Alex Stevenson at Workiva, and applies to Rancher versions v2.0.0-v2.0.15, v2.1.0-v2.1.10, v2.2.0-v2.2.4. The fix for this vulnerability is also available in Rancher v2.2.5, and v2.1.11. Rancher v1.6 is not affected. The vulnerability is known as a [Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking attack](https://www.christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html). This attack allows an exploiter to gain access to clusters managed by Rancher with the roles/permissions of a victim. It requires that a victim to be logged into a Rancher server and then access a third-party site hosted by the exploiter. Once that is accomplished, the exploiter is able to execute commands against the Kubernetes API with the permissions and identity of the victim. You can view the official CVE here [[CVE-2019-13209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13209)]

### Rancher Provisioned Clusters Certificate Expiry

In Rancher 2.0 and 2.1, the auto generated certificates for Rancher provisioned clusters have 1 year of expiry. It means if you created a Rancher provisioned cluster about 1 year ago, you need to rotate the certificates, otherwise the cluster will go into a bad state when the certificate expires. Rancher v2.2.x provides UI support for certificate rotation. Starting Rancher v2.0.14, the rotation can be performed through the Rancher API, more details are [here](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/certificate-rotation/#certificate-rotation-in-rancher-v2-1-x-and-v2-0-x).

### Network Policies

The default network selected when creating a Kubernetes cluster has been updated to `canal` with *no network policies*. With this change in default behavior, there are no network policy enforcements between projects, which means there *is* inter-project communication.

If you want to turn on network policies, which was the previous default behavior, then you would need to edit your cluster options to enable these network policies when deploying a cluster.

### Namespaces

As of v2.0.7, we introduced a “System Project”, which has specific namespaces, i.e. `cattle-namesystem`. If these namespaces have been assigned to a project before upgrading, please move them out of the project before upgrading, so they can be appropriately moved into the system project.

## Versions

> **NOTE** - Image Name Changes: Please note that as of v2.0.0, our images will be `rancher/rancher` and `rancher/rancher-agent`. If you are using v1.6, please continue to use `rancher/server` and `rancher/agent`.

* rancher/rancher:v2.0.16
* rancher/rancher-agent:v2.0.16

## Rancher Server Tags

Rancher server has 2 different tags. For each major release tag, we will provide documentation for the specific version.

* `rancher/rancher:latest` tag will be our latest development builds. These builds will have been validated through our CI automation framework. These releases are not meant for deployment in production.
* `rancher/rancher:stable` tag will be our latest stable release builds. This tag is the version that we recommend for production.

Please do not use releases with a `rc{n}` suffix. These `rc` builds are meant for the Rancher team to test builds.

#### Latest - v2.2.5 - `rancher/rancher:latest`

#### Stable - v2.2.5 - `rancher/rancher:stable`

`rancher/rancher:v2.0.16` image is made available in `server-charts/latest` and `server-chart/stable` Rancher helm repos.

## Upgrades and Rollbacks

Rancher supports both upgrade and rollback starting with v2.0.2. Please note the version you would like to [upgrade](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/) or [rollback](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/backups/rollbacks/) to change the Rancher version.

**Any upgrade after v2.0.3, when scaling up workloads, new pods will be created [[#14136](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/14136)]** - In order to update scheduling rules for workloads [[#13527](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/13527)], a new field was added to all workloads on `update`, which will cause any pods in workloads from previous versions to re-create.

> **Note:** When rolling back, we are expecting you to rollback to the state at the time of your upgrade. Any changes post upgrade would not be reflected. In the case of rolling back using a [Rancher single-node install](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node-install/), you must specify the exact version you want to change the Rancher version to, rather than using the default `:latest` tag.

## Enhancements

## Known Major Issues

* Sometimes new Kubernetes version doesn’t get updated right away on the upgraded Kubernetes clusters; it gets fixed as soon as user application gets deployed on the node [[15831](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/15831)]

## Major Bug Fixes since v2.0.15

* Fixed an issue when node driver machine provisioning could fail with “something went wrong running an SSH command” error [[21012](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/21012)]
