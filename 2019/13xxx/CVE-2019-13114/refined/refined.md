Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13114:

*   **Vulnerability:** NULL Pointer Dereference
*   **Affected Component:** `http.c` in Exiv2
*   **Versions Affected:** Exiv2 through 0.27.1
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises when the `http.c` component receives a crafted HTTP response from a malicious HTTP server that lacks a space character. This causes the `strchr` function to return a NULL pointer, which is then dereferenced, leading to a crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious HTTP server sends a crafted response without a space character to an Exiv2 client.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application crashes due to the NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Attacker Requirements:** The attacker needs to control an HTTP server that interacts with an Exiv2 client. The attacker crafts the HTTP response.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to initiate the HTTP request.
*   **Severity:** Moderate

The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted HTTP response from a malicious server that lacks a space character. The `strchr` function fails, and the resulting NULL pointer dereference leads to a denial-of-service condition.

Several sources indicate that the vulnerability is resolved in Exiv2 version 0.27.2. Patches and updates were released by SUSE, Red Hat, Fedora, and Ubuntu to address this issue.
