WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable the DHCP client and use static IP address conﬁguration instead (Note that the DHCP client

is disabled by default on APOGEE/TALON and Desigo products.)

• APOGEE MEC, MBC, PXC (versions prior to V2.8.2): Use static IP address conﬁguration as

described above

• APOGEE PXC Series and TALON TC Series products: If using static IP address is not possible,

update to the ﬁx version listed above or contact your local Siemens ofﬁce for support

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13939

By sending specially crafted DHCP packets to a device where the DHCP client is enabled, an attacker
could change the IP address of the device to an invalid value.

The vulnerability could affect availability and integrity of the device. Adjacent network access is
required, but no authentication and no user interaction is needed to conduct an attack.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

* Disable the DHCP client and use static IP address configuration instead (Note that the DHCP client is disabled by default on APOGEE/TALON and Desigo products.)
* APOGEE MEC, MBC, PXC (versions prior to V2.8.2): Use static IP address configuration as described above
* APOGEE PXC Series and TALON TC Series products: If using static IP address is not possible, update to the fix version listed above or contact your local Siemens office for support

Product specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section [Affected Products and Solution](#affected_products_and_solution).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general_recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMOTICS CONNECT 400 is a connector and sensor box, mounted on low-voltage motors to provide analytics data for the MindSphere application SIDRIVE IQ Fleet.

The APOGEE MEC (Modular Equipement Controller), MBC (Modular Building Controller), and PXC are Direct Digital Control (DDC) devices and an integral part of the APOGEE Automation System. These are legacy devices, replaced by the APOGEE PXC Modular and Compact Series.

The APOGEE PXC Modular and Compact Series are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC) devices and an integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

The Desigo PX automation stations and operator units control and monitor building automation systems. They allow for alarm signaling, time-based programs and trend logging.

The TALON TC Modular and Compact Series are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC) devices and an integral part of the TALON Automation System.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) ([https://www.first.org/cvss](https://www.first.org/cvss/)). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed
list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found
at: <https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13939

By sending specially crafted DHCP packets to a device where the DHCP client is enabled, an attacker could change the IP address of the device to an invalid value.

The vulnerability could affect availability and integrity of the device. Adjacent network access is required, but no authentication and no user interaction is needed to conduct an attack.
