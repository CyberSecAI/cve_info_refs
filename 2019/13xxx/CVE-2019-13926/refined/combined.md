WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Only access links from trusted sources in the browser you use to access the SCALANCE S-600

administration website.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE S-600 devices (S602, S612, S623, S627-2M) are used to protect trusted industrial
networks from untrusted networks. The S-600 devices are superseded by the SCALANCE SC-600
devices (SC622-2C, SC632-2C, SC636-2C, SC642-2C, SC646-2C), or the SCALANCE S615.

The SCALANCE SC-600 devices (SC622-2C, SC632-2C, SC636-2C, SC642-2C, SC646-2C) are used to
protect trusted industrial networks from untrusted networks. They allow ﬁltering incoming and outgoing
network connections in different ways.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
