### CVE-2019-13454

Based on the provided information, the following details about CVE-2019-13454 can be extracted:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Division by Zero in `RemoveDuplicateLayers` function at `MagickCore/layer.c`.
*   **Vulnerability**: A division by zero error occurs during the merging of time delays between two identical images, specifically when `curr->ticks_per_second` is zero.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS). The division by zero error can cause the program to crash, leading to a DoS.
*   **Attack Vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious image file that, when processed by ImageMagick, triggers the division by zero error.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image to ImageMagick for processing. No special privileges are required.

The issue is located in `MagickCore/layer.c` within the `RemoveDuplicateLayers` function. The vulnerability is triggered when the program attempts to merge time delays of identical images.

The Ubuntu security notice (USN-4192-1) mentions that several security issues, including CVE-2019-13454, were fixed in ImageMagick. It states that if a user or automated system using ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service.
