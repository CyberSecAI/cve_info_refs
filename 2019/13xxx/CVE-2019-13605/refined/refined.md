Login with valid username and invalid password\n2. Replace the target username in '<username>||/<username>/theme/original'\n3. Convert to base64\n4. Place the base64 value to HTTP response body\n5. Gain access to user area\nSteps to Reproduce Version 0.9.8.838 to 0.9.8.846:\n1. Create a testing environment\n1.1 Create user as a target username\n1.2 Login as the user\n1.3 Save the HTTP response body (token value)\n2. Login to the real target with valid username and invalid password\n3. Place the value we saved from step 1.3 in HTTP response body\n4.
