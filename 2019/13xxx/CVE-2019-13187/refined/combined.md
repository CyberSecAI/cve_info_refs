### What is symphonyextensions.com?

Symphony Extensions tracks [Symphony CMS](http://getsymphony.com) extensions that are hosted on [Github](https://github.com).

### How do I submit an extension?

Host your extension on Github and make sure the repository has a good README and an [extension.meta.xml file](/schemas/extension/). Then [sign in](/sign-in/) to this site using your GitHub profile where you will see a list of your public repositories. Pick one, and add it to the site. When you make changes, just update the XML file in your repository and we do the rest.

### What is an extension.meta.xml file?

It is an XML file that you add to your repository to describe your extension. You can include a name and description, developer contact details, version history, changelog, dependencies and more. Please [read the documentation](/schemas/extension/) for a full list. You can use the [lint tool](/lint) to check your XML against the schema before submitting your extension to the site.

### Who runs this site?

This site is now run by the community [@symextensions](http://twitter.com/symextensions). The site was created by [nickdunn](http://nick-dunn.co.uk/). Contact him at [@nickdunn](http://twitter.com/nickdunn)

## Warning

Uploaded images are stored in a folder named `redactor` in your `/workspace` folder.
You will need to alter your .htaccess file to allow your webserver to expose these files. This is required in order to show them in your text editor. Next versions of this extension will make this location configurable.
