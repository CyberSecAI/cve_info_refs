- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper bounds checking when processing project files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the EZ PLC Editor.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or disruption of industrial processes.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious project file specifically designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system running the vulnerable software, and needs to induce a user to open the malicious project file in the EZ PLC editor.
