# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## AI-Driven Security Testing Platform

Mayhemâs AI-driven behavioral analysis selects the most effective security testing techniques, such as fuzz testing and symbolic execution, running thousands of tests every minute.

Unlike traditional static analysis (SAST) tools, Mayhem detects both known and unknown vulnerabilities with advanced methods that go beyond static analysis.

As the engine learns and adapts, it dynamically expands test coverage, ensuring comprehensive security across your software.

## Reduce the Noise: Remediate Only What Matters

Mayhem cuts 60-90% of unnecessary security alerts. It identifies unused packages by showing which parts of your app and third-party components actually run, helping you remove them. When finding vulnerabilities, Mayhem simulates attacks to confirm exploitability, reducing false positives and ensuring you focus only on real threats.

## Automated Security Testing

Mayhem automates thousands of tests, letting you focus on developing applications without interruption. Its regression testing ensures that code updates donât disrupt existing functionality by analyzing changes in real time and identifying vulnerabilities as they emerge.

With proof and reproduction steps for each identified issue, Mayhem helps you skip lengthy triage processes and prioritize quick fixes, speeding up response times and improving mean time to remediation (MTTR).
