The provided content relates to CVE-2019-13023.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The web interface of the JETSELECT application stored sensitive information (RADIUS secrets and SNMP strings) in cleartext within a property called `password` in the HTML of the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data:** RADIUS secrets and SNMP strings, which are sensitive credentials, were stored in cleartext within the HTML of the web page.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Lower privileged users, such as those with the ETO role, could access this sensitive information, despite not having administrative privileges and not being intended to view the data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Attackers, including low-privileged users, can easily obtain cleartext RADIUS secrets and SNMP strings.
*   **Compromise of Network Security:**  Compromised RADIUS secrets could enable unauthorized network access. Compromised SNMP strings might allow attackers to monitor or manipulate network devices.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Compromise of these credentials can potentially be used for lateral movement or privilege escalation within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the web interface of the JETSELECT application.
*   **HTML Inspection:** The attacker needs to inspect the HTML source code of the webpage to locate the sensitive information in the cleartext `password` property.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires access to the network where the JETSELECT application is hosted.
*   **Web Interface Access:** The attacker needs access to the application's web interface, but does not require administrator level access.  Even a low-privileged user with access to the web interface can exploit the vulnerability.
