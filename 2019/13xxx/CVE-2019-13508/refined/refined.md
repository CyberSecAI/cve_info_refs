Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-13508:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap overflow in FreeTDS, specifically triggered when a malicious server forces a downgrade to protocol version 5.0 and then sends a User-Defined Type (UDT).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow occurring in the heap memory. This happens due to improper handling of UDT types when the protocol is downgraded to version 5.0.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the FreeTDS client application, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by carefully crafting the malicious network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, originating from a malicious SQL server.
*   **Protocol Downgrade:** The attacker manipulates the communication to force the FreeTDS client to downgrade to protocol version 5.0.
*   **Malicious UDT:** The malicious server sends a specially crafted User-Defined Type (UDT) after the protocol downgrade, which triggers the heap overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious SQL Server:** The attacker needs to control or have access to a malicious SQL server.
*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the target FreeTDS client over the network.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (Possible):** Although not explicitly stated, a man-in-the-middle position might be required to force the protocol downgrade, depending on the capabilities of the client and the server.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the `src/tds/data.c` file of FreeTDS. Specifically, the fix ensures that the UDT has the `varint` set to 8, preventing the heap overflow. This patch is identified by the commit hash `0df4eb82a0e3ff844e373d7c9f9c6c813925e2ac`. The malicious server exploits the fact that the FreeTDS client, after a protocol downgrade, does not properly handle the UDT type, which causes a heap buffer overflow.

**Additional Information from the Content:**
*   **Affected Versions:** All FreeTDS versions starting from 0.95 are affected, but specific versions mentioned are 1.1.11 (in SUSE advisory) and 1.00.82 (in Ubuntu advisory).
*   **Fix:** The fix is implemented by ensuring the UDT has the `varint` set to 8 within `src/tds/data.c`, as per commit `0df4eb82a0e3ff844e373d7c9f9c6c813925e2ac`.
*   **Vendor Fixes:** Both SUSE and Ubuntu have released security updates to address this vulnerability in their respective products.
*   **CVSS Score:** SUSE provides a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) and a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
