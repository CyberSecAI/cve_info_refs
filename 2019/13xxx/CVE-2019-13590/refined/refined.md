Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13590:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow during an integer addition in the `startread` function within `sox-fmt.h`. The result of the addition, which wraps around to 0 due to the overflow, is then passed to the `lsx_calloc` macro (which wraps `malloc`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The integer overflow leads to an incorrect size being passed to `lsx_calloc`.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When `lsx_calloc` returns a NULL pointer (due to a failed allocation), this pointer is used without validation, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in `formats_i.c` when accessing `lsx_readbuf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** A NULL pointer dereference will cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted input file:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input file to `sox` that causes the integer overflow to occur during processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `sox` utility. This would likely involve using a specifically crafted file as an input to the `sox` command.
