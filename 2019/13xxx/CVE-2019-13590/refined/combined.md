                 CVE-2021-23210 CVE-2021-33844 CVE-2021-40426 CVE-2022-31650

Debian Bug     : 933372 1010374 1012138 1012516 1021133 1021134 1021135

This update fixes multiple file format validation vulnerabilities that could
result in memory access violations such as buffer overflows and floating point
exceptions. It also fixes a regression in hcom parsing introduced when fixing
CVE-2017-11358.

CVE-2019-13590

    In sox-fmt.h (startread function), there is an integer overflow on the
    result of integer addition (wraparound to 0) fed into the lsx_calloc macro
    that wraps malloc. When a NULL pointer is returned, it is used without a
    prior check that it is a valid pointer, leading to a NULL pointer
    dereference on lsx_readbuf in formats_i.c.

CVE-2021-3643

    The lsx_adpcm_init function within libsox leads to a
    global-buffer-overflow. This flaw allows an attacker to input a malicious
    file, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.

CVE-2021-23159

    A vulnerability was found in SoX, where a heap-buffer-overflow occurs
    in function lsx_read_w_buf() in formats_i.c file. The vulnerability is
    exploitable with a crafted file, that could cause an application to
    crash.

CVE-2021-23172

    A vulnerability was found in SoX, where a heap-buffer-overflow occurs
    in function startread() in hcom.c file. The vulnerability is
    exploitable with a crafted hcomn file, that could cause an application
    to crash.

CVE-2021-23210

    A floating point exception (divide-by-zero) issue was discovered in
    SoX in functon read_samples() of voc.c file. An attacker with a
    crafted file, could cause an application to crash.

CVE-2021-33844

    A floating point exception (divide-by-zero) issue was discovered in
    SoX in functon startread() of wav.c file. An attacker with a crafted
    wav file, could cause an application to crash.

CVE-2021-40426

    A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the sphere.c
    start_read() functionality of Sound Exchange libsox. A specially-crafted
    file can lead to a heap buffer overflow. An attacker can provide a
    malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-31650

    There is a floating-point exception in lsx_aiffstartwrite in aiff.c.

CVE-2022-31651

    There is an assertion failure in rate_init in rate.c.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
14.4.2+git20190427-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
