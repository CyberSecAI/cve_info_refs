The content is related to CVE-2019-13555.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled resource consumption in the FTP service of affected Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC-Q and MELSEC-L Series CPU modules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The FTP service on the specified CPU modules is vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption. A remote attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by connecting to the FTP server at a specific timing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation prevents the FTP client from connecting to the FTP server on the affected CPU modules, causing a denial of service. Only the FTP server function is affected.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the affected CPU module and be able to connect to its FTP server. The attack requires low skill level to exploit.
