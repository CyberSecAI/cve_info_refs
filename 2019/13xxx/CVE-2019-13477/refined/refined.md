Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-13477:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from a combination of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2019-13476) and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2019-13477). The XSS allows injecting malicious code, which then leverages the CSRF to perform unauthorized actions, in this case, changing a user's password without needing the current password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new email mailbox, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'domain' parameter.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The password change functionality does not properly validate the request origin, enabling an attacker to forge a request to change the victim's password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account takeover:** By combining XSS and CSRF, an attacker can change a victim's password without knowing the current password. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the victim's account.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the victim is a privileged user, such as the root user, the attacker can gain full administrative access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Payload Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious XSS payload into the "domain" parameter when creating a new mailbox. This payload is stored by the application.
- **CSRF Trigger:** When a victim user (e.g., the root user) accesses the email accounts section of the control panel, the stored XSS payload is executed. This payload then triggers a request to the password change functionality, without the user's knowledge, changing the victim's password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the control panel:** The attacker needs access to the control panel as a normal user.
- **Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, for example, by using a tool like Burp Suite.
- **Social Engineering (optional):** While not strictly required, an attacker could use social engineering tactics to entice a victim user to access a specific page of the control panel where the malicious payload is stored and subsequently triggered.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in CWP (Control Web Panel) version 0.9.8.837 and fixed in version 0.9.8.851.
- The PoC involves injecting the XSS payload, then having a victim user (e.g. root) browse to the email accounts page, where the injected XSS will be triggered. The XSS will execute a PHP script which modifies the password without requiring the old password.
