Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13513:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DPA files in Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data from memory locations outside of the allocated buffer. Specifically, the read occurs either before the start or after the end of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the DOPSoft process.
- Information disclosure: The out-of-bounds read may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- Application crash: The vulnerability can cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The attack requires user interaction: The target user must either visit a malicious page or open a specially crafted malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious DPA file that triggers the out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsed by DOPSoft.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page, which can be done via social engineering attacks.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2019-03-27.
- Delta Industrial Automation has released an update to address this issue.
- The vulnerability affects DOPSoft Version 4.00.06.15 and prior.
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.8, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact, with low attack complexity and user interaction required.

It should be noted that some sources mention "read before the start of an allocated buffer", while one source mentions "read after the end of an allocated buffer". This suggests that the vulnerability involves a buffer overflow/underflow, where data is read from outside of the allocated memory range, either below or above it, due to improper bounds checking.
