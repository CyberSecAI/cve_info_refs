Based on the provided information, the content is relevant to CVE-2019-13375.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated SQL Command Injection
*   **Affected Product:** D-Link Central WiFi Manager (CWM-100) before Ver. 1.03R0100- Beta6
*   **Root Cause:** The file `/web/Public/Conn.php` lacks session verification, allowing unauthenticated attackers to directly access and call the database query interface to execute arbitrary SQL statements.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/Public/Conn.php` with `dbAction=S` and a malicious `dbSQL` parameter.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers can obtain any data in the database, including admin usernames and passwords (though the passwords are MD5-encrypted).
    *   Attackers can add a new administrator account with a known password.
*   **Vulnerable CGI:** `/web/Public/Conn.php`
*   **POC:**
    ```
