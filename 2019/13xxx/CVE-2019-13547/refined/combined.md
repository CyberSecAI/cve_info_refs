#### 3.2.1    [IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

Path traversal vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to use in file operations. An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to remotely execute code while posing as an administrator.

[CVE-2019-13551](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-13551) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [MISSING AUTHORIZATION CWE-862](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html)

There is an unsecured function that allows anyone who can access the IP address to use the function without authentication.

[CVE-2019-13547](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-13547) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

[CVE-2019-18227](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-18227) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N))

#### 3.2.4    [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SPECIAL ELEMENTS USED IN AN SQL COMMAND ('SQL INJECTION') CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

Lack of sanitization of user-supplied input cause SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to disclose information.

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

rgod of 9sg Security Team and trendytofu working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Advantech phased out WISE-PaaS/RMM in July of 2019 and replaced this product with EdgeSense and DeviceOn. Advantech has provided notification to their PSM’s, sales managers, RSM’s and partners of the phase out to replace the old WISE-PaaS/RMM software bundle with EdgeSense and DeviceOn.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Ensure the least-privilege user principle is followed.
* Monitor or block Port 1880/TCP.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
