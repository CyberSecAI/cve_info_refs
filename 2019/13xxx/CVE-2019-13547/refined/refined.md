Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication check in the NodeRed Server component of Advantech WISE-PaaS/RMM. Specifically, the NodeRed server listens on TCP port 1880 by default and allows alterations to system configurations without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Authorization (CWE-862): The application lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated access to functions that should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with SYSTEM privileges.
- System Compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the system, including unauthorized access, data manipulation, and denial of service.
- Information Disclosure: As this vulnerability is part of a group with other vulnerabilities (path traversal, XXE, SQL Injection), exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network access to the vulnerable service running on TCP port 1880.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the target system running the vulnerable Advantech WISE-PaaS/RMM software on TCP port 1880.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
