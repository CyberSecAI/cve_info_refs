  "CVE-2019-13305": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has a stack-based buffer overflow at coders/pnm.c in WritePNMImage because of a misplaced strncpy and an off-by-one error.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a combination of a misplaced `strncpy` call and an off-by-one error in the `WritePNMImage` function when writing PNM image files.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to a misplaced strncpy and an off-by-one error."
    ],
    "Impact": "Exploitation could lead to denial of service, memory corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PNM image file.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PNM file to a system using ImageMagick for processing. No special privileges are required.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability stems from how ImageMagick handles the writing of pixel data into a buffer allocated on the stack. Due to a combination of a misplaced strncpy and an off-by-one error, the buffer can be overflown."
  },
  "CVE-2019-13304": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has a stack-based buffer overflow at coders/pnm.c in WritePNMImage because of a misplaced assignment.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a misplaced assignment within the `WritePNMImage` function in `coders/pnm.c`, which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow when processing PNM image files.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to a misplaced assignment."
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit could result in denial of service, memory corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PNM image file using ImageMagick.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker must be able to supply a malicious PNM image file to an application or service using ImageMagick.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs because the code is writing data into a stack buffer without correctly tracking the remaining space. Specifically, there is a misplaced assignment that results in the buffer being overflown. This can lead to memory corruption, a crash, or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the application using ImageMagick."

    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to off-by-one errors."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could result in a denial-of-service, memory corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PNM image file with ImageMagick.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to provide a malicious PNM file for processing with ImageMagick. No special privileges are required.",
      "Additional details":"The buffer overflow is caused by incorrect size calculations when writing pixel data to a buffer on the stack. The buffer can be overflowed by one or more bytes due to the off-by-one errors."

 "CVE-2019-13307": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has a heap-based buffer overflow at MagickCore/statistic.c in EvaluateImages because of mishandling rows.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to mishandling of rows within the `EvaluateImages` function in `MagickCore/statistic.c`.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to mishandling of rows."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service, memory corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted image file using the vulnerable function.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to supply a specially crafted image file designed to trigger the buffer overflow. No special privileges are required.",
        "Additional details": "The mishandling of rows in the image processing leads to writing data beyond the allocated heap buffer, causing the overflow. The specific conditions that trigger the vulnerability involve the dimensions and contents of the image being processed."

    "Attacker capabilities": "Attacker must be able to provide a malicious image file to ImageMagick for processing.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is located in the `EvaluateImages` function. By crafting an image with specific properties, the attacker can trigger the heap-based buffer overflow."
