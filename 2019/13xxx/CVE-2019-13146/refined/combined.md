## Package

bundler

field\_test
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

= 0.3.0

## Patched versions

0.3.1

## Description

The field\_test gem 0.3.0 for Ruby has unvalidated input. A method call that is expected to return a value from a certain set of inputs can be made to return any input, which can be dangerous depending on how applications use it. If an application treats arbitrary variants as trusted, this can lead to a variety of potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@ankane](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220358?u=ba13f3240d7992dc4124a33a4fc65bf4924e5375&v=4&size=48)[ankane](https://github.com/ankane)opened [on Jul 2, 2019](https://github.com/ankane/field_test/issues/17#issue-462962501)

Due to unvalidated input, an attacker can pass in arbitrary variants via query parameters. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2019-13146](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wg9m-gw3h-hg83 "CVE-2019-13146").

Versions Affected: 0.3.0

Fixed Versions: 0.3.1

Versions Unaffected: < 0.3.0

## Impact

If an application treats variants as trusted, this can lead to a variety of potential vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). For instance:

```
landing_page = field_test(:landing_page)
Page.where("key = '#{landing_page}'")
```

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.
