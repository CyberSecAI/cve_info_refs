Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication for a critical function in the web configuration interface of the affected Siemens SCALANCE X switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306):** The web interface allows access to certain functionalities without requiring authentication. This allows an attacker to bypass access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the device.
*   **Configuration Changes:** The attacker could alter the device configuration, potentially disrupting normal operations or creating further security vulnerabilities.
*   **Violation of access-control rules:** An unauthenticated attacker can violate access-control rules.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker who has network access to the affected switch.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a GET request to a specific URL on the device's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the affected device on the network.
*  **Unauthenticated Access**: The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory notes that at the time of publication, no public exploits targeting this vulnerability were known.
*   The advisory recommends updating to specific firmware versions to remediate the vulnerability.
*   Workarounds include configuring Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict access to the web interface and disabling web-based management in favor of SSH.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8.
*   The affected devices are SCALANCE X switches used in industrial environments.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Maxim Rupp.
