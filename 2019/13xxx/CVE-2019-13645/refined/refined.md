## Analysis of CVE-2019-13645

The provided content describes a Stored XSS vulnerability in Firefly III version 4.7.17.2 (CVE-2019-13645).

### Root Cause

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data in file names when attachments are uploaded. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the filename of an uploaded image.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities

*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database as part of the filename and executed when a user interacts with the attachment.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize the filename during the upload process.

### Impact of Exploitation

Successful exploitation leads to Stored XSS. When a user edits the attachment, the malicious JavaScript in the filename is executed in the user's browser. This can lead to:

*   **Account Takeover:** Attacker steals user credentials or session tokens.
*   **Data Theft:** Attacker accesses sensitive information displayed within the application.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attacker performs unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Defacement:** Attacker modifies the appearance or content of the application.

### Attack Vectors

1.  **Upload Malicious File:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file with a malicious JavaScript payload in its name.
2.  **Edit Attachment:** When a user navigates to the attachment edit page, the JavaScript code in the filename is executed.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to upload attachments.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Firefly III instance.
*   **Bypass Filename Restrictions:** The attacker needs to either use a Linux system or a proxy to bypass filename restrictions when creating the malicious filename.

### Technical Details

*   The vulnerability occurs when editing an attachment at `http://firefly.host/attachments/edit/$file_id$`.
*   The attacker crafts a filename like `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`.
*   The vulnerable code is in the handling of attachment filenames.
