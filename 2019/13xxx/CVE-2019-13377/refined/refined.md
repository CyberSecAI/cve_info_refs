Based on the provided texts, here's information regarding CVE-2019-13377:

*   **Vulnerability:** Timing-based side-channel attack against WPA3's Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves. This vulnerability is present in wpa\_supplicant and hostapd.

*   **Root Cause:** The password encoding algorithm of Dragonfly using Brainpool curves has a timing leak. An attacker can measure the timing differences to leak information.

*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit the timing differences in the Dragonfly handshake.

*   **Impact:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve the password. An attacker can bruteforce the Wi-Fi password.

*   **Affected software:** hostapd and wpa\_supplicant.

*   **Affected versions:**
    *   Debian: affects wpa versions prior to the fixes in oldstable (stretch) and stable (buster).
    *   Ubuntu: affects wpa\_supplicant and hostapd. Patches are available for Ubuntu 19.04 and 18.04 ESM.
    *   Red Hat: Not affected, because RHEL 5, 6, 7 and 8 are not compiled with SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) nor with EAP-pwd enabled.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ubuntu: Update the system to the specified package versions.
    *   The fix involves using `const_time_memcmp()` for `pwd_value >= prime` comparison, using `BN_bn2binpad()` or `BN_bn2bin_padded()` if available, running through prf result processing even if it >= prime, disallowing ECC groups with a prime under 256 bits, and disabling use of groups using Brainpool curves.

*   **Additional details:** Setting Attack Complexity (AC) to High because an attacker needs the password to be weak for the dictionary attack to succeed, which is not under the attacker control.
