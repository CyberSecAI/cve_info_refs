{
  "CVE-2019-13106": {
    "Description": "Das U-Boot versions 2016.09 through 2019.07-rc4 can memset() too much data while reading a crafted ext4 filesystem, which results in a stack buffer overflow and likely code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The `ext4fs_read_file` function in `ext4fs.c` doesn't properly check the number of bytes to be zeroed using memset, leading to a stack buffer overflow when a filename (or another structure) crosses a block boundary in a crafted ext4 filesystem. The number of bytes to write is determined by `n = blocksize - skipfirst` where skipfirst is the start offset, this value isn't checked against remaining length, and a `memset` operation with 'n' bytes is done.  If the filename crosses a block boundary, the number of zero bytes can exceed the allocated buffer on the stack, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
     ],
    "Impact": "A stack buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, which can defeat verified boot.",
    "Attack vector": "By loading a crafted ext4 filesystem.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to load a crafted ext4 filesystem. No specific privileges are required."
