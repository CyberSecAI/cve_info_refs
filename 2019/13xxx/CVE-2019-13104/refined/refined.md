{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An integer underflow in the `ext4fs_read_file` function, when calculating the length of data to copy from an ext4 filesystem, can result in memcpy being called with a negative length, causing it to write an extremely large amount of data to memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer underflow leading to out-of-bounds memory access via memcpy.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption leading to a denial of service and potential code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when reading a crafted ext4 filesystem.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious ext4 filesystem to be processed by the vulnerable U-Boot version."
