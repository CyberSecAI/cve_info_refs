Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control, where a user with access to a project, but not the repository, could discover merge request template names through brute-force techniques.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed the disclosure of merge request template names, which should have been restricted to users with repository access.
- **Broken Access Control:** The system failed to properly enforce access control restrictions, allowing unauthorized users to enumerate these template names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Exposure:** An attacker could discover merge request template names, potentially gaining insight into the project's workflow or internal processes.
- **Limited Direct Impact:** While the information disclosure is a security concern, it does not seem to directly allow arbitrary code execution or other major security breaches. The primary impact seems to be the exposure of project metadata.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Brute-force:** The attacker can make a large number of requests to discover template names through brute-force techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Project Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the project in order to exploit this vulnerability but does not require access to the repository.

**Affected Versions:**
- GitLab EE 8.11.0 and later are affected.
