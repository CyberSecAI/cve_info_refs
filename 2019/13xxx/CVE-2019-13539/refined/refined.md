Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-13539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The affected Medtronic products utilize the `descrypt` algorithm for operating system password hashing. This algorithm is considered weak and reversible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reversible One-Way Hash (CWE-328):** The use of a reversible hashing algorithm for passwords makes them susceptible to cracking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   If an attacker gains local shell access to the device (which can be achieved through other vulnerabilities mentioned in the document), they can extract the password hashes. These hashes can then be reversed, allowing the attacker to obtain the plaintext passwords.
* Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the system due to gained access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector requires local shell access to the device. This access can be obtained by exploiting other vulnerabilities like hardcoded credentials or improper input validation.
*  The device's network connections are disabled by default, but network connectivity is often enabled

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local shell access:** An attacker needs to have a local shell on the device to extract password hashes. This requires some level of compromise through other means.
* **Low Privileges:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability with low privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.0, with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The document notes that network-based logons are disabled, so the hashes must be accessed locally after exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
* This vulnerability is one of three identified in the advisory, which together allow for remote code execution.
