The provided content describes a security issue in the Directus v8-archive project, which is related to the file upload mechanism and corresponds to CVE-2019-13984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The file upload mechanism allows direct access to uploaded files without authentication. It also lacks restrictions on file extensions and mime types.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unauthenticated direct file access:**  Uploaded files can be accessed directly via a URL without any authentication.
*   **Lack of file extension/mime type validation:**  The system does not enforce any restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded.
*   **Large file size limits:**  Large files (up to 50MB) can be uploaded, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Malware distribution:** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., spyware, malware) and distribute them via a legitimate link, exploiting user trust in the system.
*   **Denial of service:** Uploading large files can exhaust storage space or negatively impact other web application functions.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **File upload:** Attackers can upload malicious files through the vulnerable file upload mechanism.
*   **Direct URL access:** Attackers can share direct links to the uploaded files, which can be accessed without authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to upload a file through the application's file upload functionality. No special privileges or positions are mentioned beyond that, making it a likely case of unauthenticated upload.
