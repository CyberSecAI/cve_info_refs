Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-13585

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `vrimserve.exe` application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `vrimserve.exe` application, which provides an HTTP service on TCP port 8090 for controlling virtual robots and viewing log files, has a vulnerable log viewer functionality.
- The vulnerability arises from insufficient bounds checking when handling HTTP requests related to log viewing.
- Specifically, a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long path can trigger a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted HTTP request, an attacker can crash the `vrimserve.exe` application, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the EIP register, which could lead to remote code execution, although this was not confirmed by the researchers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable web server running on TCP port 8090. The request targets the log viewer functionality.
- Specifically, the attacker sends a long request to an arbitrary path like: `/namedrobots/folder/dir/` with 1268 bytes of padding and then control the EIP register with the byte sequence `BBBBCCCCCCCCC`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the machine running the vulnerable `vrimserve.exe` application, specifically to port 8090.
- The attacker needs the ability to send custom HTTP requests.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable application is a 32-bit application.
- The PoC exploit developed by SySS GmbH specifically overwrites the EIP register.
- The vulnerability was found in FANUC Robotics Virtual Robot Controller, version V8.23.
- The vendor has not released a security update as of the disclosure date.
