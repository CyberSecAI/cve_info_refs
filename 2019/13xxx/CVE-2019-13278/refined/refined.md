{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The TRENDNet TEW-827DRU router allows unauthenticated access to its setup wizard functionality. Within the wizard, user-supplied values for various parameters are directly injected into system commands through `sprintf` and `_system` calls without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection: User-controlled data is used to construct shell commands.",
       "Unauthenticated Access: The vulnerable setup wizard functionality is accessible without authentication."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the router's operating system, leading to complete control of the device, including the ability to open reverse shells and potentially expose the local network to further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to the vulnerable wizard functionality. Specifically, the scripts target the following cgi endpoints:",
       "`do_wizard_wan_l2tp_cgi`, `do_wizard_wan_pptp_cgi`, and processing of MAC address after setting DHCP WAN parameters."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router on the network."
  },
    "affected_product": {
        "vendor": "TRENDNet",
        "product": "TEW-827DRU H/W 2.0",
         "version": "F/W 2.04"
    },
  "additional_details": "The provided exploit scripts (wizard_l2tp_cmdinj.py, wizard_mac_cmdinj.py, and wizard_pptp_cmdinj.py) demonstrate the vulnerability and inject a command to flush iptable rules and establish a telnet server for a reverse shell.  The vulnerable parameters vary depending on the script. Parameters such as `system.@system[0].hostname`, `cameo.wan.wan_mac` and other related variables are directly injected into the command string.",
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-13278"
