# Linux Mint encryption

25 Jan 2015

In my [previous post](/2014/05/23/luks-full-disk-encryption/) on full disk encryption I described how to avoid having to enter your passphrase twice. That method, however, only works on Arch. Here’s how to do it on Linux Mint[1](#fn:mint).

The initial setup process (with LVM, LUKS and GRUB) is the same as on Arch, but instead of editing `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`, which doesn’t exist on Mint, create `/etc/crypttab`:

```
lvm /dev/sda1 none luks

```

So far, so good. The `crypttab` man page even talks about how you can point to a keyfile in the third column (“none” above). Unfortunately, if you do so, it doesn’t actually work. If you read the `cryptroot` script[2](#fn:script), you find that the keyfile is only ever used as an argument to a keyscript.

Oddly enough, although there are several provided scripts, each doing various exotic things, none of them seem to handle the simple case of using the key to just decrypt the drive.

What these scripts have in common is that they take the “keyfile” as an argument, and their output is used as the key. So, all we need to do is provide a “script” that will take a filename and output the file’s contents:

```
lvm /dev/sda1 /crypto_keyfile.bin luks,keyscript=/bin/cat

```

Now, the `cryptroot` hook[3](#fn:hook) will copy the `cat` executable into the ramdisk, and during boot `cat` will send the keyfile’s contents to `cryptsetup`.

All that’s left is to ensure the keyfile is available before the drive is decrypted by copying it into the ramdisk too. There’s no convenient `FILES` option like in Arch, so you’ll have to make a custom hook. Luckily, it’s trivial:

```
#!/bin/sh
cp /crypto_keyfile.bin "${DESTDIR}"

```

Put it in `/etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/` and make it executable:

```
chmod +x /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/crypto_keyfile

```

Recreate the ramdisk:

```
update-initramfs -u

```

Check that everything is where it should be with `lsinitramfs` and reboot.

> Update (02/08/15): Don’t forget that since the keyfile is stored on the ramdisk, you should make it only accessible by `root`, as well:
>
> ```
> chmod -R g-rwx,o-rwx /boot
>
> ```

# Introduction

One of the key factors to [system security](/CategorySystemSecurity) is access permissions control. All modern operating systems support this feature. It allows file owners to restrict who can read, write, execute and otherwise change files, running processes and other parts of the system.

Linux, as every UNIX-like OS, has a built-in file permission control system. It assigns the following attributes to every file on its [file system](/FileSystem):

* **owner** - user who owns the file, has unlimited control over it and can change other file attributes
* **group** - group the file belongs to
* **UNIX permissions** - a set of rules defining who can do what with the file

To see what user and group you are, run  id -a  in a [Shell](/Shell):

* **uid**: your user name and id
* **gid**: your primary group name and id
* **groups**: all other groups your user belongs to.

If a particular access permission is granted to one your groups, then it will be also be granted to you.

Your **effective** group id (taken into account when creating files and directories, as explained below), is most of the time set to your primary group id.

**Page refactoring in progress below this point**

**Used terms:**

*file system* - an on-disk structure holding descriptions of files (such as the attributes mentioned above, file modification date etc.) and the files' contents themselves. File systems are contained in disk **partitions** (also called **slices**). Some of the most popular file systems today are ext4, xfs and btrfs. If you run Debian, you probably use **ext4**. Worth mentioning is the fact that directories ('folders') are also considered files, simply containing other files. Therefore, permissions apply to directories, too.

*user group* - in UNIX-like systems, every user is assigned to some group(s). Users in the same group may share rights, for example a file's permissions may be set so that all users in a group can modify its contents.

# Section 2: UNIX permissions explained

Having learnt the theory, it's time to pass on to practice - what do UNIX file permissions look like and how to use them? First of all, let us examine the permissions of an example file. By issuing the following command in Linux console or a terminal emulator:

```
stat /etc/hostname
```

you will see a list of file's attributes. It includes file type (it could also be a directory, a symlink, etc.), file size et cetera and a line like the one quoted below, which is the item of our interest:

```
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)
```

This file is owned by the **root** user (system administrator) and belongs to the **root** group. Before the slash, numeric user IDs are shown - that's the way they are stored in the file system. The user and group names are retrieved by looking up the numeric IDs in the password and group databases.

The **Access** field contains an octal number and its human-readable representation (though some people consider the numeric one to be more readable). It is crucial to know what the permission number means. It consists of four digits, ranging from 0 to 7. For now, we shall skip the first one and focus on the last three, as they are used most commonly on every system. In our example, those are 644. Each digit may be a sum of 4, 2 and 1, but not every component has to be included, giving a possible range from 0 to 7. Below is the meaning of the sum components, with Subject being user, group or others, as discussed below.

* 4 - read permission. Subject is allowed to read the contents of the file or list the content of a directory. Directory content is more than the names of the files, sub-directories, and the other filesystem objects held within each directory; it also includes other meta-information such as whether the filesystem object is a file or directory, the permissions associated with the object, and so forth.
* 2 - write permission. Subject may modify file content. With directories, it allows the subject to modify what's recorded as being in the directory. This means being able to create files within the directory, or equivalently, move files into the directory; delete files from the directory, or equivalently, move files out of the directory; and, because the directory is where there's a record of the directory content, to modify the permissions of each file or sub-directory contained in the directory.
* 1 - execute permission. Subject may execute the file. Any file may be marked executable; when the content won't execute an error is reported at runtime. Likewise any file may have execution privileges removed; files with executable content but no permission to execute can't be run. In the case of directories, execute permission lets the subject traverse through the directory into sub-directories. Note that directory traversal does not require read permission. See the note on path handling below.

Therefore, number 5, for example, would mean: a permission to read and execute, but not to write.

The digits define respectively: owner, group and others' permissions. Therefore, we can see that, in our example, file owner (root) may write to the file and read its contents, while group 'root' and other users (not being root nor a member of group 'root') are given the right to read the file.

Now, compare it to file permissions of /etc/shadow (use 'stat' again). This file has 0 as the third meaningful digit, so users not being root nor in group 'shadow' may not even read the file. You can easily confirm that by running a text editor and trying to open /etc/shadow - you, as a regular user, should not be allowed to see its contents as it contains system-wide passwords (and this is beyond the scope of this little How To).

## Human-readable form

Several system tools and graphical programs recognize the idea of a human-readable form - a string of 10 consecutive characters. To see an example, issue the command below:
```
ls -l /etc
```

The -l flag tells ls to display file permissions in the left column of output. The full sequence that you might encounter is as follows (although you probably won't find such files in /etc):
```
-rwxrwxrwx+
```

Now, let's divide this into parts. The first character defines node type, which is **-** for normal file, **d** for a directory, **l** for symbolic link, **c** for a character device, **p** for a pseudo-terminal and **b** for a block device. You will find files, directories and links commonly throughout the filesystem, while devices and pseudo-terminals should only appear in /dev. Then we have 3 chunks, 3 characters each: rwx rwx rwx. They directly correspond to respective digits of permissions: if the permission is enabled, you get a letter, and if not, you get **-** in place of that letter. In this case, the first **rwx** means 7 to owner, the second is also 7 for owner's group, and the third is the world (others) permission. Thus, for example, 640 translates to:
```
rw-r-----
```

(rw- for owner, r-- for group, --- for others). The last column is the **+** sign. You are unlikely to see it while listing a directory now (it will appear empty), but it means that extended access rules are in effect, so the file's real permissions are not only what the file access mode says - you can read about ACL below in this howto.

**A note on path handling**

To access any path in the filesystem, the user (which the particular process is running as) needs at least execute privilege for all its parent directories. Therefore, if you try to access an **example file /etc/security/limits.conf**, even though it has a mode of **0755** (for the sake of example), it does not necessarily mean you are free to read it. To read the file, you have to be able to 'execute' all of its parent directories, so you need execute permission on /etc and /etc/security. If either /etc or /etc/security has permissions set so that you are not allowed to execute it (1), then reading /etc/security/limits.conf will fail. This rule applies anywhere in the filesystem.

## The defaults for new files and directories

This section is included primarily for reference and to aid understanding. Default permissions and group assignment are not often changed so it is safe to skim over this section and come back to re-read it for more detail should the need arise.

The permissions associated with newly created files and directories are, for the most part, determined by something called a umask. The umask is a 3 digit octal number and often prefixed with extra 0 to make it clear that it is a base 8 number. The value is subtracted from 0777 to produce the default permission associated with objects newly created in the filesystem. The umask of a 'stock' Debian system is 0002 or 0022 (depending on whether [user private groups](/UserPrivateGroups) are configured). For example 0022 makes the default permissions be 0755 -- the owner has all permissions, the group read and execute but not write, and everybody else can read and execute but not write. One would then expect all newly created files to be marked executable but this is prevented because the system call that creates files defaults to creating files that are not executable. Directories on the other hand do have their execute bit set, umask permitting, and so by default can be traversed by all.

The shell umask command can be used to display the current umask (without any arguments) or to change its value, see [bash-builtins(7) § umask](https://manpages.debian.org/man/bash-builtins#umask "DebianMan").
```
$ umask
0022
$ (umask 0077; touch private.log)
$ echo 'default' >default.log
$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 test test 8 Jul 30 10:24 default.log
-rw------- 1 test test 0 Jul 30 10:24 private.log
```

Spawned process inherits umask value from its parent and may change it using the [umask(2)](https://manpages.debian.org/man/2/umask "DebianMan") system call. See the [Setting default umask](/Permissions#Setting_default_umask) section below how to configure default umask.

The user uid (user id number) associated with a newly created file or directory is that of the running process effective uid. In most cases this is the uid of the user who logged in and started the process.

The group associated with a newly created file or directory is the effective group of the running process. This is normally the group named with the username of the logged in user, but can be manually changed (along with the "real" group) on a per-process basis with the newgrp command although this is rarely done.

The first of the 4 octal digits which represent permissions contains the setuid and setgid bits. These can be used to override some of the defaults described above but it is not worth getting into details other than to note that the [user private groups](/UserPrivateGroups) project collaboration idiom (see below) depends on the behavior of the setgid bit.

# Section 3: Modifying file permissions

This section shows, using an example, the very basic usage of **chmod** command. Chmod is one of sysadmin's best friends and the standard tool for manipulating file permissions in various Unices (also works with \*BSD and Solaris!). Let's begin... First of all, create a file for demonstration purposes. In the example, I will be using name **testfile**. Commands below are to be executed in a terminal emulator or Linux console. You can just copy and paste, and see how it works.

```
# first of all, create the file using touch command (see 'man touch' for details)
touch testfile
# now, let's see its permissions
stat testfile
# modify the file so that group members and other users can write to it
chmod 666 testfile
# see the new permissions
stat testfile
```

There is a special case: to clear special bits with directories, you must mention the file mode bits explicitly (in symbolic mode) or by operator numeric mode (in octal description) (see more with: 'info coreutils, section 27.5 "Directories and the Set-User-ID and Set-Group-ID Bits")

Have the file permissions changed? You can verify that it actually worked by starting a new session and logging on to another user account, or issuing **su *username***. If you only have one user account, create a new one for testing:

```
su
(your root password here, to log on to root account and add a test user)
adduser demo
# you can remove this user when you've finished: deluser demo
```

Now, log on to demo, open testfile (in your regular user's home directory) and type something in it. Save, and then check with your own user's account that it contains whatever you may have written. Voila! You may now want to check it with various different permissions. Try chmod with arguments like 644, 640 and so on.

# Section 4: Example scenarios involving chmod

You now know how to change file permissions. However, how can they be useful in real life besides letting your buddy leave you a random message in your own text files?

## Case 1: Family photos

**Situation:** You store family photos in directory Photos on your user account. Several other family members use the computer and you want them to be able to access the photos.

**Question:** How to set directory permissions so that other users can see your files and their content?

**Answer:** Set the directory to 755 and all files under it to 644:

```
chmod 755 Photos
# Photos/* means all files in Photos directory
chmod 0644 Photos/*
```

## Case 2: Software and data files for your department at work

* Note on below: **~** means your home directory.

**Situation:** In your home directory you have a program in ~/AppSoftware/program.bin . It stores your department-specific data files in ~/OurData. The system operator has assigned you and other people in your department a user group 'mydept'. You want other people from your department to be able to run the provided software and to write the data files. At the same time, other people from outside the group **should be allowed** to run the software **but not** to modify the data. For simplicity's sake, we skip things like logging who added/removed what in terms of data (logging is a necessity in real life), focusing only on appropriate permissions.

**Question:** How to allow execute access for a group to one file (program binary) and read-write access to other directory for the same group, while denying world (other users) access?

**Answer:** In our example, this would be:

```
# below: -R flag, affects the directory and files/subdirs inside
chmod -R 0755 ~/AppSoftware
chmod -R 0770 ~/OurData
```

In case files have a wrong group attribute set, you can correct it by first running **chgrp -R *mydept files***, where 'mydept' is the group name, 'files' is file path, and -R switch tells chgrp to run recursively (see above code example). Chgrp changes files' group to the one given.

## Case 3: Classified files

**Question:** How to protect files that are to be kept secret?

**Answer:** A very basic protection can be achieved by chmodding the sensitive files/directories to 0600. However, remember that the system administrator (root) can still access them, regardless of set file permissions. Therefore, besides locking down file permissions, it is highly advisable that you encrypt the files using strong encryption software (try OpenPGP encryption via programs like KGpg, or see ccrypt - symmetric cryptography).

# Group file sharing scenarios and the limits of basic UNIX permissions

Examples above show the usefulness of UNIX file permissions. You can grant users from your group access to your files, expose them to the whole world or have them only for yourself. However, there are use cases in which this access control model is not enough. Assume that you are on a large system (perhaps a server) and, together with several dozen users you are members of group 'users'. Now, you want to make some of your files available to just one of them so that the others can not read it. How can UNIX permissions benefit you? You could use the [user private groups](/UserPrivateGroups) directory sharing idiom; a common solution to this problem. But the user private groups idiom pushes the UNIX permission system to its limits and there are cases, even simple file sharing cases between 2 people, where the idiom is simply not suitable.

When the limits of basic UNIX file permissions are reached it is time to make use of...
# Access Control Lists in Linux

Access Control Lists (called ACL) are an extended means of defining access rights to files and objects. They allow you to specify file permissions in a more fine-grained way, assigning any user or group (besides owner and file's set group) different privileges. For instance, you may share a file with just one specific user, no matter what group they are in. How to make use of this new, powerful feature?

**First, make sure your system supports ACL**. Several criteria must be met before you can enable ACL for your files. Check your kernel version. If it is anything later than 2.6.18, then chances are you already have ACL support built-in. (I'm not quite certain at which version Debian kernels received the ACL patch). The next thing is [acl](https://packages.debian.org/acl "DebPkg") package, required for ACL attribute manipulation. You can install it by issuing:

```
 # if you are not logged on as root, use 'su' first
apt-get install acl
```

Alternatively, you can use Synaptic package manager, or another package manager, to get and install the package. If you are not the system administrator, ask your sysadmin to enable ACL on your machine.

Once you have installed **acl**, you can try and see if your file system supports it. Example command (I assume that file 'testfile' exists):

```
setfacl --modify user:demo:5 testfile
```

If setfacl complains about an error, you probably need to mount your filesystem with **acl** option. Assuming that the filesystem 'testfile' is located on is / , execute the below as **root**:

```
mount -o remount,acl /
```

Try **setfacl** again. If successful, a call to:

```
getfacl testfile
```

should show, among others, a line like this:

**user:demo:r-x**

Here, **rx** means 'read, execute' permission, which is equivalent to **5**. To see if Access Control Lists work, set the file permissions on testfile to 700 using chmod and try to open it from 'demo' user account. If successful, ACL did override UNIX permissions indeed. Your file system is now ready for granular access control with ACL!

*Note: To enable ACL permanently for certain filesystems, you should include **acl** option in /etc/fstab. Please refer to fstab(5) manual page for instructions.*

Example uses of setfacl to manage file permissions

```
setfacl -R -m user:josh:6 filedir   # sets read-write permissions for josh on filedir and all its contents
setfacl -m group:junior-sys-admins:4 /var/log/apache2/error.log    # let group members of junior-sys-admins read Apache2 error log file
setfacl -m user:evilcraig:0 my_notes.txt    # prevent user evilcraig from accessing my_notes.txt
```

## Default (inherited) ACL

Note: a bug in coreutils commands cp and mv limits the scope of the below to pure file creation, e.g. with touch: with copy and move, the "Default mask" of the target parent directory won't be inherited as the "Access mask" for the copied/moved file/directory: <http://debbugs.gnu.org/db/85/8527.html>

Default ACL are an invaluable tool when making a directory that you want to share for reading or writing among users. This hint is inspired by this thread on the Debian forums: <http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=53591>

Default ACL are access control entries that get inherited by all sub-items of a directory (recursion deeper is allowed!). Thus, if you want to create a directory for **bob** and **fred** so that both can work on each other's files, the below should suffice (notice the -d flag to setfacl, it sets a default ACL):

```
mkdir common_workspace
setfacl -m u:bob:7 common_workspace
setfacl -d -m u:bob:7 common_workspace
setfacl -m u:fred:7 common_workspace
setfacl -d -m u:fred:7 common_workspace
```

Note to the above: a default ACL is inherited by all child nodes as an ACL entry and default ACL, but a default ACL on its own **does not take any action permission-wise** - hence the double command. The first call gives user 'bob' the right to write, read and execute the directory, and the second one sets up the default ACL which will be inherited.

Now, whenever a file gets created, it retains its original owner and group, but should automatically get assigned the above ACL. This is, for example, useful when you have users co-working on website development. You can use Apache or PHP running as www-data, write a script to change file ownership upon creation to www-data (inotify helps!), and all files are still writable by bob and fred, your Web developers.

## Appendix: Some hints

* On Debian systems, every user is traditionally assigned their own group. File sharing may be accomplished by adding one user to other's group, as shown below (only to be done as root):

```
  adduser me otherguy # adds user 'me' to group 'otherguy'
```

Then, 'otherguy' can just set their files to 07**5**0 or whatever permissions they want you to have. However, this is the old-fashioned approach to granular file permissions and should be avoided whenever possible in favour of [user private groups](/UserPrivateGroups) or ACLs.

* Konqueror (at least in Debian Squeeze) supports ACL out-of-the-box when filesystems are mounted with **acl** option. It allows for easy, graphical management of extended access rights, similar to that of Microsoft Windows.
* Sometimes you have to mount a filesystem that does not support ACL. For example, a NFS volume exported by a central storage solution, or an userspace zfs diskset. In these situations, you can try one simple solution: <http://cintrabatista.net/nfs_with_posix_acl.html>
* You can find a wonderful but pretty old (still current, though) ACL guide here: <http://www.vanemery.com/Linux/ACL/linux-acl.html>

That's all! Have fun and thanks for bearing with me.

# Setting default umask

<https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/ch04s11.en.html#idm1514> - Setting users umasks in *Securing Debian Manual*

Umask affects [permissions for new files and directories](/Permissions#The_defaults_for_new_files_and_directories). Examples of wide spread values:

* 022 is the default for Debian 12 bookworm and earlier. It is reasonable balance for cooperation with other users. Files may be read and executed by other users, but they can not modify content. Unfortunately users have to explicitly make files group-writable inside shared directories.
* 002 is suitable for active usage of shared directories. It requires configuration of [user private groups](/UserPrivateGroups) (enabled by default) and dangerous for users having no own group. If user primary group is not their private group then all members of that group (e.g. a whole department) have chance to modify almost any user's file, in some cases it applies to whole home directory. Pay attention to [security consideration](/UserPrivateGroups#Security_Considerations) and [CAUTION](/UserPrivateGroups#CAUTION) sections of the article on user private groups. Since Debian Trixie it is default for users with proper primary group and 022 otherwise. Debian 12 bookworm requires explicit pam\_umask configuration with usergroups option (see below).
* 077 or 007 may be appropriate for users seeking privacy when other users should not be able to read files, maybe besides a specific group.

Citing /etc/login.defs: "There is no One True Answer here: each sysadmin must make up his/her mind". You may find some links to discussions in [Debate/umask](/Debate/umask).

Setting umask is similar to configuring [EnvironmentVariables](/EnvironmentVariables) in some aspects and adding umask 077 to ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc may not be enough despite you may notice this recipe in various guides. In the past umask for all users were set in the /etc/profile file, but it was changed in 2010 ([#583967](https://bugs.debian.org/583967 "DebianBug")), so use PAM instead.

## System-wide umask configuration

Be careful if you decide to change default umask value. Restrictive value may make files or directories not readable or writable by users who should have access. The worst case is broken applications that could not read config files. The opposite case is group write bit not cleared by umask combined with inappropriate default group.

* System administrator often create files that must be world readable. Pay attention that umask for root is overridden by 022 for all ways to acquire privileges:

  su with and without -/--login option, [sudo](/sudo) with various options like -i/--login, sudoedit, ssh, virtual terminal.
* Setting umask 022 in ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc is not enough since e.g. sudo may execute commands directly with no shell involved.
* With restrictive umask explicit chmod may be required to make files accessible for e.g. web server.

Since Debian 12 Bookworm home directories for users are created with 0700 permissions by default, so most of user files are protected despite default permissive umask. Permissions of earlier created directories may be changed in the same way. As an alternative to umask it is not ideal. Files created in /tmp are not protected unless every application explicitly sets umask or permissions. In some cases home directory must be traversible for other users. Examples are ~/public\_html for Apache and unprivileged LXC containers. Possible solutions are [access control lists](/Permissions#Access_Control_Lists_in_Linux) or world execute bit without read one for the home directory.

System-wide umask is configured in the /etc/login.defs file. Read comments there and [login.defs(5)](https://manpages.debian.org/man/login.defs "DebianMan").
```
UMASK           077
```

In Debian 12 Bookworm and earlier releases, [pam\_umask(8)](https://manpages.debian.org/man/pam_umask "DebianMan") is missing in PAM configuration. As a result, the value specified in etc/login.defs is not applied. Because of this, umask is not reset when a user executes e.g. su - to run some commands as administrator. This group of bugs is fixed in Trixie (see e.g. [583958](https://bugs.debian.org/583958 "DebianBug")).

To fix this locally, check that the /etc/pam.d/common-session and /etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive files contain
```
session optional pam_umask.so usergroups
```

and add the line otherwise. In Trixie usergroups may be omitted, it is default set through a build option.

Consider setting HOME\_MODE in /etc/login.defs as well since otherwise UMASK affects permissions for home directories created by [useradd(8)](https://manpages.debian.org/man/useradd "DebianMan"). In Debian however the recommended tool is [adduser(8)](https://manpages.debian.org/man/adduser "DebianMan") that ignores login.defs and reads [adduser.conf(5)](https://manpages.debian.org/man/adduser.conf "DebianMan") instead. (With default settings adduser and adduser create home directories with different permissions.)

## Per-user umask settings

Depending on login type and the way a particular process is started the following options may be applied:

* umask 007 shell built-in placed in ~/.profile or an equivalent file for virtual terminal or ssh login. In the case of graphical login some [display managers](/DisplayManager), e.g. [SDDM](/SDDM) may read this file as well.
* umask 007 shell built-in in an [Xsession](/Xsession) file, e.g. ~/.xsessionrc for graphical login and X11 session.
* UMask=007 systemd directive from [Service] section, see [systemd.exec(5) § PROCESS PROPERTIES](https://manpages.debian.org/man/systemd.exec#PROCESS_PROPERTIES "DebianMan") for processes started by systemd. It is applied to some processes for any login type. Some desktop environments may start all application as or from services that belong to systemd user session.
* [systemd-homed(8)](https://manpages.debian.org/man/systemd-homed "DebianMan") has its own way to specify user's umask.

Have in mind that umask value may be preserved by su and sudo unless pam\_umask is enabled, see [System-wide umask configuration](/Permissions#System-wide_umask_configuration).

For processes started through system user session system administrator may create override files for specific UID's, e.g /etc/systemd/system/user@1000.service.d/umask.conf ([source](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/16963#issuecomment-689656886))
```
[Service]
UMask=0007
```

and run
```
systemctl daemon-reload
```

A user who cannot modify system files may drop the same file into ~/.config/systemd/user/service.d/ and it will be applied to all services in their user session; see [systemd.unit(5) § EXAMPLES](https://manpages.debian.org/man/systemd.unit#EXAMPLES "DebianMan"). It is necessary to log out and log in again to make this change effective. It is not enough systemctl --user daemon-reload, in addition running application launcher should be restarted as well. Use UMask=0077 if the user does not have its private user group.

### Bug Description

Lubuntu 19.04 and newer uses Calamares as installer. During the installation, the user can choose to encrypt the entire disk (Full Disk Encryption FDE). Calamares creates an LUKS container (and an EFI-System-Partition, when needed).

When booting, Grub asks for the passphrase to unlock the LUKS container. For convenience, there is the keyfile "/crypto\_keyfile.bin" (600, root:root) which will be used later to unlock the LUKS container again.

An unprivileged user can't copy or read the keyfile. But the keyfile is also in the initrd.img.

Attack:

Even an unprivileged user has read-access to the initrd.img under /boot, so the attacker can execute:

(1) $ unmkinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-5.0.0.20-generic /tmp/initrd

(2) $ cp /tmp/initrd/main/crypto\_keyfile.bin ~

DREAD (LOW = 1, MEDIUM = 2, HIGH = 3):

Damage: HIGH => This attack allows to get the keyfile

Reproducibility: HIGH => Works every time with access to the system

Exploitability: LOW/MEDIUM => You must have access to a shell and the unencrypted device (maybe in combination with another vulnerability)

Affected users: MEDIUM => Every user which uses Lubuntu 19.04 and newer in combination with FDE, maybe also other users

Discoverability: HIGH => The origin of this bug report is publicly logged: <https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2019/07/02/%23lubuntu.html#t10:26>

DREAD-Rating: 12/13 of 15

[Calamares 3.3.4](/calamares/calamares/releases/tag/v3.3.4)

Another quick follow-up release, with fixes for users of Boost::Python modules (as opposed to the default pybind11). There are new features in *shellprocess* and *contextualprocess*. Process jobmodules now follow the same rules as *shellprocess* for commands. Some crashes and Qt6 weirdness have been fixed.

# Calamares Initramfs Weakness

**Jul 6, 2019**

Systems installed by Calamares up to and including Calamares 3.2.10
may leak cryptographic keys via lax file permissions on initramfs files.
This may allow unprivileged users to obtain the decryption keys for encrypted
disks.

In addition, during installation by Calamares up to and including Calamares 3.2.10
there is a window of opportunity for reading cryptographic keys via lax file permissions.
This may allow unprivileged users to obtain the decryption keys for encrypted disks.

It has been almost exactly two years since the [last CVE for Calamares](/calamares-cve).
This time, there are two ways to leak the cryptographic keys used to encrypt disks using LUKS.

## umask

Under POSIX, a file’s permissions are given by three groups of
file permission bits; the groups give permissions for the owner, group and other
users of the systems. A file which gives read-permission to others is, of course,
readable by everyone on the system.

Under POSIX, a process has a so-called *umask*, which are bits that are **switched off**
when creating a file. In particular, a umask value of 077 (that is octal, so it is
three zero bits, followed by six one bits) switches off group and other permissions,
so creating a file with that umask set will yield a file that is not readable by
others. A umask of 077 is “safe”.

For more explanation of file permissions bits,
please see the [Debian wiki on permissions](https://wiki.debian.org/Permissions).

## Key File Permissions

(
[CVE-2019-13178](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13178)
[#1190](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1190)
)

A key file for LUKS encryption is generated by Calamares. This key file is
sensitive information, because it is used to encrypt the hard disk where
the installation takes place, and an attacker with access to the key file can
use that to defeat disk encryption.

The generation of the key file in Calamares versions up to 3.2.10 is as follows:

* generate the key file,
* `chmod` the key file to 0600 (readable by user/owner only).

When the file is generated, there is a window of opportunity between
generation and `chmod` to read the file, **if** the file is generated
with lax permissions.

To exploit this, an attacker must be logged in to the machine
that is being installed, during installation, and the file must
be generated with lax permissions. Most Live CDs seem to use
an unsafe umask of 022, allowing the file to be created with
permissions 0644. In the brief instant that the file exists
but has not had the permissions changed to 0600, it could be
read by an attacker.

Calamares now explicitly sets the umask to a safe value
before creating the key file. (An additional mitigation,
creating the file with explicit permissions 0600 instead
of relying on umask, will be added in a later Calamares release).

Distributions are encouraged, in addition, to set a safe umask for
the root user, or to set a safe umask during installation.

## Initramfs Information Leak

(
[CVE-2019-13179](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13179)
[#1191](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1191)
)

Most Linux systems boot using an *initial ramfs*, containing tools, drivers, and
data used during system boot. For an encrypted hard disk, that data includes
the key file that is used to encrypt the hard disk. The initial ramfs is
generally stored on an encrypted boot partition, but it is a regular file
once the system has booted. If an attacker can read the initial ramfs file,
the attacker can extract the key file from the initial ramfs – it is not
otherwise encrypted on-disk.

After installation, any user on the installed system may be able
to read the initial ramfs (if it installed with vulnerable permissions),
and extract the key information. Unless something changes the permissions
on the initial ramfs file, this vulnerability persists across reboots
and any user with access to the `/boot` directory (where initial ramfs files live)
can obtain the key.

The generation of the initial ramfs is done through tools external
to Calamares. Depending on the distribution,

* *update-initramfs* (generally, Debian derivatives)
* *mkinitcpio* (generally, Arch derivatives)
* *dracut* (generally, Fedora derivatives)
  one of these three tools is used.

Users of *dracut* are
not vulnerable, as it has had code in place for CVE-2012-4453
for many years. It sets umask 077 before generating the initial ramfs,
and the resulting file is not readable for others.

Users of *mkinitcpio* may be vulnerable, since it uses the umask
when generating new files. Most Live CDs that use *mkinitcpio* seem
to have an unsafe umask of 022 set, so that the resulting file
is readable by others. Calamares now sets a safe umask before
generating the file, **and** actively changes the permissions on
initial ramfs files to a safe value during installation.

Users of *update-initramfs* may be vulnerable, since it requires
explicit configuration to set a umask. If there is no explicit
configuration, the tool uses an unsafe umask value of 022
**regardless** of the environment’s umask setting. Most installed
systems seem to have no explicit setting, and the initial ramfs file
is readable by others. Calamares now **intrusively** adds
a configuration snippet that sets a safe umask before creating
the initial ramfs.

## Mitigations

For installated systems with a potentially vulnerable initial ramfs:

* set a safe umask for the root user,
* change the permissions of initial ramfs files in `/boot` to a
  safe value,
* (for users of *update-initramfs*) add a configuration snippet
  to set the umask to a safe value when creating initial ramfs files.

## Distributions

A new Calamares version, 3.2.11, has been released.
It contains code to address both weaknesses:
the key file is generated safely.
Initial ramfs files are generated with a safe umask
and with an additional safe configuration snippet.

The default configuration for Calamares in version 3.2.11 is
to use safe settings. It is possible for distributions to
disable the safe-settings with an explicit choice in the
configuration files – this may be sensible if the distribution
has **other** mitigations (in particular for *update-initramfs*)
in place.

Existing ISO images, of course, contain vulnerable installation code
and will continue to do so until new ISO images are released.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-50ee491d76
2019-08-13 01:01:16.243261
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : calamares
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 3.2.11
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <https://calamares.io/>
Summary : Installer from a live CD/DVD/USB to disk
Description :
Calamares is a distribution-independent installer framework, designed to install
from a live CD/DVD/USB environment to a hard disk. It includes a graphical
installation program based on Qt 5. This package includes the Calamares
framework and the required configuration files to produce a working replacement
for Anaconda's liveinst.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

An update of Calamares to release 3.2.11, which fixes CVE-2019-13178, a race
condition when LUKS full disk encryption is enabled, between the time when the
LUKS encryption keyfile is created and when secure permissions are set. (The
Calamares 3.2.11 release also fixes the related CVE-2019-13179, but that
security issue does not affect Fedora.) In addition, since the previously
packaged version was Calamares 3.2.8, this update includes all changes from
Calamares 3.2.9: \* \*branding\* now supports `os-release` variables in the
\*strings\* section, which allows re-using (at runtime) information set in
`/etc/os-release`. This requires KDE Frameworks 5.58. upstream issue #1150 (This
feature is now used in the version of `default` branding packaged here. However,
the packages still default to the `auto` branding, which recovers more
information from `/etc/os-release` at RPM installation time.) \* \*branding\*
allows the use of FreeDesktop.org icon names for the \*productLogo\* and
\*productIcon\* keys. If a file is named there, then the file is used, and
otherwise the icon is looked up in the current theme. upstream issue #1160 \*
\*welcome\* allows a custom image path or icon name to be set for the language-
selection drop-down (instead of the international standard one). \* bug fixes.
and from Calamares 3.2.10: \* A crash when no \*finished\* page (or rather, no
page at all) is configured after the last \*exec\* section of the sequence has
been solved. The \*finished\* page can be left out (but then you don���t get the
restart-now functionality). upstream issue #1168 \* The \*slideshow\* which is run
during installation now has API versions. API version 1 (the default) runs as
before, where the slideshow is loaded when the installation starts. API version
2 loads the slideshow on Calamares startup, thus improving responsiveness.
Documentation in `src/branding/README.md`. upstream issue #1152 \* The example
slideshow now uses API version 2. (The packaged one currently still uses API
version 1 though.) \* \*partition\* Now has its own setting for \*requiredStorage\*,
duplicating the same setting in the \*welcome\* module. This is useful for
configurations where no \*welcome\* module is used, but a minimum size must be
checked anyway. upstream issue #1169

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-e61a85c2bb
2019-08-13 01:58:20.879496
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : calamares
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 3.2.11
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <https://calamares.io/>
Summary : Installer from a live CD/DVD/USB to disk
Description :
Calamares is a distribution-independent installer framework, designed to install
from a live CD/DVD/USB environment to a hard disk. It includes a graphical
installation program based on Qt 5. This package includes the Calamares
framework and the required configuration files to produce a working replacement
for Anaconda's liveinst.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

An update of Calamares to release 3.2.11, which fixes CVE-2019-13178, a race
condition when LUKS full disk encryption is enabled, between the time when the
LUKS encryption keyfile is created and when secure permissions are set. (The
Calamares 3.2.11 release also fixes the related CVE-2019-13179, but that
security issue does not affect Fedora.) In addition, since the previously
packaged version was Calamares 3.2.8, this update includes all changes from
Calamares 3.2.9: \* \*branding\* now supports `os-release` variables in the
\*strings\* section, which allows re-using (at runtime) information set in
`/etc/os-release`. This requires KDE Frameworks 5.58. upstream issue #1150 (This
feature is now used in the version of `default` branding packaged here. However,
the packages still default to the `auto` branding, which recovers more
information from `/etc/os-release` at RPM installation time.) \* \*branding\*
allows the use of FreeDesktop.org icon names for the \*productLogo\* and
\*productIcon\* keys. If a file is named there, then the file is used, and
otherwise the icon is looked up in the current theme. upstream issue #1160 \*
\*welcome\* allows a custom image path or icon name to be set for the language-
selection drop-down (instead of the international standard one). \* bug fixes.
and from Calamares 3.2.10: \* A crash when no \*finished\* page (or rather, no
page at all) is configured after the last \*exec\* section of the sequence has
been solved. The \*finished\* page can be left out (but then you don���t get the
restart-now functionality). upstream issue #1168 \* The \*slideshow\* which is run
during installation now has API versions. API version 1 (the default) runs as
before, where the slideshow is loaded when the installation starts. API version
2 loads the slideshow on Calamares startup, thus improving responsiveness.
Documentation in `src/branding/README.md`. upstream issue #1152 \* The example
slideshow now uses API version 2. (The packaged one currently still uses API
version 1 though.) \* \*partition\* Now has its own setting for \*requiredStorage\*,
duplicating the same setting in the \*welcome\* module. This is useful for
configurations where no \*welcome\* module is used, but a minimum size must be
checked anyway. upstream issue #1169
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for calamares
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2019:2654-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1140256 #1152377
Cross-References: CVE-2019-13178
Affected Products:
openSUSE Backports SLE-15
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for calamares fixes the following issues:
- Launch with "pkexec calamares" in openSUSE Tumbleweed, but launch with
"xdg-su -c calamares" in openSUSE Leap 15.
Update to Calamares 3.2.15:
- "displaymanager" module now treats "sysconfig" as a regular entry in the
"displaymanagers" list, and the "sysconfigSetup" key is used as a
shorthand to force only that entry in the list.
- "machineid" module has been re-written in C++ and extended with a new
configuration key to generate urandom pool data.
- "unpackfs" now supports a special "sourcefs" value of file for copying
single files (optionally with renaming) or directory trees to the target
system.
- "unpackfs" now support an "exclude" and "excludeFile" setting for
excluding particular files or patters from unpacking.
Update to Calamares 3.2.14:
- "locale" module no longer recognizes the legacy GeoIP configuration.
This has been deprecated since Calamares 3.2.8 and is now removed.
- "packagechooser" module can now be custom-labeled in the overall
progress (left-hand column).
- "displaymanager" module now recognizes KDE Plasma 5.17.
- "displaymanager" module now can handle Wayland sessions and can detect
sessions from their .desktop files.
- "unpackfs" now has special handling for sourcefs setting “file”.
Update to Calamares 3.2.13.
More about upstream changes:
<https://calamares.io/calamares-3.2.13-is-out/> and

CVE-2019-13178)

<https://calamares.io/> and <https://github.com/calamares/calamares/releases>
This update was imported from the openSUSE:Leap:15.0:Update update project.

# Calamares 3.2.12 released

**Aug 7, 2019**

The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the
availability of **Calamares 3.2.12**, a feature release in the
Calamares 3.2.x series. A new module, *packagechooser*, has been
added to complement the *netinstall* module. Esperanto is now
available as a translation.
This is a short-cycle release.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):

* apt-ghetto
* Bill Auger
* embar

## Core

* Preliminary work to allow jobs to have a *weight* assigned to them
  has been added. This will allow the progress bar to better reflect
  progress by the amount of work done rather than purely by the
  number of jobs. (Thanks to Bill Auger)
* Preliminary work has been added to post the installation log to a
  pastebin for bug reporting. (Thanks to Bill Auger)
* Support for translated human-readable strings in Calamares
  config files has been added. This is used only in the *packagechooser*
  module (see below) but will expand to those modules that need
  user-visible strings from the configuration file (existing
  solutions need either gettext or Qt support).
* Esperanto is now available when Qt version 5.12.2 or later is used.

## Modules

* *fstab* A new configuration key *efiMountOptions* has been added, to
  allow setting filesystem options specifically for the EFI partition.
  (Thanks to apt-ghetto)
* *packagechooser* is a new module for low-density package choices,
  e.g. for selecting a default desktop environment, or adding some
  proprietary drivers, or chosing browsers of office suites. It presents
  **one** collection of items – at most ten or so, because of the UI –
  and the user can select zero or more of them. The behavior is
  configurable, and package information can be set through the Calamares
  configuration file or by reading AppData files for the packages.
  See the [deployment wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/Deploy-Configuration) for more details. #426

Link creation failed, target: /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York; link name: /etc/localtime  This is likely due to missing Python support. As suggest in the bug report in Calamares github issue.

# Full disk encryption with LUKS (including /boot)

23 May 2014
> Update (25/01/15): I wrote a [new post](/2015/01/25/linux-mint-encryption/) about how to achieve the same thing with Linux Mint.

While looking for information about how to encrypt my laptop’s hard drive, among the repeated claims that the partition on which `/boot` resides must remain unencrypted, I found the suggestion that GRUB should be able to handle cryptography since it can be set up with a hashed password.

Being too lazy to want to deal with a separate boot partition, I went looking to see what modules GRUB can load, and there they were[1](#fn:1): `crypto.mod`, `cryptodisk.mod` and even `luks.mod`!

Since there don’t appear to be any instructions on how to fully encrypt a system including `/boot`, I’ve decided to make a short guide on how to do it.

> This guide will describe setting up an encrypted Arch Linux system. The procedure is mostly distribution-agnostic, but note that anything involving `mkinitcpio` is Arch Linux specific and must be replaced if another distribution is used.

## Set up partitions (LVM on LUKS)

This is well-documented elsewhere, so I won’t be explaining it. If something is unfamiliar to you, I recommend reading the [ArchWiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS) on the subject before proceeding.

```
parted -s /dev/sda mklabel msdos
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 2048s 100%
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda1
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 lvm
pvcreate /dev/mapper/lvm
vgcreate vg /dev/mapper/lvm
lvcreate -L 4G vg -n swap
lvcreate -L 15G vg -n root
lvcreate -l +100%FREE vg -n home
mkswap -L swap /dev/mapper/vg-swap
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg-root
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg-home
mount /dev/mapper/vg-root /mnt
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/mapper/vg-home /mnt/home

```
## Install Linux

At this point you should be in a live system with all partitions mounted, so you can go ahead and run the install. Just be sure not to reboot once it’s done.

> Don’t forget to add the `lvm2` and `encrypt` hooks to `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` and run
>
> ```
> mkinitcpio -p linux
>
> ```

## Configure GRUB

With `/boot` on an encrypted device, `grub-mkconfig` should have GRUB load the necessary modules to decrypt and mount it[2](#fn:2).

`grub-install`, on the other hand, will refuse to work, complain about /boot being encrypted, and demand that `GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=1` be added to the config. This is a [bug](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?41524) (in the error message). Instead, add

```
GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y

```

to `/etc/default/grub`.
Now, before trying to find and load the initial ramdisk, GRUB will ask for a passphrase to decrypt `/dev/sda1`.

Finally, add the `cryptdevice` kernel parameter[3](#fn:3)

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptdevice=/dev/sda1:lvm"

```

and run

```
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
grub-install /dev/sda

```

Reboot, and that’s it. You now have a fully encrypted system.

## Bonus: Login once

You’ve probably noticed that there remains the minor annoyance of having to decrypt your drive twice: once for GRUB and once for the kernel. Evidently, when GRUB passes control to the kernel, the encrypted drive is dismounted.

There is, however, a way to open a LUKS device without entering a passphrase: with a keyfile. The `encrypt` hook can take the file specified in the `cryptkey` kernel parameter (default: `/crypto_keyfile.bin`) and use it to unlock the `cryptdevice`.

```
dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=/crypto_keyfile.bin
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda1 /crypto_keyfile.bin

```

I tried various methods to get GRUB to load the keyfile into memory and pass it to the kernel, without success. Then, I realised that the `initrd` image is itself something GRUB loads into memory, and `mkinitcpio.conf` has a very convenient `FILES` option…

```
FILES=/crypto_keyfile.bin

```

Run `mkinitcpio` again, and when you reboot, you’ll only need to enter your password once.

### Security considerations

While the computer is off, the keyfile is stored inside the encrypted drive, so it is secure. When the computer is on, however, the keyfile is unencrypted, with a copy on the ramdisk. So, you should probably make sure only *root* can access these files:

```
chmod 000 /crypto_keyfile.bin  # actually, even root doesn't need to access this
chmod -R g-rwx,o-rwx /boot     # just to be safe

```

The keyfile will probably also be retained in memory, but so is the LUKS master key. If the attacker has enough access to your system for that to be a problem, encryption is moot. So long as there are no copies of the keyfile anywhere else, you should be fine. In other words, don’t back it up or reuse it elsewhere.

# Calamares

Calamares aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and distribution-agnostic

 [Intro](/#one)
 [Latest News](/#news)

## placeholder image 1What is Calamares

Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable, in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases. Calamares aims to be easy, usable & beautiful while remaining independent of any particular Linux distribution.

[Read More](/about#what-is-calamares)

## placeholder image 2Knowledge Base

The Guide linked above has documentation for end-users, the wiki is mostly for distro developers. The developer’s guide contains information on building Calamares, on its design, and localization.

[Wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki)

## Calamares look

Since Calamares is designed to be customized, themed and branded by individual distributions, it can look very different when used by specific distributions. A separate extensions package contains examples and custom modules.

# Unsafe generation of initramfs during FDE #1191

## Description

![@tsimonq2](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3689821?u=bd46833d40b2b5a987a4360911469ac2f37b6f1f&v=4&size=48)[tsimonq2](https://github.com/tsimonq2)opened [on Jul 2, 2019](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1191#issue-463394854)

[Downstream bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/calamares/%2Bbug/1835095), [IRC logs from the user who reported it](https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2019/07/02/%23lubuntu.html#t10:26).

The tl;dr is:

"The initramfs images that are generated by mkinitramfs will have the user:group set to root:root, but their access flags will be 644 (-rw-r--r--). This means that any user or even a script that has read access to the file system can read and extract the secret keyfile from an initramfs image."

initramfs needs to be ran with a different umask here.

## Description

Hello, please note that there's a race condition between the time when the key file is created and when the permissions are changed that it is probably visible to some or all users on the system.

[calamares/src/modules/luksbootkeyfile/main.py](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/blob/71a719d7311b406aabe94968b1dcf769fef92965/src/modules/luksbootkeyfile/main.py#L99)

The safe way to create a file with restricted permissions is to set the process umask(2) before creating the file. The shell built-in umask(1) command can do this.

Thanks

### Bug Description

Hello!

I've had a short discussion about this issue on lubuntu irc, and I was asked to open a bug report. Basically I only tested this on lubuntu 19.04 x64 live image on a UEFI system, I haven't tested other ubuntu flavors.

Anyway, I was poking around with disk encryption, and I noticed that lubuntu live image uses a graphical installation tool called Calamares. This tool has an option to encrypt the hard disk during installation, and the encryption setup that is used is the newer one with /boot folder as part of the encrypted rootfs. Traditionally the installers used to setup encryption where there is a main LUKS-encrypted rootfs volume on the HDD and a separate unencrypted /boot partition where the grub config files, the kernel and the initrd images reside. Ever since grub2 added support for LUKS several distros have apparently moved to the newer scheme which is very similar to the one that was first described by Pavel Kogan in his blog.

A) <https://www.pavelkogan.com/2014/05/23/luks-full-disk-encryption/>

B) <https://www.pavelkogan.com/2015/01/25/linux-mint-encryption/>

This new scheme stores the rootfs (including the /boot folder) on a single LUKS-encrypted partition with two keyslots in use. One of the keyslots is normally a passphrase that is used in the first stage by the grub2 EFI image as pre-boot authentication. It serves to decrypt the rootfs, access the contents of /boot and copy the config, kernel and initrd image to RAM. Once done, grub2 then forgets the passphrase and closes the encrypted volume. The system will continue to boot, but at this point the rootfs will now have to be decrypted a second time - this time by the kernel/initrd so it can be mounted. Normally this is the point where the user would be asked to enter a passphrase for the second time, but for convenience reasons (to automate the process) a second LUKS keyslot and a keyfile are used instead.

The file /crypto\_keyfile.bin is generated during the installation phase. This is the secret keyfile that is used to unlock the other LUKS keyslot and decrypt the rootfs. It is properly protected with owner set to root:root and file permissions 600 (-rw-------). Unfortunately the key is not of much use while it resides inside the encrypted volume that it is supposed to decrypt. This is where initramfs-tools comes into play. I believe there is a special hook inside /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks that is responsible for copying this crypto\_keyfile.bin file into appropriate initrd image. This image that now contains the secret keyfile is copied into RAM during the first decryption stage by the grub2.

While the original secret keyfile /crypto\_keyfile.bin is protected:

$ ls -l /

...

-rw------- 1 root root 2048 jul 2 18:34 crypto\_keyfile.bin

...

$ sha1sum /crypto\_keyfile.bin

sha1sum: /crypto\_keyfille.bin: Permission denied

$ sudo sha1sum /crypto\_keyfile.bin

7a1c44fd036510cc02e32c094bd16b4a76a7f14c /crypto\_keyfile.bin

The second copy (the one inside initramfs image) is not:

$ ls -l /boot

...

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 68149041 jul 2 18:35 initrd.img-5.0.0-13-generic

As you can see, the initramfs images that are generated by mkinitramfs will have the user:group set to root:root, but their access flags will be 644 (-rw-r--r--). This means that any user or even a script that has read access to the file system can read and extract the secret keyfile from an initramfs image.

Run as user:

$ unmkinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-5.0.0-13-generic /tmp

$ sha1sum /tmp/main/crypto\_keyfile.bin

7a1c44fd036510cc02e32c094bd16b4a76a7f14c /tmp/main/crypto\_keyfile.bin

Would there be any adverse effects, if we were to set mkinitramfs (i.e. via a hook) to always set file permissions of initramfs images to 600 whenever this type of disk encryption is used?

# Calamares 3.2.13 released

**Aug 30, 2019**

The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the
availability of **Calamares 3.2.13**, a features-and-bugfix release in the
Calamares 3.2.x series. There are improvements in the *packagechooser*
module, an optional *Donate* button on the welcome page, and better QML support.
This is a short-cycle release.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):

* Arnaud Ferraris
* Arnaud Rebillout
* Bill Auger
* Kevin Kofler

## Core

* The Calamares standard coding style – embodied in `ci/calamaresstyle`
  has had a few updates and has now been consistently applied across
  the core codebase (e.g. libcalamares, libcalamaresui, calamares, but
  not the modules).
* *KCoreAddons* is now a required dependency. This lets us drop a chunk
  of code that was copied from KCoreAddons years ago, and use the
  (maintained!) upstream version instead. It also gives us KMacroExpander
  everywhere, which will simplify code for handling substitutions
  in configuration files.
* *Slideshows* now have a new property *activatedInCalamares* which
  controls the keyboard shortcuts (and can control timers and other
  properties of the slideshow, too).

## Modules

* The *packagechooser* module can load data from the config-file,
  from AppData XML files referred by the config-file, and (new) also
  from AppStream caches by referring to an application’s AppStream id. #1212
* The *partition* module now understands the units *KB*, *MB*, *GB* which
  are powers-of-ten sizes, alongside the powers-of-two sizes that it already
  used. (thanks to Arnaud)
* The *welcome* module now supports a *Donate* button if *showDonateUrl*
  is set to a non-empty URL. #1197
* The *welcome* module can have URLs for the various buttons configured
  directly in the module configuration (rather than in `branding.desc`).

# Calamares 3.2.11 released

**Jul 7, 2019**

The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is .. not particularly happy to have to announce the
availability of **Calamares 3.2.11**, a security update in
the features-and-functionality series of Calamares 3.2.x.
This is purely a security release for CVE-2019-13179 and CVE-2019-13178.
A full description is avalable at [Calamares Initramfs Weakness](/calamares-cve-2019).

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):

* No other contributors this time around.

This is a security release with no functional changes (except for
improved security) relative to 3.2.10. The Calamares team would like
to acknowledge the help of the following people in reporting and
understanding the issues (alphabetically by first name):

* Kevin Kofler
* Seth Arnold
* Simon Quigley
* Thomas Ward

Both CVE’s have been resolved.
