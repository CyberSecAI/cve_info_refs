Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-13347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a misleading user interface (UI) within the SAML Single Sign-On plugin. Specifically, when the "Reactivate inactive users" option is disabled, but the "User Update Method" is set to "Update from SAML Attributes", locally disabled users are incorrectly re-enabled during login. The UI implies that disabling "Reactivate inactive users" would prevent this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Misleading UI:** The UI element controlling user reactivation does not behave as expected, causing a discrepancy between the intended and actual functionality.
*   **Incorrect User Management:** The plugin inappropriately re-enables deactivated users when the "Reactivate inactive users" option is disabled, but user updates via SAML attributes are enabled, violating the user's disabled state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The primary impact is the unintended re-enabling of deactivated users. This allows those users access to the application, potentially granting access to sensitive data or systems when they should not have it.
*   **Compromised Access Control:** It weakens the principle of least privilege by overriding the intentional disabling of user accounts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of access control mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SAML Login Process:** Exploitation occurs during the standard SAML login process when the vulnerable settings are in place.
*   **Configuration Specific:** The vulnerability only manifests when specific configurations are in use. This includes having "User Update Method" set to "Update from SAML Attributes" and the "Reactivate inactive users" option disabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User on Identity Provider (IdP):** The attacker needs to be a user that has been deactivated within the Atlassian application, but still holds a valid account within the identity provider
*   **Configuration Knowledge:** The attacker does not need specific technical expertise but knowledge of the application and that the specific configuration of this plugin.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects SAML Single Sign-On plugins for Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Bamboo.
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   2.4.0-3.0.3 for Bitbucket and Bamboo
    *   3.1.0-3.2.2 for Jira and Confluence
*   **Fixed Versions:**
    *   3.3.0 for Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket.
    *   2.5.4 for Bamboo
*   The content clarifies that the vulnerability only occurs if the "User Update Method" is set to "Update from SAML Attributes" and the "Reactivate inactive users" option is disabled. The default setting is that "Reactivate inactive users" is always activated, so users are only affected if they changed the default settings.
*   The advisory notes the impact is relatively low since users have to be authorized by the identity provider first
*   The bug was reported by Lukas Braune of Siemens.
