**Important Update Effective February 1, 2024!**

Due to recent changes in Jira and Confluence, we've made the tough decision to discontinue the OpenID Connect (OIDC)/OAuth app and no longer provide new versions for the newest Jira/Confluence releases as of January 31, 2024.

This is due to some necessary components no longer shipping with Jira/Confluence, which would require some extensive rewrites of the OIDC App.

**Important Update! This app will be discontinued soon!**

Due to recent changes in Jira, which no longer ships with some components required for our Read Receipts app to run, we've made the tough decision to discontinue the app, as of Februar 5, 2025.

**Important Update! This app will be discontinued soon!**

We've made the tough business decision to discontinue the app, as of January 11, 2025.

### Summary

This advisory discloses a **medium severity** security vulnerability affecting SAML Single Sign On Plugin Version 2.4.0-2.5.3 for Bitbucket and Bamboo, and 3.1.0 - 3.2.2 Jira and Confluence.

Please **upgrade your** Installations to fix this vulnerability.

### Am I affected?

You are **only** affected, if:

* the **User Update Method** is set to **Update from SAML Attributes**
  **and**
* you deactivated the **Reactivate inactive users** option.

In the default settings, ****Reactivate inactive users**** is always activated. Thus you are only affected if you change the default settings.

### Details

The SAML SSO plugin has an option to **Reactivate inactive users**. When enabled, locally disabled users are reactivated during login, even if the feature to update users with data provided by the IdP is disabled.

When **Reactivate inactive users** is disabled, but the user update with data from the IdP is enabled, locally disabled users are reenabled. The UI is misleading here, the expected behaviour should be to keep locally disabled users disabled when **Reactivate inactive users** is not active.

Since a user must first be authorized by the identity provider, this vulnerability has a rather **low impact**.

### What You Need to Do

If you need the ability to keep locally disabled users disabled while having user update enabled, upgrade to SAML Single Sign On (SSO) Version 3.3.0 (2.5.4 for Bamboo).

If you need help with either if these courses of action, please raise a support request via our [Support Portal](https://jira.resolution.de/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).

### Support

If you have questions or concerns regarding this advisory, please raise a support request via our [Support Portal](https://jira.resolution.de/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).

### Acknowledgment

Thanks to Lukas Braune of Siemens for reporting the bug.
