Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13589:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `paranoid2` gem version 1.1.6 was compromised by a third party who inserted malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Malicious Code Injection:** The gem contains a backdoor that executes arbitrary code. The code fetches and executes code from a remote pastebin, allowing the attacker to run any code on the server where the gem is used.
- **Code Execution:** The injected code uses `eval` to execute code from a remote source.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on systems where the compromised version of the `paranoid2` gem is installed.
- **Total Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data, modify files, or completely disrupt the system.
- **Complete system compromise:** This could lead to a full compromise of the affected systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Supply chain attack:** The vulnerability was introduced by compromising a legitimate gem package.
- **Network-based attack:** The backdoor code fetches the malicious payload from a remote server (pastebin), meaning an active network connection is required for the exploit.
- **Exploitation occurs when the Rails environment starts in production mode**.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Compromised gem maintainer/uploader:** The attacker needs the ability to publish a malicious version of the gem.
- **Internet access for the compromised server:** The compromised server needs to be able to access the internet to download and execute the malicious payload.
- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need special access to the system beyond having the vulnerable gem installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The malicious code is executed within a new thread.
- The code only executes in a Rails production environment ("p").
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-506 (Malicious Code).
- Snyk assigns a critical severity score of 9.8 (CVSS v3.1).
