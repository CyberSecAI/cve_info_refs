Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-13021, CVE-2019-13022, and CVE-2019-13023, as they pertain to the JETSELECT application:

**CVE-2019-13021**

*   **Root Cause:** During installation, the JETSELECT application's installation script (`3passchange.sh`) writes a copy of the master password to a `.bak` file (`sfc-general.properties.bak`) stored in a world readable directory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure storage of sensitive data:** The master password is saved to a file with inadequate access controls.
    *   **Plaintext Exposure:** Although the password is not stored directly in plain text, the encryption method is weak and trivial to reverse.
    *   **World readable permissions** The `sfc-general.properties.bak` file is world readable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A low-privileged user can view the file, which reveals the encrypted master password.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local file system access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Low-privileged user access to the server's file system.

**CVE-2019-13022**

*   **Root Cause:** The JETSELECT application uses a weak encryption algorithm (XOR with a single byte key, followed by Base64 encoding) to protect passwords.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Weak encryption:** The XOR encryption is easily reversible.
    *   **Lack of proper salting** No salting is applied to the password.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who obtains the encrypted password can easily decrypt it and gain administrative access to the application and also MySQL database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Access to the `ENCtool.jar` file through the server's filesystem (leveraging the LFI vulnerability in the underlying Glassfish application), and the password hashes from `sfc-general.properties`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Low-privileged user with access to server filesystem and a copy of the `ENCtool.jar` file, or access to the .bak file containing the password.

**CVE-2019-13023**

*   **Root Cause:** Sensitive data, such as RADIUS secrets and SNMP strings, is stored in cleartext within the HTML of the web application's interface.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cleartext storage of sensitive data:** The application does not protect sensitive information from being viewed directly in the HTML source.
    *   **Insufficient access control:** Even low-privileged users can view this sensitive information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A low privileged user, such as the ETO role, can view sensitive data within the web application interface.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Viewing the HTML source of the web application.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Access to the web application interface, even with low privileges.

In summary, the document describes how a combination of insecure file storage, weak encryption, and cleartext data exposure allowed for the complete compromise of the JETSELECT application. These vulnerabilities highlight the importance of secure coding practices, proper access control, and comprehensive security testing methodologies.
