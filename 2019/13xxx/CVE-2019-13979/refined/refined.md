The provided content is related to CVE-2019-13979.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper restrictions and validations on file uploads, specifically when uploading user avatars. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including web shells, to a publicly accessible directory with execute permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application does not validate the type of file being uploaded, allowing an attacker to upload any file type.
- Lack of server-side validation: File type validation is absent on the server side.
- Upload directory with execute permissions: The directory where uploaded files are stored has execute permissions, allowing the execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete server takeover: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by uploading and executing a web shell.
- Account compromise: The attacker can take control of user accounts and workstations, including those of administrators.
- Data breach: With control over the server, attackers can access sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- File upload functionality: Specifically the avatar upload feature, is used as the attack vector.
- Web shell upload: The attacker uploads a specially crafted malicious file (web shell) that is then executed on the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the application's file upload functionality, such as the avatar upload feature, is required.
- Ability to create and upload a malicious web shell.
- Basic understanding of how to exploit a web shell to gain remote command execution.
