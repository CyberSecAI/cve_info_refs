Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13391:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer over-read within the `ComplexImages` function in `MagickCore/fourier.c` due to incorrect calls to `GetCacheViewVirtualPixels`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The `ComplexImages` function reads beyond the allocated memory buffer.
*   Incorrect use of `GetCacheViewVirtualPixels` function which is used to access pixel data, leads to reading invalid memory location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most likely impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service, where the application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to accessing invalid memory.
*   **Information Disclosure:** It is possible in some cases that an attacker could read data from memory beyond the allocated buffer, which might lead to sensitive data exposure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker could exploit this remotely by supplying a specially crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path. Although SUSE rates the attack vector as local, the NVD rates it as network which is consistent with publicly available information and the github issue linked.
*   **File Processing:** The vulnerability occurs when ImageMagick processes a crafted image, so any application using the ImageMagick library to handle untrusted image files are potentially exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to ImageMagick. This could be achieved through various means such as web uploads or file processing by a vulnerable service.
*   No user privileges required, just the ability to get the image processed by ImageMagick.
*   User interaction is required for a network attack since it requires the user to process the malicious image file. However, no interaction is needed for a local attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is present in ImageMagick version 7.0.8-50 Q16 and potentially earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in later versions of ImageMagick with a patch.
*   The vulnerability can trigger a crash which can be observed via Address Sanitizer tools.
*   The vulnerability was reported via github issue #1588.
