# Exploiting Wi-Fi Stack on Tesla Model S

by Tencent Keen Security Lab

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/head.png)

In the past two years, Keen Security Lab did in-depth research on the security of Tesla Cars and presented our research results on Black Hat 2017 and Black Hat 2018. Our research involves many in-vehicle components. We demonstrated how to hack into these components, including CID, IC, GATEWAY, and APE. The vulnerabilities we utilized exists in the kernel, browser, MCU firmware, UDS protocol, and OTA updating services. It is worth noting that recently we did some interesting works on Autopilot module, we analyzed the implementation details of autowipers and lane recognition function and make an example of attacking in the physical world.

To understand the security of Tesla's on-board system more comprehensively, we researched the Wi-Fi module (aka Parrot on Model S) and found two vulnerabilities in the Wi-Fi firmware and Wi-Fi driver. By combining these two vulnerabilities, the host Linux system can be compromised.

## Introduction

This article reveals the details of two vulnerabilities and introduces how to exploit these vulnerabilities, which proves that these vulnerabilities can be used by an attacker to hack into the Tesla Model S in-vehicle system remotely through the Wi-Fi.

## Parrot Module

The third-party module Parrot on Tesla Model S is FC6050W, which integrates the Wireless function and Bluetooth function. Parrot connects to CID via USB protocol and runs Linux. Parrot uses the USB Ethernet gadget so that Parrot can communicate with CID trough Ethernet. When Tesla Model S connected to a wireless network, it is Parrot connected to the wireless network. Then, the network traffic from CID routed by Parrot.

We can find the hardware organization from a very detailed datasheet[1].

The pinout description of Parrot also presented in the datasheet. The Linux shell can be found through the Debug UART pins.

The reset pin connects to the GPIO port of CID. Thus CID can reset the whole Parrot module by using these commands.

## Marvell Wifi Chip

The Marvell 88W8688 is a low-cost, low-power highly-integrated IEEE 802.11a/g/b MAC/Baseband/RF WLAN and Bluetooth Baseband/RF system-on-chip (SoC) [2].

The block diagram published on the Marvell website[3].

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image5.png)

The 88w8688 contains an embedded high-performance Marvell Ferocean ARM9-compatible processor. By modifying the firmware, we acquired the value of the Main ID Register, which is 0x11101556. According to the value, we concluded the CPU might be Feroceon 88FR101 rev 1. On Parrot, the Marvell 88w8688 chipset connects to the host system via the SDIO interface.

The memory region of 88w8688 could be as follows.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/table1.png)

## Firmware

The firmware download process of 88w8688 contains two stages, the helper firmware âsd8688\_helper.binâ downloads to chip first, then the main firmware âsd8688.binâ downloads to chip. The helper responsible for and downloading the firmware file and verifying every chunk of the firmware file. The firmware file consists of many chunks, below is the structure of each chunk stable.

| ``` 1234567 ``` | ``` struct fw_chunk {     int chunk_type;  int addr;  unsigned int length;  unsigned int crc32;  unsigned char [1];} __packed; ``` |
| --- | --- |

The 88w8688 chip runs based on ThreadX OS which is an RTOS targeting for embedded devices. The code of ThreadX can be found in the ROM region, so the firmware âsd8688.binâ runs as an application of ThreadX.

On Tesla, the version ID of firmware âsd8688.binâ is âsd8688-B1, RF868X, FP44, 13.44.1.p49â. All the following research results are based on this version.

After identified the ThreadX API, the information about tasks is as below.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/table2.png)

Also, the information about memory pools is as below.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/table3.png)

## Log and Debug

The firmware did not implement the CPU vector handler for Data Abort, Prefetch Abort, Undefine, and SWI, which means the firmware halts after a crash, and we cannot know where and why the firmware crash.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image6.png)

So, we patched the firmware with our custom Prefetch Abort and Data Abort vector handler. The handler records the values of register includes general-purpose register, the status register, and link register in system mode and IRQ mode. In this way, we can know where the code runs in both system mode and IRQ mode when a crash happens.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image7.png)

We chose to write these values to unused memory, for example, 0x52100~0x5FFFF. These values still can be read after the chip reset.

After implemented the undefine vector handler and changed some instruction to undefine instruction, we can get or set registers when the firmware is running. In this way, we can debug the firmware.

To re-download a new firmware to chip, try to send the command HostCmd\_CMD\_SOFT\_RESET from kernel to chip, then the chip resets and new firmware downloads.

## Vulnerability in Firmware

The 88w8688 chip supports 802.11e WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) protocol. In this protocol, the station could send an action frame Add Traffic Stream (ADDTS) request with Traffic Specification (TSPEC) to another device. Then the other device returns an action frame ADDTS response. Below is the action frame.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image8.png)

The whole process of ADDTS may like this. When the host operation system wants to send an ADDTS request, the kernel driver fills and sends a HostCmd\_DS\_COMMAND structure with command HostCmd\_CMD\_WMM\_ADDTS\_REQ to chip. Then the firmware transmits the ADDTS request packet over the air. When the chip received an ADDTS response from another device, it copies this response without an action header to the HostCmd\_CMD\_WMM\_ADDTS\_REQ structure as a result of ADDTS\_REQ command and passes the structure HostCmd\_DS\_COMMAND to the kernel driver. After that, the kernel driver process this response.

| ``` 12345678910111213 ``` | ``` struct _HostCmd_DS_COMMAND{    u16 Command;    u16 Size;    u16 SeqNum;    u16 Result;    union    {        HostCmd_DS_GET_HW_SPEC hwspec;        HostCmd_CMD_WMM_ADDTS_REQ;        //â¦â¦.     }} ``` |
| --- | --- |

The vulnerability exists in the process of copying the data from the ADDTS response packet to the HostCmd\_CMD\_WMM\_ADDTS\_REQ structure. The length of copy calculated by subtracting 4 bytes length of action header from length of action frame. But if the action frame only contains a header and the length of the header is only 3 bytes, the length needs to copy is 0xffffffff. So, the memory could be corrupted very badly, resulting in a crash very stable.

## Vulnerability in Driver

There are three kinds of data sent between the chip and the kernel driver through the SDIO interface, MV\_TYPE\_DATA, MV\_TYPE\_CMD, and MV\_TYPE\_EVENT. The definition of commands and events can be found in source code.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image9.png)

The whole process about command processing as follows. The driver handles the command from a user-space process such as ck5050, wpa\_supplicant and initializes a structure HostCmd\_DS\_COMMAND by the function wlan\_prepare\_cmd(). The last argument pdata\_buf points to a related structure that contains the necessary information to initialize the structure HostCmd\_DS\_COMMAND. The function wlan\_process\_cmdresp() is responsible for handling the command response from the chip and copying back the results to the structure references by pdata\_buf.

| ``` 123456 ``` | ``` intwlan_prepare_cmd(wlan_private * priv,                 u16 cmd_no,                 u16 cmd_action,                 u16 wait_option, WLAN_OID cmd_oid, void *pdata_buf); ``` |
| --- | --- |

The vulnerability exists in the function wlan\_process\_cmdresp() when the driver is processing the response of command HostCmd\_CMD\_GET\_MEM. The function wlan\_process\_cmdresp() not check if the member size of structure HostCmd\_DS\_COMMAND is valid, which results in a buffer overflow when copying the data from structure HostCmd\_DS\_COMMAND to other place.

## Code Execute in Wi-Fi Chip

Obviously, the vulnerability in firmware is a heap overflow. To utilize this vulnerability to gain code execution in the Wi-Fi chip, we need to figure out how the function memcpy() corrupted the memory, what could happen after triggering the vulnerability, and where the crash happens.

To trigger the vulnerability, the length of action header should be less than 4, and we must provide the correct dialog token in action frame, which means the length passed to memcpy() must be 0xffffffff. The source address is fixed because the source buffer allocates from memory pool pool\_start\_id\_rmlmebuf, which has only one block. The destination buffer allocates from memory pool pool\_start\_id\_tx. So the destination address could be one of the four addresses.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/table4.png)

The source address and destination address locate in RAM region 0xC0000000~0xC003FFFF, but the address range from 0xC0000000 to 0xCFFFFFFF is valid. So, the results of reading or writing to these memory areas are the same.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/table5.png)

Because the memory region from 0xC0000000 to 0xCFFFFFFF is readable and writable, the process of copying is almost impossible to reach the boundary of the memory region. After 0x40000 bytes copied, the memory can be considered as shifted a distance once. In this process, some data could be overwritten and lost.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image10.png)

The CPU in 88w8688 contains only one core, so the chip may not crash during the execution of copying until an interrupt occurs. Since memory already corrupted by the vulnerability, in most cases, the chip crashed in the interrupt handlers.

The interrupt controller provides a simple firmware interface to the interrupt system. When an interrupt occurs, the firmware gets the interrupt event from the register of the interrupt controller and invokes the related interrupt handler.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/table6.png)

There are many interrupt sources, so the chip can crash at many places after triggering the vulnerability.

One possibility is that the interrupt comes from 0x15, then the function 0x26580 be called. There is a link list pointer at 0xC000CC08. The value of this pointer could be overwritten after triggering the vulnerability. However, the manipulation of the link list may not be able to give us the chance to gain code execution.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image11.png)

Another crash happens in the interrupt handler of the Timer Interrupt. The handler does thread switching sometimes, and another task could resume running, which means the process of copying can be suspended temporarily and the chip crash during other tasks running. In this situation, the firmware crashed in function 0x4D75C usually.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image12.png)

The function read a pointer at 0xC000D7DC, which points to structure TX\_SEMAPHORE. After triggering the vulnerability, we can overwrite the pointer to our fake TX\_SEMAPHORE structure.

| ``` 12345678910 ``` | ``` typedef struct TX_SEMAPHORE_STRUCT{    ULONG       tx_semaphore_id;    CHAR_PTR    tx_semaphore_name;    ULONG       tx_semaphore_count;    struct TX_THREAD_STRUCT  *tx_semaphore_suspension_list;    ULONG                    tx_semaphore_suspended_count;    struct TX_SEMAPHORE_STRUCT *tx_semaphore_created_next;      struct TX_SEMAPHORE_STRUCT *tx_semaphore_created_previous;} TX_SEMAPHORE; ``` |
| --- | --- |

If the member tx\_semaphore\_suspension\_list also points to our fake TX\_THREAD\_STRUCT structure, when the function \_tx\_semaphore\_put() update the link of the adjacent threads in TX\_THREAD\_STRUCT structure, we can get a chance to âwrite anything anywhere.â

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image13.png)

We can directly overwrite the next instruction after âBL os\_semaphore\_putâ with a jump instruction to archive code execute as the memory in ITCM is RWX. The difficulty lies in we need to spray both TX\_SEMAPHORE structure and TX\_THREAD\_STRUCT structure in memory. We also need to make sure the pointer tx\_semaphore\_suspension\_list in structure TX\_SEMAPHORE points to our fake TX\_THREAD\_STRUCT structure. These conditions can be satisfied, but the success rate is very low.

We mainly focus on the third crash place, in the handler of MCU interrupts. The pointer g\_interface\_sdio points to structure struct\_interface can be overwritten.

| ``` 123456789101112131415 ``` | ``` struct struct_interface{  int field_0;  struct struct_interface *next;  char *name_ptr;  int sdio_idx;  int fun_enable;  int funE;  int funF;  int funD;  int funA;  int funB; // 0x24  int funG;  int field_2C;}; ``` |
| --- | --- |

The function pointer funB in this structure will be invoked in this function. If the pointer g\_interface\_sdio overwrited, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image14.png)

Here is the register dump when instruction âBX R3â executes in function interface\_call\_funB(). In this dump, g\_interface\_sdio overwrited by 0xabcd1211.

| ``` 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425 ``` | ``` LOG_BP_M0_CPSR      : 0xa000009bLOG_BP_M0_SP        : 0x5fec8LOG_BP_M0_LR        : 0x3cd50LOG_BP_M0_SPSP      : 0xa00000b2LOG_BP_M1_CPSR      : 0xa0000092LOG_BP_M1_SP        : 0x5536cLOG_BP_M1_LR        : 0x4e3d5LOG_BP_M1_SPSP      : 0xa0000013LOG_BP_M2_CPSR      : 0LOG_BP_M2_SP        : 0x58cb8LOG_BP_M2_LR        : 0x40082e8LOG_BP_M2_SPSP      : 0LOG_BP_R1           : 0x1cLOG_BP_R2           : 0LOG_BP_R3           : 0xefdeadbeLOG_BP_R4           : 0x40c0800LOG_BP_R5           : 0LOG_BP_R6           : 0x8000a500LOG_BP_R7           : 0x8000a540LOG_BP_R8           : 0x140LOG_BP_R9           : 0x58cb0LOG_BP_R10          : 0x40082e8LOG_BP_FP           : 0LOG_BP_IP           : 0x8c223fa3LOG_BP_R0           : 0xabcd1211 ``` |
| --- | --- |

The function interface\_call\_funB() called by the handler of MACMCU interrupt at 0x4E3D0.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image15.png)

After the source address of copying reach the address 0xC0040000, the whole memory can be considered as shifted a distance once. After the source address of copying reach the address 0xC0080000, the whole memory shifted twice. The distance could be as follows.

| ``` 1234 ``` | ``` 0xC0016478-0xC000DC9B=0x87DD0xC0016478-0xC000E49B=0x7FDD0xC0016478-0xC000EC9B=0x77DD0xC0016478-0xC000F49B=0x6FDD ``` |
| --- | --- |

After trigger the vulnerability, in most cases, the memory will be shifted 3~5 times when interrupt occurs. The pointer g\_interface\_sdio at address 0xC000B818, so g\_interface\_sdio can be overwritten by the data at these addresses.

| ``` 1234567891011121314151617181920 ``` | ``` 0xC000B818+0x87DD*1=0xC0013FF50xC000B818+0x87DD*2=0xC001C7D20xC000B818+0x87DD*3=0xC0024FAF0xC000B818+0x87DD*4=0xC002D78Câ¦0xC000B818+0x7FDD*1=0xC00137F50xC000B818+0x7FDD*2=0xC001B7D20xC000B818+0x7FDD*3=0xC00237AF0xC000B818+0x7FDD*4=0xC004B700â¦0xC000B818+0x77DD*1=0xC0012FF50xC000B818+0x77DD*2=0xC001A7D20xC000B818+0x77DD*3=0xC0021FAF0xC000B818+0x77DD*4=0xC002978Câ¦0xC000B818+0x6FDD*1=0xC00127F50xC000B818+0x6FDD*2=0xC00197D20xC000B818+0x6FDD*3=0xC00207AF0xC000B818+0x6FDD*4=0xC002778Câ¦ ``` |
| --- | --- |

The addresses 0xC0024FAF, 0xC00237AF and 0xC0021FAF located in a huge DMA buffer 0xC0021F90~0xC0025790 which is used for storing 802.11 Data Frame received by Wi-Fi chip temporarily. So, this huge buffer can be used to spray with fake pointers.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image16.png)

To spray our fake pointers in memory, we can send many normal 802.11 Data Frame full of fake pointers to Wi-Fi chip. The DMA buffer is so huge that we can directly spray our shellcode in it. To improve the success rate of exploiting, we used egg-hunters to search for our shellcode.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image17.png)

If we successfully overwrote g\_interface\_sdio, the shellcode or egg hunter can very close to 0xC000B818. The fake pointer we used is 0x41954 because there is a pointer 0xC000B991 at address 0x41954+0x24. Then, we can hijack $PC to 0xC000B991. At the same time, the pointer 0x41954 can be recognized as normal instructions.

| ``` 12 ``` | ``` 54 19 ADDS            R4, R2, R504 00 MOVS            R4, R0 ``` |
| --- | --- |

We got about a 25% success rate to achieve code execution in this method.

## Attack Host System

The vulnerability in kernel driver can be trigger by sending data from chip through SDIO interface.

The command HostCmd\_CMD\_GET\_MEM initialize by function wlan\_get\_firmware\_mem() in normal case.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image18.png)

In this case, pdata\_buf points to the buffer allocated by the function kmalloc(), which means it is a kernel heap overflow. The function wlan\_get\_firmware\_mem() cannot be called in the real environment, and heap overflow is hard to exploit.

However, a compromised chip can return the result with a different command id after receiving a command. Therefore, the vulnerability can be triggered during the process of many command processing. In this situation, the vulnerability can be heap overflow or stack overflow depending on where pdata\_buf points to. We found the function wlan\_enable\_11d(), which used the address of local variable enable as pdata\_buf. Thus, we can trigger a stack buffer overflow.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image19.png)

The function wlan\_enable\_11d() called by wlan\_11h\_process\_join(). Obviously, HostCmd\_CMD\_802\_11\_SNMP\_MIB used in the process of associating with AP. The vulnerability in firmware only can be trigger when Parrot already connects to an AP. When we get code execution in the chip, Parrot already joined an AP. To trigger the stack buffer overflow in wlan\_enable\_11d(), the compromised chip needs to deceive the kernel driver that the chip disconnects from AP. Then, a reconnection launched by the driver and the command HostCmd\_CMD\_802\_11\_SNMP\_MIB sent to firmware in function wlan\_enable\_11d(). Therefore, to launch the reconnection, the chip only needs to send event EVENT\_DISASSOCIATED to the driver.

After triggering the vulnerability and get code execution in chip, the chip cannot work properly anymore, so our shellcode running in chip need to handle a series of commands when Parrot is trying to reconnect to original AP. The only command we need to handle is HostCmd\_CMD\_802\_11\_SCAN before the command HostCmd\_CMD\_802\_11\_SNMP\_MIB comes. Below is the whole process from disassociation to trigger kernel driver vulnerability.

![](/en/img/exploiting-wifi-stack-on-tesla-model-s/image20.png)

The event and command packet can be sent directly by operating the register SDIO\_CardStatus and SDIO\_SQReadBaseAddress0. The register SDIO\_SQWriteBaseAddress0 at 0x80000114 is useful for processing the data received from the kernel driver.

## Command Execute in Linux System

As Linux Kernel 2.6.36 does not support NX, itâs possible to execute the shellcode on stack directly. In the meantime, the type of size in structure HostCmd\_DS\_COMMAND is u16, so the shellcode can be big enough to do lots of things.

After triggered vulnerability and controlled $PC, $R7 points to the kernel stack. It is very convenient to jump to the shellcode.

The function run\_linux\_cmd in shellcode called Usermode Helper API to execute Linux commands.

## Get Shell Remotely

After triggering the vulnerability in chip, the whole RAM region corrupted, and the firmware cannot work anymore. Besides, the kernel stack is corrupted and needs to be repaired.

To make the wireless function of Parrot works again properly, we did these things:

1. After sending the kernel payload through the SDIO interface, we reset the chip by running the following code. Later, the kernel driver finds the chip and redownload the firmware.

| ``` 123 ``` | ``` *(unsigned int *)0x8000201c|=2;*(unsigned int *)0x8000a514=0;*(unsigned int *)0x80003034=1; ``` |
| --- | --- |

2. Call kernel function rtnl\_unlock() in shellcode function fun\_ret() to unlock rtnl\_mutex which locked before wlan\_enable\_11d() called, or the wireless function in Linux will hangs, result in Parrot reboot by CID.

3. Call kernel function do\_exit() in shellcode function fun\_ret() to kill the user-mode process wpa\_supplicant and restart it, so we donât need to repair the kernel stack.

4. Kill process ck5050 and start again, or ck5050 segment fault due to chip reset, result in Parrot reboot by CID.

To get shell remotely, we force Parrot to connect to our AP and alter iptables rules. Then, the shell listened on port 23 can be reached.

Finally, the success rate of getting a shell is about 10%.

## Complete Exploit process

1. The attacker sends DEAUTH frames to all the AP nearby.
2. When Tesla reconnects to AP, the attacker gets the MAC address of Tesla.
3. Spray the fake pointer, then trigger the vulnerability in firmware by directly send corrupt Action Frame.
4. The function memcpy() executed until interrupt occurs.
5. Gain code execution in the Wi-Fi chip.
6. Stage 1 shellcode sends the event EVENT\_DISASSOCIATED to the driver.
7. Stage 1 shellcode handles some commands and waits for the command HostCmd\_CMD\_802\_11\_SNMP\_MIB.
8. Stage 1 shellcode sends the payload to trigger the kernel stack overflow through the SDIO interface.
9. Stage 2 shellcode executed and invoke the kernel function call\_usermodehelper().
10. Linux system command executed and try to fix the wireless function of Parrot.
11. Attacker setups an AP and a DHCP server in this AP
12. Linux system command forces the Parrot to join our AP and alter the iptables rules.
13. The attacker can telnet to port 23 on Parrot.

Wi-Fi features and main scenarios (FC6050W)
The Parrot module can either be configured as a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP), a Wi-Fi
station (client) or can be used in ad-hoc mode. As an access point, up to 8 devices can
be connected simultaneously.
The host is responsible for:
• enabling/disabling Wi-Fi
• configuring the security level (WEP, WPA, WPA2), and associated passes
• retrieving network information as needed (example: which users are connected)
The FC6050W manages the Wi-Fi network according to the host commands.
Regardless, the FC6050W is responsible for:
• taking care of low-level networking tasks
• keeping the host informed of networking events
There are a lot of different possible use cases, you’ll find below an overview of the main ones. For
more details, please refer to the part 14

3G USB Dongle
Parrot currently supports over 200 3G dongles worldwide. Compatibility testing is done
continually to verify interoperability with new dongles on the market. Test teams are present
is in the US, Europe, Japan, Korea and China.
USB Tethering
As for DUN and PAN, the device acts as a modem and provides the data to the module over
USB. Feature availability is provider and OS dependant. Parrot currently supports Android,
iOS, RIM and Symbian OS.
Wi-Fi Tethering
Any mobile device supporting Wi-Fi access point feature can be used by Parrot module as
an additional internet source. This feature has to be enabled by the network provider.
6.2
Parrot router:
In order to provide flexible network handling and configuration, Parrot developed a router
embedded on the FC6050.
It allows the host to connect any network interface available on the FC6050 (Wi-Fi, 3G
modem, DUN/PAN via BT, Tethering over USB, HOST). It is configurable through a user
friendly set of AT commands (Parrot’s HSTI) and makes it possible to enable internet
services (ftp, vnc, http, for example) on each interface.
6.3
Miscellaneous
The FC6050W needs to be informed of the provider’s DNS (Domain Name Server) IP
address. This information is transmitted to the FC6050W via an HSTI command.
Parrot's FC6050W does not do filtering (firewalling) on the host provided network
transactions, except what may be needed for its own safety. Hence, if some filtering must be
done for network operator or any other reason, it shall be done by the host. Thus, the host is
responsible for the incoming network traffic. Examples include blocking incoming
connections, restricting use to http and https protocols, forbidding POP/IMAP use, blocking
VOIP etc. (these examples come from common phone operator contractual regulations).

7 Host to FC6050B/W interface details
The architecture relies on 4 key features:
1. Using USB as a fast, standard physical medium – USB is used to exchange
commands, events, and user data between the host and Parrot's Wi-Fi enabled
FC6050W. A USB 2.0 High Speed link has a bandwidth of 480 Megabits per second
(60 Megabytes per second). Even with upper layer protocol overhead needed by the
USB physical medium, there is more than enough room for a quality network
connection. [As a point of reference, a typical PC network interface card (NIC) is
100Mbs. A full-blown heavy duty network server has 1000Mbs (1Giga bit per second)
NICs.]
2. Standard networking over USB protocols - Just as serial lines have been used as
the physical medium for networking for years (reference Point-to-Point Protocol), USB
can be used as the physical medium for standard TCP/IP networking. CDC ECM
(Communication Device Class, Ethernet Control Model) is the USB - Implementers
Forum standard for such use. Using such protocols, the USB connection appears to
the operating system as a Network Interface Card (NIC), ready to carry Ethernet
frames. From then on, all rich TCP/IP protocol stacks are available.
3. Parrot's HSTI library uses networking as its logical medium - The Parrot Host
Software Interface (HSTI) library (see section 8) uses a network socket interface,
allowing command and event communication as on a network.
4. An inner, user-hidden network – This connection simply consists of just two nodes:
•
the host processor
•
Parrot’s Wi-Fi enabled OEM module.
The car information and entertainment system can be referred to as the host, and
Parrot's FC6050W module as the target. However, from a USB bus perspective (i.e.
according to USB standard terminology):
•
the host is considered a “USB device”
•
the Parrot's FC6050W target module is considered a “USB host”
The USB terminology of “USB host” and “USB device” does not interfere with the notion
of master / slave from a system perspective, but rather is a matter of hardware and
operating system stack configuration.
The networking architecture can be done using FC6050W as an USB device, and the
host as the USB host. However, in such a case, the use of USB media devices (for
example, MTP or USB flash drive with media files) cannot be done by the FC6050W,
even if a USB hub is used.
7.1
UART
Alternatively, if no USB port is available on the Host side, a serial port can be used to
control the FC6050 using Parrot’s HSTI command and control interface over UART.

7.2
Protocols used
Two types of protocols are used:
1. Standard networking over USB protocol, carrying both HTSI and internet data.
2. The Parrot's HSTI command and events protocol.
7.3
Standard networking over USB protocol for data transmission
The FC6050W handles a USB protocol named CDC ECM (Communication Device
Class, Ethernet Control Model) for networking over USB.
CDC ECM is the USB-Implementers Forum SIG standard for networking Ethernet over
USB. Widely used for cable DSL modem and USB-Ethernet dongles before the domestic
use of NIC became widespread, it has been an official part of the Linux OS since 2003.
CDC ECM goal is to use a USB connection to mimic NICs cards between a USB host
and a USB device, with their MAC and configurable IP addresses, able to convey any
Ethernet frames. These NICs can then be set up and used as any regular network card
would be. From a Linux application point of view, there isn’t any difference between a
USB CDC ECM network connection and a regular one. Actually, the Linux application is
not even aware of physical media used (USB rather Ethernet), since this media is hidden
behind the networking stack of the Linux OS.
RNDIS (Remote Network Driver Interface Specification) is Microsoft vendor-specific,
non-standard way to carry Ethernet over USB. Although RNDIS is not recommended,
RNDIS may be used as a replacement for CDC ECM.
8 Software interface, HSTI Library
The FC6050x software interface, HSTI Library, is defined by a high level command set
on top of Parrot Libraries.
This interface software is based on the HSTI commands defined by Parrot. These
commands are fully documented and the software library is provided by Parrot for easy
implementation in the host CPU.
Some commands are used to manage Bluetooth related functions like device pairing and
connection management as well as the acoustic and speech recognition functions.
Other commands are used to manage Music connected on USB ports.
The HSTI Command List and Bluetooth AT Command Software Specification are
available upon request.
The Bluetooth software stack, BLUES, supports Unicode, which allows the management
of language accents and allows for phonebook management in any language.

8.1
Parrot’s HSTI protocol for network connectivity
HSTI is Parrot's standard API used over its product range. It provides a rich yet simple,
fully documented set of more than 250 high-level commands to pilot the FC6050. The
host sends AT commands, and registers to events to be notified of changes occurring in
the FC6050.
HSTI is available and used on Linux operating system.
HSTI can be used over a network socket or a serial line (UART).
Some HSTI commands are specifically designed to handle network connectivity. For
examples, see the document “Parrot Host Software Interface Specification”. Some
networking commands are exemplified below.
The following steps are required in order for the host CPU to establish a dialog and take
command of the FC6050;
1. Setup the USB link to FC6050 as CDC ECM.
2. Configure this new Ethernet interface (IP address, netmask, broadcast address). For
ease of use, and since there is no added value in making these parameters dynamic,
these IP parameters should be fixed in the product (example 192.168.64.1) - to be
discussed with Parrot.
3. In the host application, open a standard internet socket. This socket will be used to
communicate with the FC6050 via HSTI. The port used for this socket should be a
fixed one, that does not interfere with any commonly used protocol (example value:
23000) – to be discussed with Parrot. From this point, regarding communication to
the FC6050, the host application will not have to care about networking any more.
The socket and USB network connection will be used transparently between the 2
CPUs to carry all HSTI dialog.
4. Register to HSTI events for notification. Events can either be responses from FC6050
to explicit host commands, or unsolicited, asynchronous events such as “new USB
stick insertion”, or “3G dongle insertion”.
5. The host can then send commands to the FC6050 using the HSTI API.
Regarding networking, some additional steps are required. As an example, if the internet
connectivity comes from a 3G dongle plugged into the FC6050 (see section 4, scenario
2):
• The FC6050 shall notify the host of the availability of the 3G dongle by sending an
event.
• If the host decides to enable the internet connection, it prompts the user, for the PIN
code. The prompt and PIN entry is done through the host user interface (screen and
keyboard or touch screen).
• The host sends the PIN code to the FC6050, via an HSTI command.
• The FC6050 manages the 3G dongle, and reports connection status to the host
(example: connection established, or PIN code rejected)
DATASHEET
Confidential Information
18/84
Ref: EL-2009-009
Some things to notice:
• The host may choose to make the internet connection available to the FC6050 Wi-Fi
access point or not. In all cases, the host is in command to dynamically enable or
disable capabilities via the FC6050.
• If the internet connectivity comes from the host (section 4, scenario 1), then the DNS
IP address has to be sent to the FC6050, using the dedicated HSTI command.
• If the host requires internet connectivity for itself from the FC6050 (section 4, third
scenario), then it should do so explicitly and query the FC6050 for the DNS address,
again using the dedicated HSTI commands.
• Internet connectivity provided by the FC6050 (second and third use case) is not “all or
nothing”. It can be used for;
o Wi-Fi access point only
o host only
o both Wi-Fi access point and host use
o disabled
In all relevant cases, the internet networking traffic between the host and the FC6050 will
use the same network interface established before via USB CDC ECM to carry HSTI
commands. This is done transparently so that applications, either on host or on the
FC6050, do not need to handle it (unless of course the host application is willing to do
so).
As a benefit inherited from its rooted serial line interface, the network traffic generated by
the HSTI dialog is extremely low: a typical HSTI query or reply ends up in a dozen or
less bytes of payload. Thus, this HSTI traffic does not interfere with the network
bandwidth available to Wi-Fi users or the host.
Here is an example demonstrating a typical host-side HSTI sequence to setup Wi-Fi,
choose a security level and setup a Wi-Fi network name:
/* set the Wi-Fi “on”, Access Point mode : */
HSTI_CmdAPI_Send_WSWM(AP);
/* Send access point configuration : set the security protocol to WPA */
HSTI_CmdAPI_SendWAPC(SET, SECURITY, WPA);
/* Access point configuration : the SSID naming the Wi-Fi network is “my car network” */
HSTI_CmdAPI_SendWAPC_STR(SET, SSID, “my car network”);

SVOX Automotive TTS solutions are tailored for noisy car environments and enjoy a
reputation for industry-leading quality. They power many of the most advanced and
successful in-dash infotainment systems in the market. SVOX TTS technology is
characterized by natural and clear sound as well as unique polyglot capability – the
same voice can speak multiple languages like a native speaker.
SVOX TTS is not limited in vocabulary. It can be used to confirm the orders identified by
a voice recognition process or for reading vehicle commands, songs titles or phonebook
entries.
Abbreviations, tags, symbols (emoticons) are converted into readable text (grapheme-tographeme conversion). In addition, the SVOX TTS engine contains an advanced text
pre-processor that automatically handles common specifications for date and time.
SVOX provides an excellent quality prosody (i.e. sentence intonation) using state-of-theart prosody modelling technology. Accent values, phrase types, and phrase boundary
positions are taken into account for the determination of the speech melody (pitch
contour) and sound durations.

Voice Recognition for Music Data on external sources
10.4.1
RAP
RAP is an optional Parrot-developed voice recognition gateway. In combination with the
voice recognition option and the CONCERTOS software option it provides the user the
ability to select music on multiple external sources and to operate player functionalities
by voice commands. RAP allows recognition by album title, music type (genre) or artist
name regardless of where the media file resides.
The voice recognition latency is, on average, 1.8 seconds for a database size of 20,000
Albums or Artists. The latency can be improved by reducing the number of Albums or
Artists (~1s for 10 000). Based on trials with the French Parrot test database the voice
recognition accuracy is ~ 85 %.
The maximum number of recognizable items depends on the available memory.
10.4.2
Gracenote® for Music Data on external sources
Gracenote's technology is being relied on by many of the world's leading consumer
electronic devices and media software applications. Gracenote uses a multi-step
recognition method to enable identification, categorization, and organization of digital
music. Regardless of source or format, Gracenote gives music fans the tools to manage
and enjoy their music collections.
10.4.2.1
MediaVOCS TM
MediaVOCS, provided by Gracenote, is an advanced speech-based media database.
This database includes phonetic transcriptions for alternate artist, album and track
names. Even common names are often multiethnic, abbreviated or nicknames which
cannot be recognized by a standard voice recognition database. Based on Parrot
studies, adding Gracenote MediaVOCS to the voice recognition improves the recognition
rate by a factor of 33% on artist names and 16% on album names.

to work with MediaVOCS, Playlist Plus analyzes the metadata for music brought into the
vehicle and offers a variety of playlists for the music library. These playlists may be
either pre-set or user customized. In addition, the user may select “More Like This” and
hear other songs in the music library of a similar genre to the song currently playing.
10.4.3
Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
The Parrot FC6XX0 product line offers an advanced voice recognition system based on
Grammar based NLU (Natural Language Understanding, VoCon3200 version 3.3 )
With NLU, the user has the ability to control various vehicle feature by voice without
"being constrained" by traditional voice recognition menu trees or categories (music,
phone book, ...).
All Parrot features and other vehicle functions can be controlled via voice from the press
of a single “push-to-talk” (PTT) button.
With NLU, the user can skip the step of narrowing the choices:
• Selection of Phone Number from Phonebook
• “I want to call John Smith”
• “Call John Smith”
• “Call John Smith at home”
• “Call Smith at the office”
• “Call John Smith on Mobile
• Selection of Music from Music Library
• “Play something from John Mayer”
• “Play Parachutes from Coldplay”
• “Play Bob Marley” [Note: this command works even though the official artist name is
“Bob Marley and the Whalers”]
• “Play Jazz”
• “Play Alternative”
• “Play Super Hits of Miles Davis
These are just a sample of what is possible with NLU.
Other features, not residing on the Parrot FC6XX0 module can also benefit from NLU.
This includes use cases such as tuning of a radio station or activating a rear-camera
