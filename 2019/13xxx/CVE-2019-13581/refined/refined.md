             "exploitation": "The exploitation process involves first triggering the firmware vulnerability to achieve code execution on the Wi-Fi chip. Then, the compromised chip is used to trigger the driver vulnerability, which leads to code execution on the host Linux system. The exploit involves spraying memory with shellcode, and then overwriting a function pointer to execute this shellcode on the Wi-Fi chip.  The exploit for the driver vulnerability takes advantage of the fact that the chip can return a different command ID, then a stack buffer overflow is triggered during the processing of an 802.11 SNMP MIB command after a forced disassociation by the compromised chip."
