Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13607:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of navigation to "javascript:" URLs via the "location" header in the Opera Mini browser for iOS. Instead of preventing or sanitizing such navigations, the browser executes the provided JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Universal Cross-Site Scripting (U-XSS):** The browser executes the JavaScript code in the context of the domain from where the navigation was initiated, rather than the attacker's domain. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a target website, as long as they can initiate a navigation from the target website to an attacker-controlled domain.
*   **Improper Handling of "javascript:" URLs:**  The browser fails to prevent or sanitize the "javascript:" protocol when provided in the "location" header, directly executing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a target domain.
*   **Data theft/manipulation:**  Attackers could potentially steal sensitive user data, manipulate website content, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions that would otherwise be prevented by the browser's same-origin policy.
*   **Account Takeover:** If the target website has vulnerabilities, the attacker can exploit the XSS to perform actions on behalf of the victim or gain control of the victim's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Navigation via "location" header:** The vulnerability is triggered when a navigation occurs to a URL with the "javascript:" protocol specified in the "location" header of a HTTP response.
*   **Redirection:** Attackers can use an open redirect vulnerability or their own website to redirect a user to the malicious "javascript:" URL via the "location" header.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can post links on any website to initiate the navigation from that website context and execute their javascript in that context by simply performing the redirect to "javascript" protocol with attacker's javascript code via "location" header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control a Server:** The attacker needs to control a server that can return a HTTP response with a "location" header containing the malicious "javascript:" URL.
*   **Social Engineering/Open Redirect:** The attacker must be able to trick a user into clicking a link that initiates navigation from the target website to the attacker controlled server, or an open redirect on a legitimate site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in Opera Mini for iOS version 16.0.14.
*   The blog post provides a practical demonstration of the vulnerability, showing how it can be used to execute JavaScript in the context of websites like "rakeshmane.com" and "google.com".
*   The author of the blog post reported the vulnerability to Opera, but the issue was not fixed at the time of the blog post publication.
