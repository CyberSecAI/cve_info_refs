SSA-686531: Hardware based manufacturing access on S7-1200 and
S7-200 SMART

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.8

2019-11-12

V1.2

SUMMARY

There is an access mode used during manufacturing of SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-200 SMART CPUs
that allows additional diagnostic functionality. Using this functionality requires physical access to the CPU
during boot process.

If additional protection from unauthorized use is needed Siemens provides speciﬁc countermeasures via
an update of the device boot loader.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products of the SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous control in
industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

The S7-200 SMART series is a line of micro-programmable logic controllers that can control a variety of
small automation applications.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13945

There is an access mode used during manufacturing of the affected devices that allows additional
diagnostic functionality.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with physical access to the UART interface
during boot process.
