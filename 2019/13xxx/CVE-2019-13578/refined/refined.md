Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities addressed in the commits:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The code was vulnerable to SQL injection because it did not properly sanitize or validate the `orderby` and `order` parameters used in database queries. This allowed attackers to potentially inject malicious SQL code through these parameters.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code lacked proper validation of the `orderby` and `order` parameters before using them in SQL queries.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The code directly incorporated user-provided parameters into SQL queries, instead of using prepared statements or parameterized queries, which are safer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data by injecting SQL queries designed to extract information from the database.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could execute resource-intensive queries to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET/POST parameters:** An attacker could manipulate the `orderby` and `order` parameters in HTTP requests to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
*   The attacker must identify the vulnerable parameters (`orderby` and `order`) in the application.

**Specific Vulnerabilities Addressed in Commits:**

*   **Commit `894937d`**:
    *   **File:** `includes/donors/class-give-donors-query.php`
    *   **Fix:**  The code now checks if the `orderby` parameter exists in a whitelist of valid columns (`$table_columns`). If it does not, the parameter is unset. It also applies `esc_sql()` to both the orderby and order parameters, which sanitizes the SQL to prevent injection.
*   **Commit `d91f4c6`**:
    *   **File:** `includes/payments/class-payments-query.php`
    *   **Fix:** Validates the `order` parameter, ensuring it is either 'ASC' or 'DESC'. If not, it defaults to 'DESC'. This prevents arbitrary values from being passed and used directly in the SQL query.
*    **Commit `97b9b5f`**:
    *   **File:** `includes/payments/class-payments-query.php`
    *   **Fix:** This commit whitelists the `orderby` parameter. If the `orderby` parameter does not match an allowed key, it defaults to `ID`. This prevents arbitrary SQL injection using the orderby parameter.

**Summary:** The commits provided fix SQL injection vulnerabilities by implementing input validation and sanitization for `orderby` and `order` parameters used in database queries. These changes restrict the values allowed, and sanitize them preventing attackers from injecting malicious code through the parameters.
