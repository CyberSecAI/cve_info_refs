- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application accepts arbitrary file extensions during the creation of a support ticket, allowing an attacker to upload malicious files. This, combined with the application's failure to set cookie flags programmatically, enables the execution of Javascript code from uploaded files and allows for cookie theft.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Insecure file upload handling, lack of proper cookie flag settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can steal or manipulate user sessions and cookies, potentially leading to impersonation of a legitimate user. They can also redirect the victim or perform other malicious operations.  Specifically, an attacker can gain admin privileges by stealing the admin's session cookie.
- **Attack vectors**: By uploading a malicious SVG file through the create ticket functionality, the attacker injects malicious JavaScript which is executed when the file is accessed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any authentication, they only need to access the create ticket functionality of osTicket 1.10.1.
