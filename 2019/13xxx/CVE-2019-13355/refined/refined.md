Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of the `dotnetproxy.exe` executable within the Total Defense Antivirus software. Specifically, the application's update process allows for the replacement of the legitimate `dotnetproxy.exe` with a malicious executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Handling:** The vulnerability is a result of the lack of proper integrity checks during the update process, allowing an attacker to overwrite the legitimate `dotnetproxy.exe` with a malicious file. This is a file replacement vulnerability.
- **Lack of Authenticity Verification:** There is no verification mechanism in place to ensure that the new `dotnetproxy.exe` is a genuine file signed by Total Defense.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** By replacing `dotnetproxy.exe` with a malicious executable, the attacker can gain SYSTEM level privileges on the target machine. Because the `dotnetproxy.exe` is run with elevated privileges, the attacker's payload will also execute with those privileges, allowing the attacker to perform any action they desire on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Replacement:** The attacker needs to replace the legitimate `dotnetproxy.exe` file located at `%programdata%\TotalDefense\Consumer\ISS\9` with a malicious executable.
- **Triggering the Update Process:** After file replacement the attacker must trigger the update process which can be done by either initiating a software update or executing `ccupdate.exe`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine in order to replace the `dotnetproxy.exe` file.
- **Write Permissions:** The attacker must have write permissions to the directory containing `dotnetproxy.exe` to replace the executable.
