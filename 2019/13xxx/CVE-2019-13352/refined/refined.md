{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The WolfVision Cynap wireless collaboration and presentation system uses a static, hard-coded cryptographic secret for generating support PINs used for the provided 'forgot password' functionality.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can reset the password of the administrative user account \"ADMIN\" and thus gain unauthorized access to the affected Cynap device via a network connection.",
    "attack_vectors": "By knowing the static secret and the corresponding algorithm, an attacker can generate support PINs to reset the administrative password.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the static secret and the algorithm used for calculating support PINs. This can be done by analyzing the firmware or other methods. The attacker also needs network access to the device."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "affected_versions": [
      "1.18g",
      "1.28j"
    ],
    "solution": "Install the firmware version 1.30j provided by the manufacturer WolfVision.",
     "poc": "SySS GmbH developed a software tool for generating support PINs either in online or offline mode. A proof-of-concept video demonstrating a successful attack is available.",
