{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `wfloat()` function when formatting a floating-point number using `sprintf`",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The overflow can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file that causes `wfloat()` to format a floating-point number with a length that exceeds the allocated buffer size.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious input file to the vulnerable dpic application."
