# Stack-based Buffer Overflow in the wfloat() function

Hi,

While fuzzing dpic with American Fuzzy Lop, I found a Stack-based Buffer
Overflow in the wfloat() function, in main.c.

Attaching a reproducer, issue can be reproduced by running:

```
dpic test01
```

[test01](/-/project/5973503/uploads/920147806a27bb9648a0000ccae21e43/test01)

```
