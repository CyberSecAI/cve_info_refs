The provided content describes a global buffer overflow vulnerability in the `nxt_utf8_decode` function within the `nxt/nxt_utf8.c` file of the njs project.

- **Root Cause:** A global buffer overflow occurs in the `nxt_utf8_decode` function at line 72 of `nxt/nxt_utf8.c`. This is triggered by a specific JavaScript test case involving regular expression replacement and string manipulation.
- **Vulnerability:** Global buffer overflow.
- **Impact:** The overflow leads to a crash, as detected by AddressSanitizer (ASAN). The ASAN log indicates a read of size 1 occurs outside the bounds of a global variable.
- **Attack Vector:** A crafted JavaScript input, specifically designed to exploit the string replacement logic involving regular expressions, triggers the overflow.
- **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious JavaScript code to the njs engine.
