Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-13483:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `passport-sharepoint` library not validating the JWT signature of an Access Token before processing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Lack of JWT Signature Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper verification of the JWT signature, making it susceptible to forgery.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Bypass Authentication and Authorization:** Attackers can forge tokens, successfully bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms. This allows unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Forged JWT Tokens:** An attacker could create a malicious, fabricated JWT token to impersonate a legitimate user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to Forge JWTs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a valid JWT (except for the signature part), which the vulnerable library would accept.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in `passport-sharepoint` versions prior to 0.4.0.
- Auth0 has deprecated and will no longer maintain this library, advising users to discontinue its use.
- The fix involves upgrading the library to version 0.4.0, which includes the necessary JWT signature validation.
