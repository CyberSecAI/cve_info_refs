Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from issues in the CGI parsing code within the Xymon network monitoring application. Specifically, there are multiple issues including buffer overflows and XSS vulnerabilities present in CGI scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The CGI parsing code is susceptible to buffer overflows.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The CGI parsing code also suffers from XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Remote attackers can cause a denial of service.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The vulnerabilities can lead to "any other unspecified impact," suggesting the possibility of further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable by remote attackers.
*   **CGI Parsing Code:** The attack vector is through the CGI parsing code of the Xymon application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable CGI scripts. This implies network access to the Xymon server running the vulnerable CGI scripts.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also indicates that multiple CVEs were addressed in the same update, suggesting a systemic issue within the CGI parsing.
*   The github content shows the source code of the `appfeed.c` file which is one of the vulnerable CGI scripts. This file shows the parsing of query parameters which can lead to the vulnerability.
*   The fix involves upgrading to Xymon version 4.3.29 or later.
