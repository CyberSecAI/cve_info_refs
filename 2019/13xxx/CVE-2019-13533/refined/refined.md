Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-13533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper protection against capture and replay attacks in the communication protocol used by Omron PLCs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass by Capture-Replay (CWE-294):** An attacker can intercept network traffic between the PLC and a controller and replay captured requests. This bypasses authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised Integrity and Availability:** By replaying commands, an attacker could open/close industrial valves or potentially manipulate other processes controlled by the PLC, leading to disrupted operations and potential physical damage.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Limited information disclosure related to the specific values used to control the PLC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the PLC and its controller. This could be achieved by network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker must be able to monitor network traffic between the PLC and its controller. This might be achievable by being on the same network or gaining access to the network.
- **Traffic Monitoring/Sniffing Capabilities:** The attacker needs tools and capabilities to capture network packets.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability affects Omron PLC CJ and CS series (all versions).
- The provided text also lists mitigations such as filtering traffic on the FINS port and filtering access by IP address.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.1, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H) which indicates high severity.
