Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13571:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly references `CVE-2019-13571` within the file path and README of a GitHub repository, indicating that the content is indeed related to this CVE. Additionally, the content from `wordpress.org` and `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` provides information about the vulnerable plugin `Advanced Contact Form 7 DB` mentioned in the GitHub repo.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is identified as a SQL injection flaw in the `Advanced Contact Form 7 DB` WordPress plugin. This is highlighted by the following:
     -  The `README.md` file in the GitHub repo mentions: "The affected software is a WP plugin named `Advanced Contact form 7 DB`. In here you can find a POC for `CVE-2019-13571` that I discovered during my research."
     -  The changelog for plugin version 1.6.2 states: "We have fixed SQL injection related bugs at the back office query."
     -  The code diff from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` shows changes to `contact_form_listing.php`, specifically sanitizing user input before using it in a SQL query, which is directly related to SQL injection prevention.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of unsanitized user-supplied data being used in SQL queries, making the plugin susceptible to SQL injection attacks. The vulnerable code was in the admin panel that handles the display of contact form submission data.
   - The code diff shows a modification to sanitize the `order` and `orderby` parameters from the URL (`$_GET`) using `esc_sql()` before using them in a database query. Without sanitization, an attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code into these parameters.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker could potentially:
     - **Extract sensitive data:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker could query the database for sensitive information, such as user details or other confidential data stored by the plugin or WordPress.
     - **Modify data:** With a successful SQL injection, an attacker could modify data stored in the database, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation of contact form submissions.
     - **Gain administrative access:** It's plausible that by chaining the SQLi with other attacks, an attacker could potentially gain administrative access to the WordPress site. The provided screenshots also show options to export data which could include sensitive information.
   - The content also indicates that the plugin stores form data, including IP addresses and file uploads. This makes the stored data a prime target for extraction.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **HTTP GET Parameters:** The vulnerability was exploited via unsanitized `orderby` and `order` parameters in the URL, likely within the WordPress admin dashboard where contact form data is displayed. This means the attack vector is through a crafted URL request targeting the vulnerable plugin's admin interface.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Authenticated Access:** The attacker likely needs to be logged into the WordPress dashboard (possibly as a lower-level admin or editor user) to access the vulnerable plugin's admin panel. This assumes the plugin data viewing panel is restricted to logged-in users.
    - **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:**  The attacker needs to understand which parameters are vulnerable and how to inject malicious SQL code, this knowledge could be gained from the publicly available POC.
    - **Network Access:** Standard HTTP access to the WordPress site's admin panel.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The content provides a good example of how a seemingly minor vulnerability like a SQL injection can lead to a severe security breach.
    - The plugin had security updates over the lifetime of the code as seen in the changelogs and patch notes.
    - The identified fix shows the use of `esc_sql` to sanitize the inputs and is a basic practice in web development to protect from SQL injection.
