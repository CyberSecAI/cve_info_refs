  "CVE-2019-13345": {
    "description": "Squid is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the user_name or auth parameter in the cachemgr.cgi web module.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Squid cachemgr.cgi web module"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The cachemgr.cgi web module has insufficient sanitization of the `user_name` and `auth` parameters, which allows for XSS injection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized input parameters in the cachemgr.cgi web module."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request containing malicious JavaScript within the user_name or auth parameters to a vulnerable Squid server.",
        "The attack is initiated via a crafted HTTP GET request to the cachemgr.cgi component. The user_name and auth parameters within this request are not properly sanitized, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary JavaScript code."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable Squid server and manipulate the `user_name` or `auth` parameters. No user interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability, other than the target system accessing the crafted URL. The attacker can be unauthenticated."
    ,
    "additional_information": [
      "The vulnerability is present due to the lack of sanitization on user-supplied parameters. Specifically the parameters `user_name` and `auth` in `cachemgr.cgi` are not sanitized correctly.",
       "Squid versions 2.x through 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x through 3.5.28, and 4.x through 4.7 are affected.",
      "cachemgr.cgi is not used by default in some setups, and the exploit may be limited if usernames are not displayed on error pages."
     ]
