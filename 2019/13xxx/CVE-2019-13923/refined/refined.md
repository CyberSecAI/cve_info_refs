- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The integrated configuration web server of the affected device is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of the IE/WSN-PA Link WirelessHART Gateway.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring a user to access a malicious link while logged into the device's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing a malicious link. The user needs to be logged into the web interface for the exploit to succeed.
