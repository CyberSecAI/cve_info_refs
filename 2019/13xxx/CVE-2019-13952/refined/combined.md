## Description

![@fcambus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825456?v=4&size=48)[fcambus](https://github.com/fcambus)opened [on Jul 18, 2019](https://github.com/gdnsd/gdnsd/issues/185#issue-469763988)

Hi,

I found two occurences of stack-based buffer overflow when fuzzing gdnsd

with American Fuzzy Lop.

1. The first occurence happens in the set\_ipv4() function, in zscan\_rfc1035.rl,

   and can be triggered with the following input:

```
ns1.all.rr.org.         IN      A               10.1.0.529999999999999999999999999999999

```

The issue can be be reproduced by creating a 'zones' directory, putting

the above input in a file within the 'zones' directory, and running:

```
gdnsd -c . checkconf

```

Because no bounds checking is being done in the set\_ipv4() function, 'len'

ends up being larger than 16:

```
static void set_ipv4(zscan_t* z, const char* end)
{
    char txt[16];
    unsigned len = end - z->tstart;
    memcpy(txt, z->tstart, len);

```

It seems your parser is attempting to parse malformed IPv4 addresses until

there is no input left, as I have been able to get 'len' to reach very

large values when generating malformed IPv4 address strings spawning several

gigabytes, which gdnsd will happily attempt to parse.

2. The second occurence happens in the set\_ipv6() function, in zscan\_rfc1035.rl,

   and can be triggered with the following input:

```
ns1.all.rr.org.         IN      AAAA            2001:67c:2e8:22::c100:68b:2001:67c:2e8:22::c100:68:2001:67c:2e8:22::c100:68b

```

Because no bounds checking is being done in the set\_ipv6() function, 'len'

ends up being larger than INET6\_ADDRSTRLEN + 1:

```
static void set_ipv6(zscan_t* z, const char* end)
{
    char txt[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN + 1];
    unsigned len = end - z->tstart;
    memcpy(txt, z->tstart, len);

```

As previously, the parser will happily parse malformed IPv6 address strings

spawning several gigabytes.
