The content is related to CVE-2019-13952.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of bounds checking in the `set_ipv4()` and `set_ipv6()` functions within `zscan_rfc1035.rl`. These functions use `memcpy` to copy data into fixed-size buffers without verifying the length of the input data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stack-based buffer overflows are present in the `set_ipv4()` and `set_ipv6()` functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploiting these buffer overflows could lead to arbitrary code execution due to overwriting data on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve providing specially crafted malformed IPv4 or IPv6 addresses within DNS zone files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide malicious input to gdnsd through the zone files. The attacker needs to control the content of the zone files to trigger the vulnerability when `gdnsd` is running and parsing the zone files. The issue can be triggered by using the `gdnsd -c . checkconf` command after creating a 'zones' directory and placing the malicious input within a file inside this directory.
