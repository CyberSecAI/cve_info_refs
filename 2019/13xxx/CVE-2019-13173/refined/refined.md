Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-13173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `fstream.DirWriter()` function within the `fstream` library for Node.js. This function incorrectly handles hard links in tar archives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The core weakness is the ability to overwrite arbitrary files on the file system.
- **Incorrect Hardlink Handling:** The `fstream.DirWriter()` doesn't properly validate or handle hard links when extracting tarballs, which leads to the overwrite issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite existing files on the system, potentially leading to:
    - Data loss
    - System compromise
    - Denial of service
- **Privilege Escalation:** If a system file is overwritten, it could be used to elevate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Tarballs:** The primary attack vector is through crafted tar archives that include hard links.
- **File Extraction:**  The vulnerability is triggered when a vulnerable version of `fstream` extracts a maliciously crafted tarball.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create and Distribute Malicious Archives:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted tar archive with malicious hard links.
- **Access to a System Running Vulnerable Code:** The attacker needs a way to get the vulnerable system to extract this archive, which could be through a web application, a script or another automated process.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when a hard link is encountered in a tarball that points to an existing file on the system, and this is followed by a file entry with the same name as the hard link. When this happens, the file content is used to overwrite the original file, potentially including system files.
- The vulnerability is present in `fstream` versions prior to 1.0.12.
- The fix implemented in version 1.0.12 prevents the overwrite by checking if a file already exists at the target location and removing it first.
- This fix has also been backported to other software that utilizes this package.

**Mitigation:**

-  Upgrade to `fstream` version 1.0.12 or later.
-  Be careful when extracting tarballs from untrusted sources.
