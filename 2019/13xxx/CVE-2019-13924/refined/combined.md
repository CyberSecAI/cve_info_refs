SUMMARY

Several SCALANCE X switches contain a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to perform administra-
tive actions if the victim is tricked into clicking on a website controlled by the attacker. The attack only
works if the victim has an authenticated session on the administrative interface of the switch.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Only access links from trusted sources in the browser you use to conﬁgure the SCALANCE X

switches.

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE S-600 devices (S602, S612, S623, S627-2M) are used to protect trusted industrial
networks from untrusted networks. The S-600 devices are superseded by the SCALANCE SC-600
devices (SC622-2C, SC632-2C, SC636-2C, SC642-2C, SC646-2C), or the SCALANCE S615.

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13924

The device does not send the X-Frame-Option Header in the administrative web interface, which
makes it vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker that is able to trick an administrative user
with a valid session on the target device into clicking on a website controlled by the attacker. The
vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform administrative actions via the web interface.
