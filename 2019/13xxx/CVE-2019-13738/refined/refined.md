Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Insufficient policy enforcement in the navigation component of the Chromium browser. This means that the browser did not properly restrict or control navigation-related actions, leading to a security vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability lies in the inadequate implementation of policy enforcement within the navigation system of the Chromium browser. This allowed an attacker to bypass site isolation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to bypass site isolation.  This could lead to information disclosure or other unauthorized actions depending on the context of the affected application and the attacker's further actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, achievable through a crafted HTML page. This implies that the attacker would need to entice a victim to load the malicious page through a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker requires the ability to create and host a specially crafted HTML page. No other special capabilities are required beyond enticing the victim to open the malicious HTML page using a vulnerable version of Chromium.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-13738 is a medium severity vulnerability stemming from insufficient policy enforcement during navigation within the Chromium browser. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to bypass site isolation by convincing a user to visit a crafted HTML page.
