The provided documents contain information about CVE-2019-13616. Here's a breakdown:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Description:** Heap-based buffer over-read in BlitNtoN in `video/SDL_blit_N.c` when called from `SDL_SoftBlit` in `video/SDL_blit.c` in SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) through 1.2.15 and 2.x through 2.0.9. This can occur when processing an invalid BMP image. An integer overflow in `IMA_ADPCM_decode()` in `audio/SDL_wave.c` can also lead to a heap-based buffer over-read in `Fill_IMA_ADPCM_block`.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by missing validation or incorrect handling of image dimensions (specifically, BMP width) and an integer overflow during audio decoding, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted image file (BMP, PCX, XCF, XPM) or a sound file (WAV).
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (application crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Software:** SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) 1.2.15 and 2.x through 2.0.9, and SDL2\_image 2.0.4.

**Affected Fedora Products and Resolutions:**

Fedora 30 and 31 were affected. The vulnerability was addressed by updating the `SDL` and `mingw-SDL2` packages.

**Affected Ubuntu Products and Resolutions:**

Ubuntu 12.04 ESM, 14.04 ESM, 16.04 ESM and 18.04 ESM are affected. The vulnerability was addressed by updating the `libsdl1.2` and `sdl-image1.2` packages to the versions specified in the Ubuntu Security Notices USN-4156-1, USN-4156-2 and USN-4238-1.

**Gentoo Linux:**

The vulnerability was resolved by upgrading the media-libs/libsdl package to version 1.2.15\_p20221201 or later.

**Mitigation:**

Applying the patch to validate image sizes when loading BMP files.
