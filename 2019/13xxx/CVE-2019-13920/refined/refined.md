- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Some parts of the web application lack protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could trigger requests of a logged-in user to the application, potentially switching the connectivity state of a user or device.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be able to trigger requests from a logged-in user. This could be achieved by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to unknowingly send requests to the vulnerable application. This can be done through social engineering tactics or by exploiting other vulnerabilities in the user's environment. The attacker requires no privileges.
