Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS
*   **Location:** `mc-admin/post-edit.php` in MiniCMS.
*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user input in the "tags" box within the post editor.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject a malicious JavaScript payload (e.g., `<script>alert(document.domain)</script>`) into the tags field when creating or editing a post.
*   **Impact:** When a user views the archive page (or any page where the tags are displayed), the stored XSS payload executes, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `post-edit.php` page, which is likely restricted to administrative users.

The report includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to inject the XSS payload and trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2018-10296 but in a different location.
