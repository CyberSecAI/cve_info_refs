  "CVE-2019-13299": {
    "description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has a heap-based buffer over-read at MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h in GetPixelChannel.",
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer over-read occurs in the `GetPixelChannel` function due to an issue with indexing the pixel array using a possibly invalid offset from the `channel_map`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure as an attacker may be able to read data beyond the allocated memory region. It can also cause application crashes, impacting availability.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path when ImageMagick's `GetPixelChannel` function is called.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a specific image to trigger the overflow when it is processed by the ImageMagick library. The attacker needs to be able to cause a user or service to process the malicious image file.",
