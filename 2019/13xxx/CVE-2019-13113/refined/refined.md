Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13113:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an invalid data location within a CRW (Canon Raw) image file. The `exiv2` library attempts to access metadata based on the faulty location, which leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Invalid Data Location:** The CRW image file contains incorrect pointers or offsets to metadata.
-   **Missing Bounds Check:** `exiv2` does not properly validate the calculated data location before accessing the memory, leading to out-of-bounds access.
-   **Assertion Failure:** The library's assertion mechanism triggers when it encounters an invalid data location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted CRW image can cause `exiv2` to crash, preventing it from processing other images. This can lead to a DoS attack if a service relies on `exiv2`.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious Image File:** The attacker needs to provide a CRW image file with specific invalid data location characteristics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must be able to supply the crafted CRW file to a system that uses the vulnerable version of `exiv2`.
-   No special privileges or access is needed to trigger the vulnerability, simply the ability to have the file processed by the vulnerable software.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix involved replacing an assert with `enforce` which throws an exception if the data location is invalid in `CiffComponent::dataLocation(uint16_t tag)` and avoids the crash.
- The vulnerability was present in `exiv2` versions up to 0.27.1.
- The patch was introduced in the `0.27-maintenance` branch of the exiv2 repository with commits 7798ae2, 6212806, and ae949e4 (The commit hashes may be slightly different depending on the branch).
