I'm going to leave it to Dan and Luis to approve. Dan brought enforce() into the code-base.

I believe you're in Oxford. You're very welcome to come to Camberley for a BBQ during the summer. We're going to Scotland and other short trips in the next couple of months. After that, it'd be nice to meet up.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I've grep'ed the source code for invocations of `dataLocation()` and it is only used in very few places. What's your guys opinion on simply making it throw if it should find an invalid location? |

| I think [@D4N](https://github.com/D4N) 's idea is very nice. If you could try to throw inside `CiffComponent::dataLocation(uint16_t tag)` then we could remove all the checks from where `dataLocation()` is used. Could you try to do it in this PR? If we observe complications because of that we can always postpone it. |
