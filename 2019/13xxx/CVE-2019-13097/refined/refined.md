The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Cat Runner: Decorate Home" Android application (version 2.8.0).

*   **Vulnerability:** External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
*   **Root Cause:** The application API does not properly validate inputs that are assumed to be immutable. Specifically, the "score" parameter can be manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Attack Vector:** By modifying the "score" parameter in the POST request to the `/index/commit` endpoint, an attacker can modify the application data and gain benefits (e.g., high score) for their own account.
*   **Impact:** Modification of application data (score).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP request sent by the application to the server. No special privileges are required on the device.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The application uses the `card.matchJplay.com` server.
    *   The vulnerable endpoint is `/index/commit`.
    *   The request is a POST request with `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
    *   The vulnerable parameter is `score`.
    *   The attacker can modify the `score` parameter to an arbitrary value.
