# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# Fun with Fuzzers: How I Discovered Three Vulnerabilities (Part 2 of 3)

July 12, 2019

This is the second in a three-part series that chronicles how I discovered three vulnerabilities over the course of a day. If you haven‚Äôt already, you can go back and read the [first installment](https://salvatoresecurity.com/fun-with-fuzzers-or-how-i-discovered-three-vulnerabilities-part-1-of-3/).

## Introduction

I was surprised when [american fuzzy lop (AFL)](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) quickly found the [first vulnerability](https://salvatoresecurity.com/fun-with-fuzzers-or-how-i-discovered-three-vulnerabilities-part-1-of-3/) in [FlightCrew](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/flightcrew), so you can imagine my elation when it turned up the second in under two hours. This time, instead of a crash, AFL found that FlightCrew hung when it was provided with certain input. I fired up gdbtui and began to investigate.

AFL status

## Vulnerability Analysis

Upon examining the backtrace, it quickly became apparent that the issue was not in FlightCrew itself, but within [Zipios](http://zipios.sourceforge.net/), a third-party library for handling ZIP files. FlightCrew includes a copy of the complete source code from Zipios v0.1.5.9.

In order to understand the root cause of this bug, a brief explanation of the ZIP archive structure is in order. ZIP archives consist of local file headers, file data, and the central directory. Additional metadata is also present but is not pertinent to this discussion.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/ZIP-64_Internal_Layout.svg/800px-ZIP-64_Internal_Layout.svg.png)

[ZIP File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29)

For each file within the ZIP archive, the central directory contains a ‚Äúcentral directory header.‚Äù The last field of a central directory header is an ‚Äúoffset‚Äù that points to the position of the file‚Äôs ‚Äúlocal header.‚Äù Together, the central directory and local file headers contain the information necessary to extract file data from the ZIP archive.

![](https://i0.wp.com/users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip-images/central-file-header.png?w=700&ssl=1)

[Central Directory Header](https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html)

In the fuzzed ZIP file, the ‚ÄúOffset of local header‚Äù field has been changed so that its value is larger than the size of the archive. We can see by examining the code that this leads to an infinite loop.

The central directory is read by the function `ZipFile::readCentralDirectory()`, which reads each central directory header. It then calls `ZipFile::confirmLocalHeaders()`.

#### src/zipios/src/zipfile.cpp

```
bool ZipFile::confirmLocalHeaders( istream &_zipfile ) {
  Entries::const_iterator it ;
  ZipCDirEntry *ent ;
  int inconsistencies = 0 ;
  ZipLocalEntry zlh ;
  for ( it = _entries.begin() ; it != _entries.end() ; it++ ) {
    ent = static_cast< ZipCDirEntry * >( (*it).get()  ) ;
    _vs.vseekg( _zipfile, ent->getLocalHeaderOffset(), ios::beg ) ;
    _zipfile >> zlh ;
    if ( ! _zipfile || zlh != *ent ) {
      inconsistencies++ ;
      _zipfile.clear() ;
    }
  }
  return ! inconsistencies ;
}

```

The call to `ent->getLocalHeaderoffset()` returns the unchecked local header offset value. Because the local header offset is greater than the size of the file, the call to `vseekg()` on line 180 seeks to the end of the file, setting the eofbit error state flag for `_zipfile`. An overloaded `>>` operator is then called on line 181.

#### src/zipios/src/ziphead.cpp

```
std::istream& operator>> ( std::istream &is, ZipCDirEntry &zcdh ) {
  zcdh._valid = false ; // set to true upon successful completion.
  if ( ! is )
    return is ;

  if ( zcdh.signature != readUint32( is ) ) {
    // put stream in error state and return
    is.setstate ( std::ios::failbit ) ;
    return is ;
  }
```
#### src/zipios/zipios++/zipheadio.h

```
inline uint32 readUint32 ( istream &is ) {
  static const int buf_len = sizeof ( uint32 ) ;
  unsigned char buf [ buf_len ] ;
  int rsf = 0 ;
  while ( rsf < buf_len ) {
    is.read ( reinterpret_cast< char * >( buf ) + rsf, buf_len - rsf ) ;
    rsf += static_cast< int >( is.gcount () ) ;
  }
  return  ztohl ( buf ) ;
}

```

Because the previous call to `vgseek()` caused `is` to seek to the end of the file, the call to `is.read()` on line 83 of zipheadio.h fails. Since `is` is at the end of the file, there are no more bytes to read. The call to `is.gcount()` returns 0, and line 84 is, therefore, logically equivalent to `rsf = rsf + 0`. As neither `rsf` nor `is` ever changes, the while loop‚Äôs condition on line 82 will never be true, resulting in an infinite loop.

## Security Impact

Users of the Zipios library (v0.1.5.9 and earlier) are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. As this DoS is caused by an infinite loop, exploitation of this vulnerability can also lead to [uncontrolled resource consumption](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).

The latest version of Zipios (v2.2.1.0) is not vulnerable. Other versions of Zipios have not been analyzed.

## Remediation

This issue is resolved in [v0.1.7](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zipios/files/zipios%2B%2B/0.1.7/) of Zipios. It is recommended that Zipios users upgrade to [v0.1.7](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zipios/files/zipios%2B%2B/0.1.7/) or [v2.2.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zipios/files/zipios%2B%2B/2.2.0/) if possible.

As of July 15, 2019, Ubuntu users have access to a patched version of Zipios v0.1.5.9, as well as a patched version of FlightCrew.

Other Zipios and FlightCrew users can apply the following patch and rebuild: <https://sourceforge.net/p/zipios/code-git/ci/96e26640573410709bb863b8916a8216f4c6a546/tree/infinite_loop.patch>

## Disclosure Timeline

American fuzzy lop discovers that FlightCrew hangs when provided with certain malformed input due to a bug in the Zipios library.

Zipios upstream developers are notified via a secure channel. Upstream developers respond, stating that there is no support for v0.1.5.9 of the Zipios.

A patch is developed by Mike Salvatore and submitted to the upstream developers for review.

The [patch](https://sourceforge.net/p/zipios/code-git/ci/96e26640573410709bb863b8916a8216f4c6a546/tree/infinite_loop.patch) is modified by [Alexis Wilke](https://www.m2osw.com/) and accepted upstream.

[CVE-2019-13453](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13453) is assigned to this vulnerability by MITRE.

# Fun with Fuzzers: How I Discovered Three Vulnerabilities (Part 3 of 3)

July 12, 2019

This is the third part in a three-part series that chronicles how I discovered three vulnerabilities over the course of a day. If you haven‚Äôt already, you can go back and read the first two installments: [Part 1](https://salvatoresecurity.com/fun-with-fuzzers-or-how-i-discovered-three-vulnerabilities-part-1-of-3/) and [Part 2](https://salvatoresecurity.com/fun-with-fuzzers-how-i-discovered-three-vulnerabilities-part-2-of-3/).

## Vulnerability Analysis

In [Part 1](https://salvatoresecurity.com/fun-with-fuzzers-or-how-i-discovered-three-vulnerabilities-part-1-of-3/) of this series, I discussed fuzzing and how it helped me to discover [CVE-2019-13032](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13032) and [CVE-2019-13453](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13453). In my investigation of CVE-2019-13453, I examined the code in [FlightCrew](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/flightcrew) that processes EPUB (ZIP) files from end to end. I noticed that FlightCrew was extracting the EPUB files and writing them to disk. I also noticed that no validation of the extracted file paths was being performed. I began to suspect that FlightCrew might be vulnerable to [Zip Slip](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability).

Zip Slip is a type of directory traversal vulnerability discovered by the Snyk security team and publicly disclosed on June 5, 2018. It can occur when a specially crafted archive file is extracted. In Snyk‚Äôs own words:

> Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving¬†**remote command execution**¬†on the victim‚Äôs machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.
>
> <https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability>

I‚Äôve omitted the vulnerable ZIP extraction code for the sake of brevity, but you can find the affected version here: <https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/flightcrew/blob/0.9.2/src/zipios/src/zipextraction.cpp>.

To confirm my suspicion, I downloaded the [Zip Slip sample archive](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability/blob/master/archives/zip-slip.zip) and passed it to the FlightCrew CLI.

![](https://i0.wp.com/salvatoresecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/zip_slip.png?resize=700%2C248&ssl=1)

The newly created `/tmp/evil.txt` file confirms that FlightCrew is, indeed, vulnerable to Zip Slip.

## Security Impact

In order to exploit this vulnerability, a local user must open a maliciously crafted EPUB file. That EPUB file can overwrite the user‚Äôs configuration files or other files, which might grant the attacker remote access or cause malicious code to be executed. This attack does not allow for privilege escalation and is, therefore, limited by the permissions and capabilities of the user.

## Remediation

As of July 15, 2019, Ubuntu users have access to a patched version of FlightCrew 0.7.2. Other FlightCrew users can apply the following patches and rebuild:

* <https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/flightcrew/commit/93175896ab7cc31266df0903490362ba37404676>
* <https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/flightcrew/commit/2e0286e78a117553af833b034aa08a2e919d08a5>
* <https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/flightcrew/commit/220a581ff8dd2045b4355f380898fbc34855d5d7>

## Disclosure Timeline

While analyzing [CVE-2019-13453](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13453), a Zip Slip vulnerability in FlightCrew is discovered.

Upstream developers are notified via a secure channel. A CRD of July 22, 2019 is proposed.

Upstream developers respond, requesting that the issue be made public on GitHub.

Upstream developers patch the vulnerability.

MITRE assigns [CVE-2019-13241](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13241) to this vulnerability.

## Summary & Lessons Learned

Of the three vulnerabilities discussed in this series, this was the most exciting and impactful vulnerability that I found. Whereas AFL did most of the work in finding the previous two vulnerabilities, I discovered this third one through an analysis of the code. While the previous two vulnerabilities allow for denial of service attacks, this one may allow for remote code execution.

Overall, my first foray into vulnerability research was a fun, challenging, and rewarding experience. Here are a few key takeaways:

#### Code used for validation should make no assumptions.

The sole purpose of code that performs validation is to accept and safely process malformed input. Any assumption that the input will conform to any expectation, no matter how small, can lead to a bug or security vulnerability. When reviewing code that performs validation, be on the lookout for any assumptions.

#### Fuzz your applications prior to each release.

Fuzzers should not be just a tool for security research; they should be used during software development and testing to find bugs *before* software is released. If you employ automated testing or continuous integration, adding a fuzzer to your pipeline is a great way to enforce this policy.

#### Fuzzing an application can be a shortcut to fuzzing a library.

Not all software is easy to fuzz. For example, libraries are not programs that you run, but programs that are used by other programs. One way to fuzz a library is to write a small piece of code called a ‚Äúharness‚Äù that accepts input and calls the library‚Äôs functions. If you find an application that utilizes the library, fuzzing it can be quicker than writing a harness.

# Fun with Fuzzers: How I Discovered Three Vulnerabilities (Part 2 of 3)

This is the second in a three-part series that chronicles how I discovered three vulnerabilities over the course of a day. If you haven‚Äôt already, you can go back and read the [first installment](https://salvatoresecurity.com/fun-with-fuzzers-or-how-i-discovered-three-vulnerabilities-part-1-of-3/).

## Introduction

I was surprised when [american fuzzy lop (AFL)](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) quickly found the [first vulnerability](https://salvatoresecurity.com/fun-with-fuzzers-or-how-i-discovered-three-vulnerabilities-part-1-of-3/) in [FlightCrew](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/flightcrew), so you can imagine my elation when it turned up the second in under two hours.

AFL status

## Vulnerability Analysis

Upon examining the backtrace, it quickly became apparent that the issue was not in FlightCrew itself, but within [Zipios](http://zipios.sourceforge.net/), a third-party library for handling ZIP files. FlightCrew includes a copy of the complete source code from Zipios v0.1.5.9.

In order to understand the root cause of this bug, a brief explanation of the ZIP archive structure is in order. ZIP archives consist of local file headers, file data, and the central directory. Additional metadata is also present but is not pertinent to this discussion.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/ZIP-64_Internal_Layout.svg/800px-ZIP-64_Internal_Layout.svg.png)

[ZIP File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29)

For each file within the ZIP archive, the central directory contains a ‚Äúcentral directory header.‚Äù The last field of a central directory header is an ‚Äúoffset‚Äù that points to the position of the file‚Äôs ‚Äúlocal header.‚Äù Together, the central directory and local file headers contain the information necessary to extract file data from the ZIP archive.

![](https://i0.wp.com/users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip-images/central-file-header.png?w=700&ssl=1)

[Central Directory Header](https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html)

In the fuzzed ZIP file, the ‚ÄúOffset of local header‚Äù field has been changed so that its value is larger than the size of the archive. We can see by examining the code that this leads to an infinite loop.

The central directory is read by the function `ZipFile::readCentralDirectory()`, which reads each central directory header. It then calls `ZipFile::confirmLocalHeaders()`.

#### src/zipios/src/zipfile.cpp

```
bool ZipFile::confirmLocalHeaders( istream &_zipfile ) {
  Entries::const_iterator it ;
  ZipCDirEntry *ent ;
  int inconsistencies = 0 ;
  ZipLocalEntry zlh ;
  for ( it = _entries.begin() ; it != _entries.end() ; it++ ) {
    ent = static_cast< ZipCDirEntry * >( (*it).get()  ) ;
    _vs.vseekg( _zipfile, ent->getLocalHeaderOffset(), ios::beg ) ;
    _zipfile >> zlh ;
    if ( ! _zipfile || zlh != *ent ) {
      inconsistencies++ ;
      _zipfile.clear() ;
    }
  }
  return ! inconsistencies ;
}

```

The call to `ent->getLocalHeaderoffset()` returns the unchecked local header offset value. Because the local header offset is greater than the size of the file, the call to `vseekg()` on line 180 seeks to the end of the file, setting the eofbit error state flag for `_zipfile`. An overloaded `>>` operator is then called on line 181.

#### src/zipios/src/ziphead.cpp

```
std::istream& operator>> ( std::istream &is, ZipCDirEntry &zcdh ) {
  zcdh._valid = false ; // set to true upon successful completion.
  if ( ! is )
    return is ;

  if ( zcdh.signature != readUint32( is ) ) {
    // put stream in error state and return
    is.setstate ( std::ios::failbit ) ;
    return is ;
  }
```
#### src/zipios/zipios++/zipheadio.h

```
inline uint32 readUint32 ( istream &is ) {
  static const int buf_len = sizeof ( uint32 ) ;
  unsigned char buf [ buf_len ] ;
  int rsf = 0 ;
  while ( rsf < buf_len ) {
    is.read ( reinterpret_cast< char * >( buf ) + rsf, buf_len - rsf ) ;
    rsf += static_cast< int >( is.gcount () ) ;
  }
  return  ztohl ( buf ) ;
}

```

Because the previous call to `vgseek()` caused `is` to seek to the end of the file, the call to `is.read()` on line 83 of zipheadio.h fails. Since `is` is at the end of the file, there are no more bytes to read. The call to `is.gcount()` returns 0, and line 84 is, therefore, logically equivalent to `rsf = rsf + 0`. As neither `rsf` nor `is` ever changes, the while loop‚Äôs condition on line 82 will never be true, resulting in an infinite loop.

## Security Impact

Users of the Zipios library (v0.1.5.9 and earlier) are vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. As this DoS is caused by an infinite loop, exploitation of this vulnerability can also lead to [uncontrolled resource consumption](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).

The latest version of Zipios (v2.2.1.0) is not vulnerable. Other versions of Zipios have not been analyzed.

## Remediation

This issue is resolved in [v0.1.7](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zipios/files/zipios%2B%2B/0.1.7/) of Zipios. It is recommended that Zipios users upgrade to [v0.1.7](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zipios/files/zipios%2B%2B/0.1.7/) or [v2.2.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zipios/files/zipios%2B%2B/2.2.0/) if possible.

As of July 15, 2019, Ubuntu users have access to a patched version of Zipios v0.1.5.9, as well as a patched version of FlightCrew.

Other Zipios and FlightCrew users can apply the following patch and rebuild: <https://sourceforge.net/p/zipios/code-git/ci/96e26640573410709bb863b8916a8216f4c6a546/tree/infinite_loop.patch>

## Disclosure Timeline

American fuzzy lop discovers that FlightCrew hangs when provided with certain malformed input due to a bug in the Zipios library.

Zipios upstream developers are notified via a secure channel. Upstream developers respond, stating that there is no support for v0.1.5.9 of the Zipios.

A patch is developed by Mike Salvatore and submitted to the upstream developers for review.

The [patch](https://sourceforge.net/p/zipios/code-git/ci/96e26640573410709bb863b8916a8216f4c6a546/tree/infinite_loop.patch) is modified by [Alexis Wilke](https://www.m2osw.com/) and accepted upstream.

[CVE-2019-13453](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13453) is assigned to this vulnerability by MITRE.

## The structure of a PKZip file

by Florian Buchholz

[General structure](#general)  [Local file headers](#localheader)  [Data descriptor](#datadescriptor)  [Archive decryption header](#archivedecrypt)  [Archive extra data record](#archivedata)  [Central directory](#centraldirectory)

[Printable Version](pkzip-printable.html)

### Overview

This document describes the on-disk structure of a PKZip (Zip) file. The documentation currently only describes the file layout format and meta information but does not address the actual compression or encryption of the file data itself. This documentation also does not discuss Zip archives that span multiple files in great detail. This documentation was created using the [official documentation](http://www.pkware.com/business_and_developers/developer/appnote/) provided by [PKWare Inc.](http://www.pkware.com/)

### General structure

Each Zip file is structured in the following manner:

![general layout of a zip file](pkzip-images/general-layout.png)

The archive consists of a series of local file descriptors, each containing a local file header, the actual compressed and/or encrypted data, as well as an optional data descriptor. Whether a data descriptor exists or not depends on a flag in the local file header.

Following the file descriptors is the archive decryption header, which only exists in PKZip file version 6.2 or greater. This header is only present if the central directory is encrypted and contains information about the encryption specification. The archive extra data record is also only for file of version 6.2 or greater and is not present in all Zip files. It is used in to support the encryption or compression of the central directory.

The central directory summarizes the local file descriptors and carries additional information regarding file attributes, file comments, location of the local headers, and multi-file archive information.

### Local file headers

Each local file header has the following structure:

![structure of a local file header](pkzip-images/local-file-header.png)

| Signature | The signature of the local file header. This is always '\x50\x4b\x03\x04'. |
| --- | --- |
| Version | PKZip version needed to extract |
| Flags | General purpose bit flag: Bit 00: encrypted file Bit 01: compression option  Bit 02: compression option  Bit 03: data descriptor Bit 04: enhanced deflation Bit 05: compressed patched data Bit 06: strong encryption Bit 07-10: unused Bit 11: language encoding Bit 12: reserved Bit 13: mask header values Bit 14-15: reserved |
| Compression method | 00: no compression 01: shrunk 02: reduced with compression factor 1 03: reduced with compression factor 2  04: reduced with compression factor 3  05: reduced with compression factor 4  06: imploded 07: reserved 08: deflated 09: enhanced deflated 10: PKWare DCL imploded 11: reserved 12: compressed using BZIP2 13: reserved 14: LZMA 15-17: reserved 18: compressed using IBM TERSE 19: IBM LZ77 z 98: PPMd version I, Rev 1 |
| File modification time | stored in standard MS-DOS format: Bits 00-04: seconds divided by 2  Bits 05-10: minute Bits 11-15: hour |
| File modification date | stored in standard MS-DOS format: Bits 00-04: day Bits 05-08: month Bits 09-15: years from 1980 |
| Crc-32 checksum | value computed over file data by CRC-32 algorithm with 'magic number' 0xdebb20e3 (little endian) |
| Compressed size | if archive is in ZIP64 format, this filed is 0xffffffff and the length is stored in the extra field |
| Uncompressed size | if archive is in ZIP64 format, this filed is 0xffffffff and the length is stored in the extra field |
| File name length | the length of the file name field below |
| Extra field length | the length of the extra field below |
| File name | the name of the file including an optional relative path. All slashes in the path should be forward slashes '/'. |
| Extra field | Used to store additional information. The field consistes of a sequence of header and data pairs, where the header has a 2 byte identifier and a 2 byte data size field. |

#### Example

Our sample zip file starts with a local file header:

```
00000000  50 4b 03 04 14 00 00 00  08 00 1c 7d 4b 35 a6 e1  |PK.........}K5..|
00000010  90 7d 45 00 00 00 4a 00  00 00 05 00 15 00 66 69  |.}E...J.......fi|
00000020  6c 65 31 55 54 09 00 03  c7 48 2d 45 c7 48 2d 45  |le1UT....H-E.H-E|
00000030  55 78 04 00 f5 01 f5 01  0b c9 c8 2c 56 00 a2 92  |Ux.........,V...|
```

This results in the following fields and field values:

![Example: first local file header](pkzip-images/ex-local-header.png)

| Signature | '\x50\x4b\x03\x04'. |
| --- | --- |
| Version | 0x14 = 20 -> 2.0 |
| Flags | no flags |
| Compression method | 08: deflated |
| File modification time | 0x7d1c = 0111110100011100  hour = (01111)10100011100 = 15  minute = 01111(101000)11100 = 40 second = 01111101000(11100) = 28 = 56 seconds  15:40:56 |
| File modification date | 0x354b = 0011010101001011 year = (0011010)101001011 = 26 month = 0011010(1010)01011 = 10 day = 00110101010(01011) = 11  10/11/2006 |
| Crc-32 checksum | 0x7d90e1a6 |
| Compressed size | 0x45 = 69 bytes |
| Uncompressed size | 0x4a = 74 bytes |
| File name length | 5 bytes |
| Extra field length | 21 bytes |
| File name | "file1" |
| Extra field | id 0x5455: extended timestamp, size: 9 bytes  Id 0x7855: Info-ZIP UNIX, size: 4 bytes |

### Data descriptor

The data descriptor is only present if bit 3 of the bit flag field is set. In this case, the CRC-32, compressed size, and uncompressed size fields in the local header are set to zero. The data descriptor field is byte aligned and immediately follows the file data. The structure is as follows:

![Structure of the data descriptor](pkzip-images/data-descriptor.png)

The example file does not contain a data descriptor.

### Archive decryption header

This header is used to support the Central Directory Encryption Feature. It is present when the central directory is encrypted. The format of this data record is identical to the Decryption header record preceding compressed file data.

### Archive extra data record

This header is used to support the Central Directory Encryption Feature. When present, this record immediately precedes the central directory data structure. The size of this data record will be included in the Size of the Central Directory field in the End of Central Directory record. The structure is as follows:

![Structure of the archive extra data record](pkzip-images/archive-extra-data-record.png)

### Central directory

The central directory contains more metadata about the files in the archive and also contains encryption information and information about Zip64 (64-bit zip archives) archives. Furthermore, the central directory contains information about archives that span multiple files. The structure of the central directory is as follows:

![Structure of the central directory](pkzip-images/central-directory-structure.png)

The file headers are similar to the local file headers, but contain some extra information. The Zip64 entries handle the case of a 64-bit Zip archive, and the end of the central directory record contains information about the archive itself.

### Central directory file header

The structure of the file header in the central directory is as follows:

![Structure of a file header](pkzip-images/central-file-header.png)

| Extra field | Used to store additional information. The field consistes of a sequence of header and data pairs, where the header has a 2 byte identifier and a 2 byte data size field. |
| File comment | An optional comment for the file. |

#### Example:

The corresponding file header from our local file header example above starts at byte 0x9a2 in the example file:

```
