Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-13594:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability was introduced due to customizations in Django middleware in Saleor version 2.7.0.
- These customizations were made to disable unnecessary elements for requests to the GraphQL API.
- However, this inadvertently disabled CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for all POST requests to static Django views in Storefront 1.0 and Dashboard 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing CSRF Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection on POST requests to static Django views.
- **Middleware Misconfiguration:** The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration of the Django middleware, where customizations to improve GraphQL API requests unintentionally disabled a critical security mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **CSRF Attacks:** An attacker could send a request without a valid CSRF token, and the server would accept it.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** This could potentially lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of a victim user, if the attacker could induce the victim's browser to submit a malicious POST request, for example via a malicious link or website.
- **Data Manipulation/Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify data by crafting malicious POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Websites:** An attacker could host a website containing malicious HTML/JavaScript to send POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Malicious Links/Emails:** An attacker could send a victim a link to a malicious site, or a link that directly submits a POST request to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **External Access:** An attacker does not need access to the internal network, and can launch attacks from the Internet.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** An attacker needs to craft HTTP POST requests that can bypass the CSRF token check.
- **Social Engineering:** To be successful, attackers typically need to lure users into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site which triggers an attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Saleor version 2.7.0.
- The fix involved reverting to the original middleware configuration, indicating that the performance gain from the customization was not worth the security risk.
- The fix was released in Saleor version 2.8.0.
- Users of Saleor version 2.7.0 were encouraged to upgrade immediately.
