Welcome to the June 2019 release of Saleor! Read on to learn about the newest changes!

### Avalara Integration

Saleor has, to date, only supported tax calculations for the EU with Vatlayer. To support taxes in other countries, we're integrating the popular Avalara tool with Saleor in this release! With Avalara enabled and configured, you'll get proper tax calculations during the checkout process. Your orders will also be accessible in the Avalara admin panel.

### Storing Credit Cards

We've improved the internal payment gateway interface, which now allows for storage and reuse of customers' payment sources, such as credit cards, if the gateway supports it. Additionally, we've implemented support in the Braintree gateway module and plan to add Stripe very soon.

### Improved Vouchers Section

Good user experience is always one of our top priorities. We are constantly testing Saleor and decided that the Vouchers section was quite challenging to use, so we set about designing an interface that would make it easier for you to quickly create attractive sales offers for your customers. We have now gathered common settings into visual cards, which makes for a clean and intuitive UI.

### CSRF Vulnerability Fix

This release fixes a security issue that was introduced in version 2.7.0. In that release, we made customizations to the Django middleware in order to disable some elements that were unnecessary for requests coming to the GraphQL API. Unfortunately, we inadvertently disabled CSRF protection for all POST requests coming to static Django views in Storefront 1.0 and Dashboard 1.0. An attacker could therefore send a request without the valid CSRF token, and the server would accept it. In this release, to close this loophole, we've reverted to the original middleware configuration. We felt that the performance gain was minimal and it wasn't a crucial feature for the system, so the original solution is acceptable.

The issue was introduced on 16 May, 2019: [94c0703](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/commit/94c07034ff1bfc209461e39ca1bb6228d8ca0e35)

Affected versions: 2.7.0

All users of the affected version are encouraged to upgrade Saleor immediately.

### @korycins **[korycins](/korycins)** commented [Jun 18, 2019](#issue-457470835) • edited Loading

This PR introduces a new structure for taxes. All tax's logic is moved to separate module and Saleor is "communicating" with custom tax modules (Avalara/Vatlayer) by a given interface. All internal operations in Saleor are on Money field, taxes should be applied when the TaxedPrice will be returned to the final user.

Some logic still operates on vatlayer's taxes object. It is required to reduce the number of hits to Redis/DB. We will remove it when we transfer taxes object to the plugin (after we introduce plugin architecture).

This is only the backend part. Some fronted work will be needed.

Same thing for documentation. It will be added in separate PR.

It closes [#3539](https://github.com/saleor/saleor/issues/3539)

Maybe I missed something, but there is any particular reason why you didn't use official Avalara Python SDK? (<https://pypi.org/project/Avalara/>)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@Kwaidan00](https://github.com/Kwaidan00) The answer is very simple. One month and one week ago they were proposing python library supported by the external GH user (They still have it when you download the documentation as a pdf). [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23282005/60429997-95467f80-9bfc-11e9-9486-9319d6fc47e8.png)  After I discovered their library I went through their source code. The library doesn't give you anything more than methods with `requests.post` calls. All data preparation is on our side. |
