Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-13360

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the login process of the CWP (Control Web Panel) user panel. It allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism by manipulating the response to a login request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is a logic flaw that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user account by crafting a specific string and injecting it into the response.
- **Insufficient Response Validation:** The system fails to properly validate the login response, allowing the injected string to redirect the user to the target account without proper authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** A remote attacker, with knowledge of a valid username, can bypass the login process and gain complete access to the targeted user's account.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This grants the attacker the ability to manage the compromised account's settings, data, and potentially perform other actions on the server within the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack is performed remotely by intercepting and manipulating HTTP requests/responses.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker would need to intercept the communication between the user and the server to manipulate the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Valid Username:** The attacker needs to know a valid username on the system.
- **Network Interception:** Ability to intercept the HTTP request/response.
- **Response Manipulation:** Capability to modify the HTTP response to include the crafted bypass string.
- **No need for valid credentials:** The attacker does not need a valid password.

**Technical Details:**
The bypass is achieved by:
1. Sending a login request with a valid username but an invalid password.
2. Intercepting the login request.
3. Releasing the intercepted request to the server.
4. Intercepting the server's response.
5. Creating a bypass string in the format `username||/username/theme/original`.
6. Base64 encoding the bypass string.
7. Replacing the original response with the base64 encoded bypass string.
8. Releasing the modified response to the browser.
9. This results in the attacker being logged into the user account associated with the provided username.
