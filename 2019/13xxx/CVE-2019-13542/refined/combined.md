As part of a security strategy, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:

* Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside.
* Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks.
* Use VPN (virtual private networks) tunnels if remote access is required.
* Activate and apply user management and password features.
* Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
* Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions. For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the CODESYS security whitepaper at <https://customers.codesys.com/fileadmin/data/customers/security/CODESYS-Security-Whitepaper.pdf>
