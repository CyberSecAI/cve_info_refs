Vulnerability: CVE-2019-13927
Title: Desigo PX Web Remote Denial of Service Vulnerability

Summary:
A vulnerability in Desigo PXC devices could allow unauthenticated remote users to cause a denial of service condition on the PX Web interface (HTTP, port tcp/80) of a device.

Affected Products:
- Desigo PX automation controllers PXC00-E.D, PXC50-E.D, PXC100-E.D, PXC200-E.D with Desigo PX Web modules PXA40-W0, PXA40-W1, PXA40-W2: All firmware versions < V6.00.320
- Desigo PX automation controllers PXC00-U, PXC64-U, PXC128-U with Desigo PX Web modules PXA30-W0, PXA30-W1, PXA30-W2: All firmware versions < V6.00.320
- Desigo PX automation controllers PXC22.1-E.D, PXC36-E.D, PXC36.1-E.D with activated web server: All firmware versions < V6.00.320

Root Cause:
The device contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service condition on the device’s web server by sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the web server port (tcp/80).

Attack vector:
An attacker with network access to an affected device can send a specially crafted HTTP message to the web server port (tcp/80).

Impact:
Successful exploitation compromises the availability of the device’s web service. The web server responds with HTTP status code 404 (Not found) to any further request. The device itself stays operational, but a reboot is required to recover the web interface.

Attacker Capabilities:
- Network access to the affected device is required.
- No system privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.

Weakness:
CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter

Mitigation:
Install V6.00.320 or a later version. Ensure that the PX Web interface is only accessible from trusted networks. Protect network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms.
