VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13927

The device contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service condition
on the device’s web server by sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the web server port
(tcp/80).

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to an affected device.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise the availability of the device’s web service. While the device itself
stays operational, the web server responds with HTTP status code 404 (Not found) to any further
request. A reboot is required to recover the web interface.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
