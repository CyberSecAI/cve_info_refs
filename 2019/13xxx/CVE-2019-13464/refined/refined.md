The provided content is related to CVE-2019-13464.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ModSecurity rule `933110` was designed to detect PHP script file uploads by inspecting the `X-Filename`, `X_Filename`, and `X-File-Name` headers for patterns like `*.php`, `*.php*`, or `*.phtml`. However, PHP transforms dots in header names to underscores, which means a header like `X.Filename` will be interpreted by the application as `X_Filename`. This inconsistency in how header names are interpreted allows for a bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a false negative in the ModSecurity rule. The rule only checks for `X-Filename`, `X_Filename`, and `X-File-Name`, but it does not account for the PHP behavior of converting dots to underscores in header names. This allows an attacker to evade detection by sending a request with a header like `X.Filename`, which will still be interpreted as `X_Filename` by the server-side PHP application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is the ability to upload malicious PHP scripts while bypassing the security rule designed to prevent it. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, data breaches, or other forms of compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is an HTTP request with a crafted header name (e.g., `X.Filename`) containing a malicious PHP file extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server and manipulate the request headers. The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the server.
