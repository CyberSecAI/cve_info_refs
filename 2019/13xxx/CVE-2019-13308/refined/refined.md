Here's a breakdown of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2019-13308:

**1. CVE-2019-13308 Description (from SUSE and MITRE):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow located in the `MagickCore/fourier.c` file within the `ComplexImage` function. The vulnerability occurs due to mishandling of rows.
*   **Weaknesses:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **NVD:**  Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **SUSE:** Lower impact, with partial impacts to integrity and availability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **NVD:** Network
    *   **SUSE:** Local
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** 
    *   **NVD:** None required. User interaction required to exploit
    *   **SUSE:** None required. User interaction required to exploit

**2.  SUSE Information:**

*   SUSE rates this as a moderate severity issue.
*   Provides CVSS v2 and v3 scores with different attack vector/impact. SUSE CVSSv3 score is much lower
*   Lists affected SUSE products, fixed package versions, patch names, and bugzilla entries
*   States that the issue is resolved.

**3. Debian Information:**

*   A Debian security advisory (DSA-4712-1) mentions CVE-2019-13308 as one of several vulnerabilities fixed in the `imagemagick` package update.
*   The advisory states that various memory handling issues could lead to denial of service, information disclosure or potentially arbitrary code execution, similar to the NVD assessment.

**4. GitHub Information (Issue #1595):**

*   A GitHub issue report (#1595) describes a heap-buffer-overflow in `MagickCore/fourier.c:299:18 in ComplexImage`. 
*   The report provides specific commands to reproduce the issue, along with an ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output demonstrating the heap buffer overflow.
*  The ASAN output shows the exact line in `fourier.c` that's causing the issue, confirming the SUSE description.
*   The reporter noted they compiled the ImageMagick with the `--disable-openmp` option.

**5. GitHub Commit Information:**

*   A commit (19651f3db63fa1511ed83a348c4c82fa553f8d01) is linked to the same issue (#1595), suggesting a fix related to the vulnerability.
*   The commit modifies the `fourier.c` file, indicating changes to the `ComplexImages` function where the heap-based buffer overflow exists.
    *   Changes include modification of how PixelPackets are handled, along with an if statement to handle the `images->matte`

**6. openSUSE Mailing List:**

*   An openSUSE security update (openSUSE-SU-2019:1983-1) includes CVE-2019-13308 as one of the resolved issues.
*   The mailing list provides a summary of all the fixes in ImageMagick and provides patch instructions

**7. Ubuntu Security Notice:**

*   Ubuntu security notice (USN-4192-1) lists CVE-2019-13308 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the `imagemagick` package update.
*   The advisory indicates the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in `MagickCore/fourier.c` within the `ComplexImage` function.
*   **Root Cause:** Mishandling of rows and memory in the ComplexImage function.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network and Local
*   **Attacker Capability**: None required. User interaction required to exploit
*   **Affected Software:** ImageMagick (specifically versions around 7.0.8-50 Q16).
*   **Mitigation:** Apply the provided patches/updates for the respective OS distributions.
*   The various reports consistently point to a vulnerability in the `ComplexImage` function with the `fourier.c` file, and include very similar descriptions and impacts.
*   The GitHub commit provides more details of the code changes.

The information from the different sources aligns on the core issue but varies slightly on the severity and attack vectors, where the SUSE reports are generally less severe in their assessments. The GitHub issue and commit provide valuable technical insights into the cause of the vulnerability and the nature of the fix.
