Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13108:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `PngImage::readMetadata()` function within the Exiv2 library. Specifically, when processing PNG image files, if the `chunkLength` is zero, it leads to `iccOffset` also being zero. Subsequent operations using `iccOffset` cause a division by zero or a memory access violation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow/Zero Value Handling:** The core issue is that the code doesn't properly handle a zero value for `chunkLength`, resulting in a zero value for `iccOffset`.
- **SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault):**  The integer overflow/zero value leads to an attempt to access an invalid memory location when `iccOffset` is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a crash (SIGSEGV) of the application using the Exiv2 library. This can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted PNG Image:** The attack vector involves an attacker crafting a malicious PNG image file specifically designed to trigger the integer overflow in the `PngImage::readMetadata()` function by setting `chunkLength` to zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PNG image to an application that utilizes the vulnerable version of the Exiv2 library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Exiv2 versions 0.27.1 (commit `88f22e13cb1917ac94a95f95f74c9ee93c5472c8`) and also present in the master branch (commit `9a38066b8eddf3948696a3362aac29e012ebe690`).
- The fix was implemented in commit `8cd95e221889e41e9cc153e2cfb5a7b41c7bc7a4`, which was included in the 0.27.2 release.
- The Red Hat bug report indicates that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 were not affected as they didn't include the vulnerable code.
- A fix was included in Fedora 30 update (exiv2-0.27.2-1.fc30).
