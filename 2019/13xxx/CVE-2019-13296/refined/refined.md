  "CVE-2019-13296": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has direct memory leaks in AcquireMagickMemory because of an error in CLIListOperatorImages in MagickWand/operation.c for a NULL value.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs due to an error in the `CLIListOperatorImages` function within the `MagickWand/operation.c` file, where a NULL value is not properly handled leading to memory leaks in `AcquireMagickMemory`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Direct memory leaks due to improper handling of NULL values.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Memory leak leading to potential resource exhaustion and denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered through a crafted image processing operation that results in a NULL value being processed by CLIListOperatorImages.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted input to ImageMagick that will trigger the vulnerable code path."
  },
  "CVE-2019-13297": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has a heap-based buffer over-read at MagickCore/threshold.c in AdaptiveThresholdImage because a height of zero is mishandled.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a mishandling of a zero height value within the `AdaptiveThresholdImage` function in `MagickCore/threshold.c` leading to a heap-based buffer over-read.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer over-read.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Potential for information disclosure and possibly arbitrary code execution due to the buffer over-read.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing an image with a height of zero to the `AdaptiveThresholdImage` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted image that will be processed by ImageMagick."
  },
    "CVE-2019-13298": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has a heap-based buffer overflow at MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h in SetPixelViaPixelInfo because of a MagickCore/enhance.c error.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is triggered by an error in `MagickCore/enhance.c` which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow within `SetPixelViaPixelInfo` located in `MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Potential for arbitrary code execution and denial of service due to the buffer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specifically crafted image that causes an error in the `MagickCore/enhance.c` code, resulting in the buffer overflow in `SetPixelViaPixelInfo`.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted image to ImageMagick which triggers the vulnerable code."
  },
   "CVE-2019-13299": {
    "Description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-50 Q16 has a heap-based buffer over-read at MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h in GetPixelChannel.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is a heap-based buffer over-read within the `GetPixelChannel` function located in `MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer over-read.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability could lead to information disclosure or a denial of service due to a buffer over-read.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a crafted image that results in an out-of-bounds read in the GetPixelChannel function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide a specific crafted image to ImageMagick that triggers the vulnerability."
