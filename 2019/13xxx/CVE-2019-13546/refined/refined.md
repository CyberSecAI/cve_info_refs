- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability within the IntelliSpace Perinatal application allows an attacker to break out of the application's containment and access unauthorized resources on the Windows operating system as a limited-access Windows user. This breakout can occur through physical access to a locked application screen or an authorized remote desktop session.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of resource to wrong sphere (CWE-668). The application fails to properly restrict access to operating system resources, allowing a low-privileged user to potentially access unauthorized data and functions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow unauthorized access to system resources, including the ability to execute software or view/update files, directories, or system configurations. This impacts the confidentiality and integrity of the system. If the Document Export (DOX) function is enabled, protected health information (PHI) could also be at risk. Additionally, exploitation could potentially lead to privilege escalation on the operating system due to underlying Windows vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to a locked application screen or through an authorized remote desktop session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Low skill level required for exploitation.
  - The attacker needs either physical access to the system or must have an authorized remote desktop session.
  - The attacker gains access as a limited access Windows user.
