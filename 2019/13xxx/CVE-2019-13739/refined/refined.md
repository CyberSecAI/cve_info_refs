Here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2019-13739 from the provided texts:

**Title:** Incorrect security UI in Omnibox

**CVE Description:** Insufficient policy enforcement in Omnibox in Google Chrome prior to 79.0.3945.79 allowed a remote attacker to perform domain spoofing via IDN homographs via a crafted domain name.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient policy enforcement in the Omnibox component.

**Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the Omnibox, which is the address bar in Chrome. The insufficient policy enforcement makes it possible to spoof the displayed domain name.

**Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting a specific domain name.  The SUSE description specifies the use of IDN homographs, which are domain names that use characters from different scripts that look similar to Latin characters (e.g., using a Cyrillic "a" instead of a Latin "a").

**Impact:** A successful attack allows a remote attacker to perform domain spoofing, potentially tricking users into thinking they are visiting a legitimate website when they are not. This can lead to phishing attacks or other forms of deception.

**Affected Component:** Omnibox in Google Chrome

**Affected Versions:** Google Chrome versions prior to 79.0.3945.79.

**Mitigation:** Upgrade to version 79.0.3945.79 or later.
