- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The server does not validate the `Origin` header during a WebSocket handshake. According to RFC6455, the server should check the `Origin` header to determine if it should accept the incoming connection. If the server doesn't validate the origin, it will accept connections from anywhere, thus making it vulnerable to WebSocket hijacking.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing origin validation in WebSocket handshake.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious client from a different origin can establish a websocket connection, potentially gaining unauthorized access or performing actions they should not be able to perform.
- **Attack vectors**: Establishing a websocket connection from a malicious origin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to be able to send a malicious websocket handshake request to the vulnerable server.
