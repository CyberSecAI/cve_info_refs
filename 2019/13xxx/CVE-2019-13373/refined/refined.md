Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-13373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Unauthenticated SQL Command Injection:** The `/web/Public/Conn.php` script directly uses unsanitized POST parameters `dbAction` and `dbSQL` in a database query, allowing unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   The `/web/Lib/Action/PayAction.class.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `passcode` GET parameter, also without authentication

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The vulnerable scripts do not properly authenticate or authorize users before allowing access to database functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Data Access:** Attackers can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract any data from the database, including sensitive information such as usernames, passwords (in this case hashed), and other user information.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can add new administrator accounts, effectively granting themselves full control over the application
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Although not explicitly the focus of this CVE, the report notes the potential for RCE related to these vulnerabilities, as SQL injection may allow for modification of system commands and the ability to introduce malicious code to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers send crafted POST requests to `/web/Public/Conn.php` with malicious SQL commands in the `dbSQL` parameter.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers send crafted GET request to `/index.php/Pay/passcodeAuth` with malicious SQL commands in the `passcode` parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers must be able to reach the vulnerable application through the network, without the need to log in or authenticate.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints:** Attackers must be aware of the vulnerable filepaths in order to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities within the D-Link Central WiFi Manager software, including arbitrary SQL command injection (CVE-2019-13373), remote code execution (related to CVE-2019-13372 and CVE-2019-13374), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (not detailed in this CVE).
*   The content provides proof-of-concept (POC) code for exploiting the vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary SQL queries and add new administrators.
*   The vendor, D-Link, was notified, and a patch was eventually released to address the issues.
