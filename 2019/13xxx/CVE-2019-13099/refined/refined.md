The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Momo Android application (version 2.1.9). Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application logs sensitive user information, including passwords and access tokens, to the Android system log (logcat). This is likely due to improper logging practices within the application's code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure logging:** The application logs sensitive data to the system log, making it accessible to other applications with the necessary permissions.
- **Exposure of credentials:** User credentials, specifically the old and new PIN (which can be used as passwords), and access tokens are exposed in the logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to a user's credentials and access token.
- **Account Compromise:** With the exposed credentials, an attacker can potentially gain full control of the victim's Momo account, leading to unauthorized transactions, modification of account settings, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with access to the device (physical or through remote access tools) can use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to access the logcat output.
- **Malicious application:** A malicious application installed on the same device with the READ_LOGS permission can monitor the system logs and extract the sensitive information logged by the vulnerable Momo application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical or remote access to the device:** The attacker needs to be able to execute adb commands on the device or have a malicious application on the device that can read the logs.
- **Basic Android debugging knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with how to access and filter logcat output using the adb tool.
