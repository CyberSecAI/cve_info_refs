  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2019-13450",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Mac Zoom Client allows any malicious website to enable your camera without your permission. The flaw potentially exposes up to 750,000 companies around the world that use Zoom to conduct day-to-day business.",
    "root_cause": "The Zoom Mac client installs a local web server on port 19421 which is used to launch meetings via a custom URI. This web server does not enforce CORS, allowing any website to interact with it. The webserver also allows re-installation of the zoom client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of CORS enforcement in local web server",
      "Undocumented API of local webserver",
       "Local web server re-installs Zoom client without user interaction"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious website can force a user to join a Zoom call with their camera enabled. A website can also launch a DOS attack by repeatedly attempting to join a user to an invalid call. A malicious domain could be used to re-install the client, leading to remote code execution if the installer is compromised.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage or clicking on a malicious link",
      "Embedding an iframe with a zoom link in a website or a malicious ad"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a webpage with the exploit or send a link containing the exploit to a user with the Zoom client installed. No authentication is needed.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability leverages a feature that allows users to join meetings by simply clicking a link, which opens the local zoom client.  The local web server also allows for re-installation and updates of the client, a feature that persists even after the client has been uninstalled, and it's used to bypass Safari's security prompts. The local server responds with image dimensions that act as status codes to bypass CORS restrictions."
