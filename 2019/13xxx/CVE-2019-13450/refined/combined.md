# CVE-Numbers

* DOS Vulnerability — Fixed in Client version 4.4.2 — [CVE-2019–13449](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13449)
* Information Disclosure (Webcam) — Unfixed —[CVE-2019–13450](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13450)

# UPDATE — July 9th (am)

As far as I can tell this vulnerability also impacts Ringcentral. Ringcentral for their web conference system is a white labeled Zoom system.

# UPDATE — July 9th (pm)

According to Zoom, they will have a fix shipped by midnight tonight pacific time removing the hidden web server; hopefully this patches the most glaring parts of this vulnerability. The Zoom CEO has also assured us that they will be updating their application to further protect users privacy.

# UPDATE — July 15th

If you have updated Zoom to the latest version, you are now greeted with this new UI confirming you would actually like to join the meeting.

# UPDATE — July 17th

It has since [come to light that Zoom and 13 of their white label applications contained a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability](https://blog.assetnote.io/bug-bounty/2019/07/17/rce-on-zoom/). Zoom, RingCentral, Telus Meetings, BT Cloud Phone Meetings, Office Suite HD Meeting, AT&T Video Meetings, BizConf, Huihui, UMeeting, Zhumu, Zoom CN, EarthLink Meeting Room, Video Conferencia Telmex, & Accession Meeting. Apple has since silently removed these applications from your computer by utilizing MRT.

# Foreword

This vulnerability allows any website to forcibly join a user to a Zoom call, with their video camera activated, without the user's permission.

On top of this, this vulnerability would have allowed any webpage to DOS (Denial of Service) a Mac by repeatedly joining a user to an invalid call.

Additionally, if you’ve ever installed the Zoom client and then uninstalled it, you still have a `localhost` web server on your machine that will happily re-install the Zoom client for you, without requiring any user interaction on your behalf besides visiting a webpage. This re-install ‘feature’ continues to work to this day.

![]()

Yep, no joke.

This vulnerability leverages the amazingly simple Zoom feature where you can just send anyone a meeting link (for example `https://zoom.us/j/492468757`) and when they open that link in their browser their Zoom client is magically opened on their local machine. I was curious about how this amazing bit of functionality was implemented and how it had been implemented securely. Come to find out, it really hadn’t been implemented securely. Nor can I figure out a good way to do this that doesn’t require an additional bit of user interaction to be secure.

![]()

This vulnerability was originally responsibly disclosed on March 26, 2019. This initial report included a proposed description of a ‘quick fix’ Zoom could have implemented by simply changing their server logic. It took Zoom 10 days to confirm the vulnerability. The first actual meeting about how the vulnerability would be patched occurred on June 11th, 2019, only 18 days before the end of the 90-day public disclosure deadline. During this meeting, the details of the vulnerability were confirmed and Zoom’s planned solution was discussed. However, I was very easily able to spot and describe bypasses in their planned fix. At this point, Zoom was left with 18 days to resolve the vulnerability. On June 24th after 90 days of waiting, the last day before the public disclosure deadline, I discovered that Zoom had only implemented the ‘quick fix’ solution originally suggested.

Ultimately, Zoom failed at quickly confirming that the reported vulnerability actually existed and they failed at having a fix to the issue delivered to customers in a timely manner. An organization of this profile and with such a large user base should have been more proactive in protecting their users from attack.

# Details

On Mac, if you have ever installed Zoom, there is a web server on your local machine running on port `19421`. You can confirm this server is present by running `lsof -i :19421` in your terminal.

First off, let me start off by saying having an installed app that is running a web server on my local machine with a totally undocumented API feels incredibly sketchy to me. Secondly, the fact that any website that I visit can interact with this web server running on my machine is a huge red flag for me as a Security Researcher.

![]()

Here’s the code on the Zoom site that tipped me off to this localhost server.

My original thoughts when I learned that this web server existed was that if there is a buffer overflow anywhere in the parameter handling of this web server, someone could achieve RCE on my machine. That’s not what I’ve found, but that was my original thought process.

If you look at what’s logged to the web developer console when visiting one of those Zoom ‘join’ links, you should see something like this:

![]()

Browser console logs when visiting `<https://zoom.us/j/492468757>`

I also found that, instead of making a regular AJAX request, this page instead loads an image from the Zoom web server that is locally running. The different dimensions of the image dictate the error/status code of the server. You can see that case-switch logic here.

![]()

The two numbers are the pixel dimensions of the image returned by the web server.

The scary thing is that this enum seemed to indicate that this web server can do far more than just launch a Zoom meeting. What I found out was that this web server can also re-install the Zoom app if a user has uninstalled it, more on that later.

One question I asked is, why is this web server returning this data encoded in the dimensions of an image file? The reason is, it’s done to bypass [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). For very intentional reasons, the browser explicitly ignores any CORS policy for servers running on localhost.

> Chrome [does not support localhost for CORS requests](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67743) (an open bug since 2010).
> - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10883211/deadly-cors-when-http-localhost-is-the-origin>

I’m guessing that this is intentionally done for security reasons. Regardless, it seems that Zoom is abusing a hack to bypass CORS protection. More on that later.

## The Video Call Vulnerability

I created a personal meeting with a different account and cracked open [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and started to remove parameters to see what the minimal GET request was that was required to launch a Zoom meeting.

There are a lot of random parameters that are sent to the localhost web server but the only ones that seem to matter are the following.

* action=join
* confno=[whatever the conference number is]

Using the following GET request from Postman I was successfully able to get my computer to join the Zoom call that the other account had created.

Once I had this, I started tinkering with what other “action” parameters I might be able to pass to get the client to do other things. I wasn’t able to find anything even after searching through the various public documents and the public ProtoBuff schema for hints about what hidden functionality may exist. Again, this webserver’s API is completely undocumented as far as I can tell and I’ve spent several hours searching for any mention of this Desktop web server in the official and unofficial documentation.

So now I had a minimal POC that I could use to maliciously get any user into a call, however, the default setting for the “New Meeting” is to allow the user to choose whether to join their Audio/Video. **I would consider this alone a security vulnerability.**

> The above-described behavior continues to work to this day! You can still use this exploit to launch someone into a call without their permission.

I read about the [Tenable Remote Code Execution in Zoom security vulnerability](https://www.tenable.com/blog/tenable-research-advisory-zoom-unauthorized-command-execution-cve-2018-15715) which was only patched within the last 6 months. Had the Tenable vulnerability been combined with this vulnerability it would have allowed RCE against any computer with the Zoom Mac client installed. If a similar future vulnerability were to be found, it would allow any website on the internet to achieve RCE on the user’s machine.

I advised Zoom that if they have any users that are still using Zoom 4.1.33259.0925 versions or lower, this would be a very potent attack.

So far, I could only achieve getting a user into a call without their permission. Although this has hypothetical security implications, I didn’t have a true exploit. I started tinkering with figuring out how to get someone’s camera activated. When setting up a meeting for work I was greeted with this screen.

![]()

You can choose to enable a participant’s video camera when they join the call.

Enabling “Participants: On” when setting up a meeting, I discovered that anyone joining my meeting automatically had their video connected.

When I got back to my personal machine, I tried this same functionality and found that it worked exactly the same.

This prompted me to create the Proof Of Concept below.

**Proof Of Concept**

The local client Zoom web server is running as a background process, so to exploit this, a user doesn’t even need to be “running” (in the traditional sense) the Zoom app to be vulnerable.

One line, it’s really that simple.

Or if you want the video camera activated, just embed a Zoom join link in your site with an iframe.

All a website would need to do is embed the above in their website and any Zoom user will be instantly connected with their video running. **This is still true today!**

This could be embedded in malicious ads, or it could be used as a part of a phishing campaign. If I were actually an attacker, I’d probably invest some time to also include the incrementing port logic that the code in the Javascript running on Zoom’s site.

A fully working POC that you can test out yourself can be found at the link below. **Warning:** Clicking this link on Mac will launch you into a Zoom call!
<https://jlleitschuh.org/zoom_vulnerability_poc/>

A fully working POC that will launch you into a call **with your video camera** active can be found here. **Warning:** Clicking this link on Mac will launch you into a Zoom call with your camera activated!
<https://jlleitschuh.org/zoom_vulnerability_poc/zoompwn_iframe.html>

**Quick Fix**

To fix the “auto join with video” part of the vulnerability, I advised Zoom on their backend server they immediately disable a meeting creator’s ability to automatically enable a participants video by default. I advised that this was 100%, not a complete fix. However, it could serve as a quick way to protect users from the invasion of privacy component of this attack.

I also advised that if there is hidden functionality where a meeting host can forcibly join computer audio (perhaps something I’m not seeing because I don’t have a Pro account), this should also be disabled.

I commented that allowing a host to choose whether or not a participant will automatically join with video should be considered it’s own standalone security vulnerability.

To this advisement, I received the following response:

> Zoom believes in giving our customers the power to choose how they want to Zoom. This includes whether they want a seamless experience in joining a meeting with microphone and video automatically enabled, or if they want to manually enable these input devices after joining a meeting. Such configuration options are available in the Zoom Meeting client audio and video settings.
>
> However, we also recognize the desire by some customers to have a confirmation dialog before joining a meeting. Based on your recommendations and feature requests from other customers, the Zoomteam [sic] is evaluating options for such a feature, as well as additional account level controls over user input device settings. We will be sure to keep you informed of our plans in this regard.

![]()

When responding to responsible disclosure, don’t go into PR spin mode. It’s counterproductive.

It’s important to note that the default configuration for Zoom is to allow a host to choose whether or not your camera is enabled or not by default.

Zoom did end up patching this vulnerability, but all they did was prevent the attacker from turning on the user’s video camera. They did not disable the ability for an attacker to forcibly join to a call anyone visiting a malicious site.

UPDATE: July 7th, 2019: There has been a regression in the fix implemented by Zoom thus allowing this vulnerability to be exploited with the video camera activated.

## The Denial Of Service (DOS) Vulnerability

This same vulnerability also allowed the attacker to DOS any user’s machine. By simply sending repeated GET requests for a bad number, Zoom app would constantly request ‘focus’ from the OS. The following simple POC demonstrated this vulnerability.

Proof of concept for a DOS attack against any Zoom user on Mac

This DOS vulnerability was patched in version 4.4.2 of the Zoom client.

## The Install Vulnerability

If you have ever installed Zoom on your computer, this web server is installed. It continues to run if you uninstall Zoom from your computer.

This server also supports updating and installing a new version of Zoom in addition to launching a call. I did some additional decompilation of the Zoom web server to see the code path that these endpoints seemed to call.

Using Hopper Disassembler to disassemble the Objective-C bytecode of the web server I found the following method.

![]()

Takes arguments from some API request and uses it to craft a download URL used to upgrade the version of Zoom installed?

This method is gated by the following logic.

![]()

Ensures the download URL is only under ‘trusted’ subdomains.

One of the API’s inside of this web server running on all Macs with Zoom installed is an endpoint that allows the current version of Zoom that’s installed to be updated or re-installed by this server.

You can confirm that this logic does indeed exist by doing the following:

1. Install the Zoom client on your computer if you don’t already have it installed.
2. Open the Zoom client, then shut it down.
3. Uninstall the Zoom client from your computer by dragging the `Applications/zoom.us.app` file to the trash.
4. Open any Zoom join link and Zoom will ‘helpfully’ be re-installed for you in the `Applications` folder and will be launched by this web server.

Using the list of domains listed inside of the application that could be used to download updates for the Zoom app, I decided to check and see what each of the sites returned when visited. For example, here’s the result of visiting <https://zipow.com/upgrade?os=mac>

![]()

You can clearly see the URL to be used to download the zoom installer if Zoom needs to be re-installed.

Doing a `whois` lookup on all of the domains listed in the source code returned some interesting results. For example, the domain `zoomgov.com` was scheduled to expire on May 1st, 2019. Had this domain registration been allowed to lapse, the takeover of this domain would have allowed an attacker to host an infected version of the Zoom installer from this site and infected users who had uninstalled Zoom from their computers. Essentially, this would have made this vulnerability a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. I disclosed this bit of information to the Zoom team during my call with the Mozilla security team on April 26th, 2019. Within 5 hours of the end of that call that domain had been registered out to May 1st, 2024.

## Fundamental Security Vulnerability

In my opinion, websites should not be talking to Desktop applications like this. There is a fundamental sandbox that browsers are supposed to enforce to prevent malicious code from being executed on users machines.

Having every Zoom user have a web server that accepts HTTP GET requests that trigger code outside of the browser sandbox is painting a huge target on the back of Zoom. It’s important to note that if you try to pull off the same exploit directly with a Javascript AJAX request, you are greeted with the following exception.

![]()

All localhost request from Javascript are forbidden by browsers.

**CORS-RFC1918**

In discussing this vulnerability with both the Chromium and Mozilla Firefox security team they both said that they couldn’t do anything about this vulnerability. The Chromium team pointed me to [CORS-RFC1918](https://wicg.github.io/cors-rfc1918/) which is a proposal that will require browser vendors to query users for permission before allowing sites to make requests against local resources like `localhost` and the `192.168.1.*` address space.

Linked in that RFC is a wonderful and fun to read bug report where Tavis Ormandy of Google’s Project Zero found a similar vulnerability in TrendMicro’s Password Manager allowing remote code execution via the browser and the exfiltration of a user’s passwords from a password vault. [That story is well worth the read](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=693&redir=1).

When this same vulnerability was reported to the Mozilla Firefox team, they closed it as it wasn’t considered a vulnerability against Firefox. However, they soon reopened the report as a vulnerability against their internal infrastructure. As a result, I was invited into a call with the Zoom and Mozilla Firefox team to discuss the vulnerability on April 26th, 2019. During this call, they promised Mozilla and me that this vulnerability would be patched well before the end of the 90-day disclosure deadline. This turned out to be false.

# Zoom’s Proposed Fixes

The fix proposed by the Zoom team was to digitally ‘sign’ the request made to the client. However, this simply means that an attacker would have to have a backend server that makes requests to the Zoom site first to gain a valid signature before forwarding the signature on to the client.

They also proposed locking the signature to the IP that made the request. This would mean that as long as the attacker’s server was behind the same NAT router as the victim, the attack would still work.

I described to the Zoom team how both of these solutions were not enough to fully protect their users. Unfortunately, this left the Zoom team with only 18 days before public disclosure to come up with some better solution.

Unfortunately, even after my warning, this was the solution they chose to go with. This new signature or token is embedded in a new parameter called `confid`. The simplest way to bypass this new `confid` check was to simply use the `iframe` workaround described above. Alternatively, if you and the victim are behind the same NAT router, you can make a request for the join page, extract the `#lhs_launch_parames` field from the HTML document and embed it in the HTML response from the malicious page.

# Conclusion

As of 2015 [Zoom had over 40 million users](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/02/04/1130354/0/en/Zoom-Raises-30M-in-Series-C-Funding-Led-by-Emergence-Capital.html). Given that Macs are 10% of the PC market and Zoom has had significant growth since 2015 we can assume that at least 4 million of Zoom’s users are on Mac. Tools like Zoom, Google Meet or Skype for Business is a staple of today's modern office.

Any vulnerability in an application with this many users must be considered a serious threat to all those users. All of the vulnerabilities described in this report can be exploited via [“drive-by attack” methodologies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/). Many times during my conversation with the Zoom security team they seemed to argue that the seriousness of this vulnerability was limited because it would require “user interaction” to exploit these. My response to this was finally “I would highly suggest that you not hang your hat on ‘user interaction required’ for protecting your users given that this ‘user interaction’ is simply clicking a link or visiting a webpage.”

I believe that in order to fully protect users, I truly believe that this `localhost` web server solution needs to be removed. Alternative methodologies like registering custom URI handlers (for example, a `zoom://` URI handler) with the browsers is a more secure solution. When these URI handlers are triggered, the browser explicitly prompts the user for confirmation about opening the app. According to the Zoom team, the only reason this `localhost` server continues to exist is that Apple’s Safari doesn’t support URI handlers.

# Consequences

This is essentially a Zero Day. Unfortunately, Zoom has not fixed this vulnerability in the allotted 90-day disclosure window I gave them, as is the industry standard. As such, the 4+ million users of Zoom on Mac are now vulnerable to an invasion of their privacy by using this service.

Additionally, due to a lack of sufficient auto-update capabilities, many users continue to run outdated versions of Zoom for months after new releases are shipped leaving them vulnerable to exploits like these.

# Patch Yourself

If you want to patch this vulnerability for yourself you can do the following.
Disable the ability for Zoom to turn on your webcam when joining a meeting.

![]()

Alternatively, use this terminal command.

Instead of using the UI for the application to disable this, you can also use the terminal.

To shut down the web server, run `lsof -i :19421` to get the PID of the process, then do `kill -9 [process number]`. Then you can delete the `~/.zoomus` directory to remove the web server application files.

To prevent this server from being restored after updates you can execute the following in your terminal:

If you want a full description of how to resolve this on Windows and Mac see the Gist below.

# Notes For Researchers

Given the massive install base for Zoom, I highly recommend that other researchers take the time to explore this Zoom web server to see what other vulnerabilities exist. This being said, I also recommend that any researcher that finds a vulnerability in Zoom’s software **does not directly report the vulnerability to Zoom**. Instead, I recommend that researchers report these vulnerabilities via the [Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/). The ZDI disclosure program gives vendors 120 days to resolve the vulnerability, the ZDI will pay researchers for their work, and researchers have the ability to publicly disclose their findings.

If you want to decompile the Zoom client application for yourself, it’s located in the `~/.zoomus` directory on your computer.

Zoom Video Communications, Inc.
Public Statement
July 8, 2019

In March 2019, a security researcher notified Zoom of some concerns related to the Zoom meetings platform.
Below we detail those concerns and our responses.

VIDEO ON VULNERABILITY
Alleged risk: If an attacker is able to trick a target Zoom user into clicking a web link to the attacker’s Zoom
meeting ID URL, either in an email message or on an internet web server, the target user could unknowingly
join the attacker’s Zoom meeting. If the user has not explicitly configured their Zoom client to disable video
upon joining meetings, the attacker may be able to view the user’s video camera. Because the Zoom client
user interface runs in the foreground upon launch, it would be readily apparent to the user that they had
unintentionally joined a meeting.

Current state: All first-time Zoom users, upon joining their first meeting from a given device, are asked whether
they would like their video to be turned OFF. For subsequent meetings, users can configure their client video
settings to turn OFF video when joining a meeting. Additionally, system administrators can pre-configure video
settings for supported devices at the time of install or change the configuration at anytime.

Future state: As part of our July 2019 release, Zoom will apply and save the user’s video preference from their
first Zoom meeting to all future Zoom meetings. Users and system administrators can still configure their client
video settings to turn OFF video when joining a meeting. This change will apply to all client platforms.

Related to the alleged video-on vulnerability, the researcher references two issues:

1. AUTO JOIN VIA ZOOM LOCAL WEB SERVER (MACS ONLY)

Zoom installs a local web server on Mac devices running the Zoom client. This is a workaround
to an architecture change introduced in Safari 12 that requires a user to accept launching
Zoom before every meeting. The local web server automatically accepts the peripheral access
on behalf of the user to avoid this extra click before joining a meeting. We feel that this is a
legitimate solution to a poor user experience, enabling our users to have seamless,
one-click-to-join meetings, which is our key product differentiator.

2. LOCAL DENIAL OF SERVICE VULNERABILITY

(MACS ONLY)

The security researcher identified a local denial of service vulnerability. A hacker could have
potentially targeted a Mac user who already had the Zoom client installed with an endless loop
of meeting join requests, thereby causing the targeted machine to lock up. We have no
indication that this vulnerability was ever exploited and we released a fix for it in May 2019.

ZOOM SECURITY PROGRAM
Zoom takes all security concerns related to our products very seriously and has a dedicated Security team in
place.

Once this particular issue was brought to our Security team’s attention, we responded within 1 hour, gathering
additional details, and proceeded to perform a risk assessment. Our Security and Engineering teams engaged
the researcher and were in frequent contact over a period of several weeks.

We always recommend that security concerns or issues be routed through our 24/7 support team via
support.zoom.us  We acknowledge that our website currently doesn’t provide clear information for reporting
security concerns. As such, in the next several weeks, Zoom will go live with its public bug bounty program,
supplementing our existing private program. With the program launch, our website will be updated with a web
submission form for all security-related concerns. Non-disclosure on a bug bounty program is common industry
practice that provides vendors the flexibility to determine whether or not a vulnerability warrants public
disclosure.

It includes the classic tropes: \* Our users don’t care about security. > Our video-first platform is a key benefit to our users around the world, and our customers have told us that they choose Zoom for our frictionless video communications experience. \* We have no way of knowing if this has been exploited in the wild, so it’s probably fine > Also of note, we have no indication that this has ever happened. \* Other products have the same vulnerability > We are not alone among video conferencing providers in implementing this solution. \* We decided not to fix it > Ultimately, Zoom decided not to change the application functionality And also a lovely one I haven’t seen before: \* We tried to buy the researcher’s silence, but he refused > Upon his initial communication to Zoom, the researcher asked whether Zoom provides bounties for security vulnerability submissions. Zoom invited the researcher to join our private paid bug bounty program, which he declined because of non-disclosure terms. It is common industry practice to require non-disclosure for private bug bounty programs. 1.

It is common industry practice to require non-disclosure for private bug bounty programs. Is an NDA really "common industry practice" for bug bounty programs? I know NDAs are common for pen-testing but it seems like an odd (and kind of dishonest) requirement for a bug bounty program. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Kalium](user?id=Kalium) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20393742)   | [root](#20389812) | [parent](#20392877) | [next](#20393934) [–]  Some kind of NDA terms are not unheard-of. Like a 1-3 month period in which to work on things during which disclosures won't go out. That said, there's a slight disconnect between Zoom's two statements here. The first is that the researcher declined out of concerns over Zoom's NDA. The second is that NDAs are common. What this *doesn't* say is that Zoom's NDA is cookie-cutter or what the specific terms are. If I were to guess, Zoom was using some unusual NDA and attempting to buy permanent silence. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [elliekelly](user?id=elliekelly) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20394064)   | [root](#20389812) | [parent](#20393742) | [next](#20395792) [–]  Thanks for the explanation. That makes sense and seems pretty reasonable. The company should certainly have the opportunity to fix the vulnerability before it's made public and could be exploited. > If I were to guess, Zoom was using some unusual NDA and attempting to buy permanent silence. Considering that Zoom ultimately decided not to correct the issue I suspect you're right. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Kalium](user?id=Kalium) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20394198)   | [root](#20389812) | [parent](#20394064) | [next](#20395792) [–]  From the Medium post: > - Offered and declined a financial bounty for the report due to policy on not being able to publicly disclose even after the vulnerability was patched. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JakeTheAndroid](user?id=JakeTheAndroid) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20395792)   | [root](#20389812) | [parent](#20393742) | [prev](#20394064) | [next](#20393934) [–]  I'd have to guess this as well. I have dealt with a number of public and private bounties, and not one of the researchers has ever rejected an NDA or not allowed us time to remediate before they could disclose this information to 3rd parties. Unless you count Tavis tweeting critical findings I guess. And to be fair, none of the times I've engaged a private bounty have been due to some massively critical bug that impacted privacy or could hijack parts of client systems. I could see that if the researcher worked with Zoom and didn't feel like they took it seriously they would refuse this and just disclose it due to the impact it has. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Kalium](user?id=Kalium) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20395894)   | [root](#20389812) | [parent](#20395792) | [next](#20393934) [–]  The researcher makes it clear that they rejected the NDA because it was a permanent gag on any discussion (even after patching). With that in mind, and this clearly being an intentional design, I can see why it might come off as Zoom not taking the issue seriously. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [darkarmani](user?id=darkarmani) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20393934)   | [root](#20389812) | [parent](#20392877) | [prev](#20393742) | [next](#20392646) [–]  Will they pay the rest of your team and your spouse as well? "I've already sent these results to a few colleagues around the world to test out, but don't worry, they won't disclose anything for 90 days". | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hamburglar](user?id=hamburglar) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20392646)   | [parent](#20389812) | [prev](#20392877) | [next](#20393792) [–]  Also, they seem almost entirely focused on "unwittingly joining a meeting" as the real problem here, ignoring the fact that they have made the *extremely poor choice* of exposing a dodgy control API on your mac to the entire internet. What are the odds there are no bugs in this shitty little HTTP server they snuck onto everyone's machine? The fact that they came within *five days* of losing control of one of the domains that has the power to install arbitrary code on every mac running this thing is absolutely insane, and they should be asking themselves 1) how that happened, and 2) how utterly screwed they would have been if they lost control of that domain. In a more amusing alternate universe, someone discovered the zoomgov.com vulnerability, waited until it expired, snapped it up, then published an "update" that uninstalls zoom entirely. In a nastier one, they used this idiotic design flaw to pwn every zoom client machine out there. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nerdjon](user?id=nerdjon) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20393792)   | [parent](#20389812) | [prev](#20392646) | [next](#20391220) [–]  It's exactly how you want to respond if you plan on sharing it publicly on Twitter in the hopes of fooling those not in tech. If my mom stumbled into that article, she would likely think they perfectly explained everything (well... she would likely contact me but, still). Given this news is already not sticking near the top of hacker news and barely reported elsewhere, it feels like they are already getting away with it for the most part. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [azernik](user?id=azernik) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20396656)   | [root](#20389812) | [parent](#20393792) | [next](#20391220) [–]  Problem is, your mom is not in their market; their paying customers have paid IT people who *do* pay attention.

People behaved pretty good considering it was a random public Zoom call (except for a few trolls, but nothing really bad).

This made me think - is there any website that facilitates you to do such public conferences on zoom like clients. Basically a bunch of people who are interested in a certain topic could join and chime in - go from topic to topic. It could be a very healthy discussion. People could post and schedule meetings and essentially anyone who wants to learn could join. I do listen to podcasts often, but such meetings would be pretty different than podcasts.

However what I fear is that they will become like any other modern forum in that you will need heavy moderation, people will try to troll, etc. The beautiful thing about Jonathan's call was it's spontaneity I think, and that everyone was so excited to talk about the vulnerability that the group had a single focus. I might be too cynical so maybe it's a good idea, and if someone suggest a place/site/forum to have these kind of discussions I would definitely try it out. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cconover](user?id=cconover) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20397545)   | [parent](#20388242) | [prev](#20389385) | [next](#20388839) [–]  Interestingly, I implemented every mitigation listed in the article: kill the web server process, remove and add an empty directory at `~/.zoomus` to prevent it being re-added, remove Firefox's content type action for Zoom, and disable video turning on when Zoom launches. When I visit a Zoom join link or the POC link above, Firefox prompts me to open the Zoom client to join the meeting, and when I click "Open Link" the client opens just as it should and joins the meeting. This seems to confirm that there is no functionality to create a seamless experience for the user that actually requires the presence of the web server. If you don't have the client installed the page can prompt you to download it the same as it would the very first time you download and install it. You can ask your browser to remember the link association and not be prompted for which app the link should open going forward. These are minor steps, even for a regular user, and ones with which most users are likely already familiar. To me this further illustrates that the web server is truly just a ploy on Zoom's part to keep their hooks in users' systems, and have a way in that the user isn't privy to. Any other excuse they are giving about "enhanced experience" is dubious at best and deceitful at worst. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kevlened](user?id=kevlened) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20397927)   | [root](#20388242) | [parent](#20397545) | [next](#20388839) [–]  It seems the web server "is a workaround to a change introduced in Safari 12": <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20389668> > You can ask your browser to remember the link association If that's true in Safari, then a web server is using dynamite to kill a fly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Jlleitschuh](user?id=Jlleitschuh) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388839)   | [parent](#20388242) | [prev](#20397545) | [next](#20388502) [–]  If you want to see some part of this fixed, please UPVOTE this issue: <https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/143> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nradov](user?id=nradov) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388502)   | [parent](#20388242) | [prev](#20388839) | [next](#20391308) [–]  Have your checked for similar vulnerabilities in competing products such as GoToMeeting and WebEx?

The local web server enables users to avoid this extra click before joining every meeting. We feel that this is a legitimate solution to a poor user experience problem, enabling our users to have faster, one-click-to-join meetings. We are not alone among video conferencing providers in implementing this solution. I do not believe that this is a fair trade-off given that any website can act on this locally installed server. EDIT: I think they need to be made aware that this isn't acceptable. My reply to their support team: I do not believe this is a fair trade-off - allowing any arbitrary web site local control of privileged software installed on my machine - because Safari offers a security prompt (specifically so that any arbitrary web site does not gain control of privileged software on my machine).

A general purpose OS runs what the user installs. This is purely on zoom for backdooring the system. I'm not sure how many Mac users bother running ps every once in a while, but it seems like it wouldn't be that hard to detect either. That said I have to say zoom's the only businessy meeting client I've used that doesn't require running through hoops on Linux.

Zoom is in the damn AppStore. The whole point of making the AppStore a walled garden is such that these things don't happen. If an AppStore App can install a server in your machine that remains there and reinstalls the App after it has been deleted, and can be used to spy you via the camera or DDoS you.

Oh, definitely. I cancelled my subscription because of this, but I wonder if the reason will make it through the corporate fog. What is worrying is that more and more companies think it is fine to install "helpers", "openers" and other cruft.

I was curious about how this amazing bit of functionality was implemented and how it had been implemented securely. Come to find out, it really hadn’t been implemented securely. Nor can I figure out a good way to do this that doesn’t require an additional bit of user interaction to be secure. Does anybody understand (and have a moment to explain) why the author says this is difficult to do securely? macOS has a simple facility for handling custom URL schemes, so my impulse would be to have `[https://zoom.us/j/492468757`](https://zoom.us/j/492468757%60) do a server-side redirect to a URL like, say, `zoomus://492468757`, which would launch Zoom locally using the OS's built-in services. This wouldn't require a third-party daemon of any sort, and would just be a regular application that the user could trivially uninstall. Is there a security hole there that I'm missing? Or have I misunderstood the author's point? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [spaceribs](user?id=spaceribs) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388317)   | [parent](#20388241) | [next](#20389415) [–]  A custom URI wouldn't work as seamlessly as zoom's UX team would have liked. If you hadn't installed zoom, either a nasty message would tell you the protocol wasn't supported, or it would redirect you to a google search. Their answer was to send people to a URL they controlled and brought you through the install process as easily as possible, but the issue they needed to solve was determining if you needed to have an install or just redirect to the app. They broke so many security rules just to shave off a few inconvenient seconds, and those seconds rose them to the top. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [omk](user?id=omk) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20389325)   | [root](#20388241) | [parent](#20388317) | [next](#20388663) [–]  Am I the only one seeing the pattern here.

It still has at least several issues: \* When Zoom is already installed: - should be able to handle most instances - needs to account for version management, eg installed version zoom could still be version that is too old to process the uri correctly. Version could be in the uri. When Zoom is not installed: - an information dialog needs to be somehow shown to the receiving user, asking them if they want to install 'Zoom'. - that screen must include the 'uri' and validate certificates etc to prevent abuse (hence must necessarily be 'ugly' and not 'seamless') - the language on that dialog has to be provided by the OS/Browser, not the software vendor, to prevent abuse. For similar reasons the Windows UAC dialog text can't be written by the vendor. - the language employed by the OS/Browser has to of necessity be fairly neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging installation, to prevent abuse. This is necessarily at odds with the UI principle of leading the inexperienced user through clear steps to achieve their intended goal. - the user of average-to-lower-quartile experience, as of 2019, for a product with a client base of 40 million+, is likely not in a position to meaningfully distinguish a legitimate Zoom install uri from a malicious / imposter one. Hence any popular software using this install-from-uri-handler becomes an appealing target for malicious actors to mimic, which they will. - some proportion of users will likely install from malicious links, and whichever product (let's say Zoom for example) is the most likely software for malicious actors to masquerade as will become the name associated with the attack in the mind of the wounded public | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [clinta](user?id=clinta) [on July 10, 2019](item?id=20400925)   | [root](#20388241) | [parent](#20399336) | [next](#20402056) [–]  Those are some interesting points. I'm not convinced that versions should be in scope for this sort of thing though. If I'm writing a protocol handler, I think it's my responsibility to make sure my software can update itself, and make the default behavior that it should check for updates if it is given a URI it doesn't understand. Secondly, version checks assume that the user wants to run this specific protocol handler. I as the user might prefer to run an open source non-official zoom client. I think the OS should only be trying to help me if I don't have any handler. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wbl](user?id=wbl) [on July 10, 2019](item?id=20402056)   | [root](#20388241) | [parent](#20399336) | [prev](#20400925) | [next](#20389185) [–]  The UA could go to the handler site which would be a landing page. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [monocasa](user?id=monocasa) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20389185)   | [root](#20388241) | [parent](#20389136) | [prev](#20390953) | [next](#20390509) [–]  They have the opposite starting with Catalina and iOS, Universal Links that lets an app register to take the first pass at handling zoom.us URLs.

The JS is a bit messy and requires a few different approaches but it works on all popular browsers on Windows and Mac (Linux support wasn’t needed, so not sure).

A malicious website can still redirect you to a zoom.us URL that will instantly join the meeting without confirmation.

My point is that preventing this situation from happening in the first place, through better sandboxing restrictions, is both more fair and more effective than having each app be individually approved. If you try to mitigate this just with app review, then 1) you're going to miss apps that do bad things, and 2) It introduces huge conflicts of interest for the reviewer. But if you were to have effective sandboxing, it wouldn't be possible for Zoom or any other app to do this in the first place, so that you would be able to trust the apps that you install even if they haven't been reviewed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tiborsaas](user?id=tiborsaas) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20389413)   | [parent](#20388111) | [prev](#20388602) | [next](#20396674) [–]  What reinstall feature? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [CaptainMarvel](user?id=CaptainMarvel) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20390255)   | [root](#20388111) | [parent](#20389413) | [next](#20389836) [–]  This "feature": [https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/358651/unable-to-c...](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/358651/unable-to-completely-uninstall-zoom-meeting-app) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [swish\_bob](user?id=swish_bob) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20389836)   | [root](#20388111) | [parent](#20389413) | [prev](#20390255) | [next](#20396674) [–]  It silently reinstalls if you follow any Zoom meeting link. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thijsvandien](user?id=thijsvandien) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20390112)   | [root](#20388111) | [parent](#20389836) | [next](#20396674) [–]  For which loading an iFrame by visiting a website or opening an email is enough... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bgentry](user?id=bgentry) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20396674)   | [prev](#20388111) | [next](#20389953) [–]  In response to all of the well-deserved criticism, Zoom just made two updates to their blog post[1] to announce that they will be completely removing the webserver for all macOS users in a new release *tonight*, and also adding an option prompt going forward: *JULY 9 PATCH: The patch planned for tonight (July 9) at or before 12:00 AM PT will do the following: 1. Remove the local web server entirely, once the Zoom client has been updated – We are stopping the use of a local web server on Mac devices. Once the patch is deployed, Mac users will be prompted in the Zoom user interface (UI) to update their client. Once the update is complete, the local web server will be completely removed on that device. 2. Allow users to manually uninstall Zoom – We’re adding a new option to the Zoom menu bar that will allow users to manually and completely uninstall the Zoom client, including the local web server. Once the patch is deployed, a new menu option will appear that says, “Uninstall Zoom.” By clicking that button, Zoom will be completely removed from the user’s device along with the user’s saved settings. PLANNED JULY RELEASE: Additionally, we have a planned release this weekend (July 12) that will address another security concern: video on by default. With this release: 1. First-time users who select the “Always turn off my video” box will automatically have their video preference saved. The selection will automatically be applied to the user’s Zoom client settings and their video will be OFF by default for all future meetings. 2. Returning users can update their video preferences and make video OFF by default at any time through the Zoom client settings.*  Edit: the new version is now released at <https://zoom.us/download> [1]: [https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2019/07/08/response-to-video-...](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2019/07/08/response-to-video-on-concern/) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [heleninboodler](user?id=heleninboodler) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20396850)   | [parent](#20396674) | [next](#20397257) [–]  > Remove the local web server entirely Thank goodness.

The linked stackoverflow question mostly seemed to be someone who was confused about how CORS works, and the issue in the Google Chrome tracker was closed as WontFix because they couldn't reproduce it and said it should work. I'm nearly positive that CORS from localhost works OK. I set this up all the time for local development. For example, I run a client CRA app on localhost:3000 and an API on localhost:3001. The API sets the CORS headers and the CRA app can make requests to it. If this is correct then I believe all Zoom needed to do is have their localhost application set CORS headers for their production domain. This would have allowed AJAX communication and *only* allowed it for Javascript running on their domain. Instead they did this totally hacky method that lets the whole world interact with the localhost server... Maybe I missed something but if they *could* have done this the right way and didn't that is much worse IMO... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [spaceribs](user?id=spaceribs) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388906)   | [parent](#20388794) | [next](#20389057) [–]  You're 100% correct, and while someone has pointed out the proper headers that need to be set on the bug report here: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=67743>, it's been drowned out by people who don't seem to understand the issue: [http://williambert.online/2013/06/allow-cors-with-localhost-...](http://williambert.online/2013/06/allow-cors-with-localhost-in-chrome/) CORS is hard, I've struggled on it several times, and I'm not surprised an engineer gave up trying to fix it because of deadlines. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tumetab1](user?id=tumetab1) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20391256)   | [root](#20388794) | [parent](#20388906) | [next](#20389057) [–]  Can confirm, CORS (Origin: ramdomsite.tld to localhost) works just fine in Chrome.

Since images are being loaded by the browser (second party), there is no such protection, since a third party should not be able to read them anyway (barring some other vulnerability).

This was because my origin site was accessed through an HTTPS connection and the localhost server was only HTTP. That's one potential reason Zoom might have opted to use their <img> garbage; since <img> elements are passive not active content, they could avoid using HTTPS on the localhost webserver. That's not a good excuse, but clearly they weren't interested in finding a good solution -- whatever the problem that prompted the <img> hack was. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [chrisfosterelli](user?id=chrisfosterelli) [on July 10, 2019](item?id=20400012)   | [root](#20388794) | [parent](#20398376) | [next](#20404709) [–]  Very interesting, thank you!

Normally this would be pretty obvious, wouldn't it? Users would see Zoom open into some weird meeting, and close it. Presuming the exploit cannot avoid bringing the Zoom app to the foreground when it joins the meeting and activates the camera/mic. If it can do that and stay in the background, all bets are off. In spite of its obviousness, it's still pretty darn scary -- Scenario 1: malicious website/app opens link while you're sitting there. You're sitting in front of your computer, you see Zoom open, you're like "WTF?!", close that shit, uninstall Zoom; hopefully discover how to permanently remove it (it otherwise leaves a localhost http server running that can reinstall itself). But *crap* the hijackers have, even with a few seconds of video: your face, your surroundings, the audio of your surroundings, all of which can increasingly be fingerprinted. That alone is very scary. Just to be in an unintentional meeting for a moment is very disturbing. A violation of sorts. Scenario 2: malicious website/app delays opening the link until some threshold of mouse/KB inactivity is reached. Activate the Zoom link and hope the person is AFK. Spy on their home/office/whatever. Also a violation. Are there other scenarios I am missing? Personal note 1: I'm happy I switched to a Linux laptop after finding last year's MBPs disappointing (and the TB revolting; I have a physical escape key!). Personal note 2: I do actually like Zoom a lot, it's an awesome video conferencing app. But this should be fixed for Mac users. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bigiain](user?id=bigiain) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388880)   | [parent](#20388781) | [next](#20389125) [–]  I wonder if this works in an electron app (like Slack maybe) displaying it?

In my business -- project management software -- I'm in online meetings a LOT (say, 20 hours a week?) because everyone in my company is remote. We have never, ever used video. It just doesn't come up. Nobody wants it internally, and none of our customers ask for it in external meetings. I don't think any of them use it internally, either (and many of our customers are large, distributed organizations with offices all over the place). This seems normal to me. My neighbor is an IT VP for a health care concern. She travels a lot (30-40%), and when she's home she's in online meetings pretty much all the time. And in her company, video is ALWAYS included. I have no idea why, and neither does she; it's a cultural thing. The upshot, though, is that I work in t-shirts and cargo shorts, and she has to be "office ready" even though she works at home. However, I will note that, if I run into her outside when she's walking the dog, it's not unusual to see her in a nice blouse, hair and makeup done, but wearing yoga pants or whatever. Which is its own kind of hilarious. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ramraj07](user?id=ramraj07) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20390736)   | [root](#20389096) | [parent](#20390156) | [prev](#20391298) | [next](#20391891) [–]  Sounds like false security thiugh- at least the camera has a light (which last I heard has been hardware level synced with the camera) so you know if someone's watching but what you have no control over is the microphone | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [stordoff](user?id=stordoff) [on July 10, 2019](item?id=20399276)   | [root](#20389096) | [parent](#20390736) | [next](#20391891) [–]  Just audio is still an improvement over audio and video. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [solidasparagus](user?id=solidasparagus) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20391891)   | [root](#20389096) | [parent](#20390156) | [prev](#20390736) | [next](#20391069) [–]  Video meetings are so much more effective than audio meetings.

As far as supporting local content: Historically a lot of terrible (read: Enterprise, H&R Block tax software, etc) apps are glorified webpages, coupled with a local server that provides things like FS access and malware installation. Those apps use a kludge of remote and localhost urls, and generally expect to work. I suspect at this point though that browsers will just start going for the "no access to localhost" route as this practice is mercifully dying out (alas in favor of Electron apps shipping full, but out of date, browsers). To me the bigger problem is: Zoom installed a server on a machine, without consent, with the ability to install software (without consent). Removing the browser's access to that service doesn't mean anything because an attacker can always just directly attack the server. Even if the server locks connections to exclusively coming from localhost they've provided a service that can install and launch software, which can therefore be used as a sandbox escape - e.g a super constrained network service gets compromised - the idea is that service can't modify the filesystem or what have you, but now it can just connect to localhost and get a file written to disk. People keep on complaining about apple "locking down the system", but its because of developers like Zoom that Apple needs to do this: and average user is not going to see this post, and Zoom has clearly decided that it is in their interests to leave a service running that can install software for them. I hope that apple drops the XProtect hammer on the server binary, and the ban hammer on their signing cert. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nojvek](user?id=nojvek) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388627)   | [root](#20388453) | [parent](#20388521) | [next](#20388635) [–]  Yes, but blocking browser access to localhost from non localhost pages would stop the attack by simply visiting a webpage.

Now, something I do that most people probably don't is periodically check StartupItems as well as the LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons folders, so I can remove anything left over. I do not mean to trivialize this problem, because what Zoom has done here is egregious and unforgivable, BUT is it accurate to say that the reinstall behavior depends on 1, usage of Chrome and 2, the presence of a StartupItem / LaunchAgent / LaunchDaemon?

Admittedly the implementation might not have been the best from a usability perspective but I think any attempt at implementing proper privilege management in Windows would have had many users complaining and not seeing the point. I guess the lesson here is not to give your users bad habits for the sake of convenience otherwise it'll backfire if you ever want to do things right later. MS had everybody run as root for decades before they finally decided that it might not be such a great idea after all, and then they had to face annoyed users and bad publicity. That being said I can't really imagine how having a non-intrusive "do you want to start the call" dialog before initiating the call can be considered a deal breaker. I assume you could even reduce that annoyance further by adding a "don't ask me again for this website/user/whatever" checkbox. Do you really think that would hurt Zoom significantly? I've never used their product so I can't really form an educated opinion. This is especially stupid because I have no doubt that now that it's been made public some people *will* abuse the vulnerability, if only for fun. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Crinus](user?id=Crinus) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20390564)   | [root](#20389867) | [parent](#20390064) | [next](#20390873) [–]  It wasn't bad habits, up to Windows XP which introduced user separation on consumer oriented Windows (NT and 2K were meant for businesses and businesses who had networked PCs were really meant to use those) all personal computers were fully controlled by their users without any notion of privilege separation - this is a behavior that traces its lineage back to the original Altair 8800. Computers weren't networked and those who were were either running a different OS (NT, Unix, whatever) and/or controlled entirely by a single entity (a company). Or just didn't care and used Windows 9x. And honestly i do not think it is bad habit even today. UAC *is* intrusive, the main reason you do not see it as much as at the past is because applications nowadays work around it: see how Chrome or even VS Code saves the executable files for their updates to your %APPDATA% folder (where normally regular data are going) to avoid the UAC annoyance of going through Program Files (which makes the UAC protection pointless) or how app stores like Steam change the permissions to "everything allowed" to be able to modify the folder contents. People are using computers to do specific tasks they want to do, anything else is an annoyance and something they'll want to avoid. Today's security issues come from things a lot of developers and companies simply do not want to acknowledge: trying to put everything online, connect all computers together, trying to have everything controlled by whoever writes the applications users use (putting everything online is a way to do that), trying to come up with monetization schemes where users pay nothing out of their own pockets, trying to make users pay subscriptions instead of one-off fees (the excuse is often that they have to somehow keep their servers going, willfully ignoring that the developers/companies are those who decided to make something run on a server in the first place and that by doing that they are the ones in control). A lot of security issues would be gone if computers weren't so connected to each other. Sadly i do not see that happening any time soon since no developer wants to give up that sort of control (some developers nowadays do not even *know* how it is to not have it) and no company wants to get rid of the biggest excuse they have to ask for continuous payments. Personal computers back in the 80s and 90s were very insecure, but that didn't matter because they weren't so connected as they are today. It isn't surprising that pretty much all famous security issues of the time (like the ILOVEYOU worm) happened exactly as that connectivity started getting widespread. I think the only hope there is is that the IoT craze will blow up everyone's collective faces and realize that it might not be such a good idea to connect everything after all. Sadly the more cynical side of me thinks that what will happen instead is the introduction of more draconian user hostile measures which end up with the users losing every more control to big companies that control their devices and OSes in the name of security and usability (more like dumbability) and any voice against that would be marginalized as "you are a power user, you do not matter" (ok princess, then what are power users supposed to use after you lock down everything? - i guess the answer is somewhere between "expensive licensed workstations" and "nothing, now piss off"). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [yoz-y](user?id=yoz-y) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20391049)   | [root](#20389867) | [parent](#20390564) | [next](#20390884) [–]  I’ve had viruses and anti viruses years before I had internet.

I mean, sure, but having computer connected together is pretty damn amazing. I'm actually drawing the opposite conclusion compared to yours: I think UAC doesn't go far enough. You need more finely grained permissions. That seems to be the trend too: Android, SELinux, OpenBSD's pledge... It's all about giving every process only the privileges it needs and nothing more. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Crinus](user?id=Crinus) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20392023)   | [root](#20389867) | [parent](#20390884) | [next](#20390873) [–]  Finely grained permissions mean bad UX and as Android has shown you gain nothing practical from that since the people will learn to ignore them pretty much like they learn to ignore the UAC warning while on the other hand you lose the flexibility, functionality and openness of the entire system (all significant pillars for ensuring user control). Note that i'm not saying to disconnect computers entirely, i'm saying to rely less on connected computers. Simple stuff like use LibreOffice or MS Office instead of Google Docs, use a desktop calendar and other tools instead of relying on "web apps", instead of using a "cloud-based solution" for syncing data with your mobile phone, just connect it directly to your computer (via wifi, bluetooth, whatever - this is a UX issue mainly - but it doesn't have to roundtrip with someone else's server). Stuff that makes you and your computer less reliant on the network. Not everything can work like that of course, but then instead of trying to isolate applications from each other using fine-grained separation, we can simply treat the network itself as hostile and try to defend from it (e.g. applications that can access the network cannot access outside of a designated folder - the OpenBSD pledge approach but forced on all applications that access the network). I think it is a much easier, flexible, user controllable and understandable approach than UAC on steroids or any other approach that relies on application segregation. It does require a massive shift in developers' mindsets and profit incentives for companies though, which is why i do not see such a thing happening. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TeMPOraL](user?id=TeMPOraL) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20392524)   | [root](#20389867) | [parent](#20392023) | [next](#20392746) [–]  > *we can simply treat the network itself as hostile and try to defend from it (e.g. applications that can access the network cannot access outside of a designated folder - the OpenBSD pledge approach but forced on all applications that access the network)* Won't work. Malicious actors (both malware developers and companies with user-hostile business models) will start working around it, by for instance giving you *two* applications, one connected to the Internet and one not. The first application will be the C&C server, the second one will be the executor, and they'll talk with each other over e.g. files in first application's folder. Trying to block that would pretty much hose all utility in having a general-purpose computer. You'll be back to the crappy UX of a smartphone. I honestly don't know how to solve this conundrum. You can't solve it technologically, as you quickly hit the Halting Problem. You can't solve it socially, because for any power user benefiting from the modicum of interoperability you leave in, you get 10 regular people who can be trivially social-engineered into selfpwning their device.

Of course it requires a huge shift in how you design applications, but it does not impose any burden on the user's side really. They just allow $APP access to some data or resource, and then it has access to *only* what it needs going forward, with no need to allow it every time (unless you revoke it).

Furthermore, in Chrome, the webpage can set a timeout which brings the browser window back into focus. So for example, if Zoom usually takes about 1 second to open, then the browser could set the timeout for 1100ms, so that zoom is only visible to the user for a split second before it's backgrounded with their camera enabled. Either of the following will bring Chrome back to the foreground: ```     setTimeout( function() { alert("Hi") }, 1100)      setTimeout( function() { var win = window.open("https://www.google.com", '_blank'); win.focus(); window.close() }, 1100)  ``` The latter is a little less of an alert to the user that something has happened, since it could be used to reload the current page without the offending image or iframe tag, which would look to the user like the page just randomly reloaded itself. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rdl](user?id=rdl) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20389473)   | [prev](#20393161) | [next](#20388784) [–]  If you do this audio-only there isn’t a telltale LED on the camera to give away that you are doing it.

An audio alert that the microphone has turned on would obviously be rejected by consumers, unless maybe some fancy processing were used to remove that alert sound from the recording. But even so, an audio alert would presumably only play once while the indicator light remains illuminated the entire time. On the other hand while an indicator light is good for the camera, it's not sufficient for audio. If the computer is facing away from me, then the camera can't see me so my inability to see the camera light isn't that huge of a deal. But audio goes around corners so I could be recorded by a computer not immediately in eyesight. If there were some reasonable third sensory channel to available for "out of band" communication, that would be ideal. But consumers will reject smell-alerts. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [xhgdvjky](user?id=xhgdvjky) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20389578)   | [parent](#20389473) | [prev](#20389490) | [next](#20402385) [–]  id much rather the zoom conference can't do anything unless I let it | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dclowd9901](user?id=dclowd9901) [on July 10, 2019](item?id=20402385)   | [parent](#20389473) | [prev](#20389578) | [next](#20388784) [–]  A hacker could turn the light on and off before you even knew what to do about it.

Zoom decided they know better than the Safari team and decided to install this local webserver specifically to bypass the operating system's security policies, supposedly because "it is their key differentiator" or whatever. Basically their product managers decided they wanted it to work a certain way and demanded someone do whatever nasty hacks were necessary to make it happen. It turns out their nasty hack doesn't set the proper CORS policy so any random webpage can force you to join a meeting. It also turns out they don't do what mac apps are supposed to do: keep this crap inside the app bundle so dragging the app to the trash effectively uninstalls everything. Instead they install to ~/.zoomus, don't document that fact, and if you hit a zoom link after "uninstalling" they automatically reinstall themselves. Oh and they let the registration for one of their domains expire and nearly lost control of it, which would make this a RCE because their client doesn't do anything to validate their update packages as far as anyone can tell.

This is how I've always installed it. Do this from an empty directory, though, since it will just spray files everywhere... \* Use `xar` to extract the contents of the .pkg file: ```     $ xar -xf Zoom.pkg  ``` \* Use `cpio` to extract the payload, which is in a file oddly named "Scripts": ```     $ mkdir payload && cd payload     $ cpio -i -d < ../Scripts  ``` \* The app bundle is compressed within a 7z archive, but the .pkg file contains a precompiled decompressor. Either use that or install your own (e.g. via Homebrew) to extract the app bundle: ```     $ 7zr x zm.7z  ``` Now you will have a directory called "zoom.us.app", which is the app bundle. Move this to wherever you want it to live, and now you've "installed" the app without running the scripts from the .pkg. Importantly, note that the app will still exhibit the behavior discussed in the article. When you run it the first time, it will install ZoomOpener, which is the helper app that includes the web server. It will not install any browser extensions, however, which is the behavior I was originally trying to avoid by going through this procedure. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bloopernova](user?id=bloopernova) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20394083)   | [root](#20389613) | [parent](#20392533) | [next](#20395240) [–]  This is good info, thank you for sharing it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [favorited](user?id=favorited) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20395240)   | [root](#20389613) | [parent](#20391828) | [prev](#20392533) | [next](#20389945) [–]  I almost never run .pkg installers either.

This is a workaround to a change introduced in Safari 12 that requires a user to confirm that they want to start the Zoom client prior to joining every meeting. The local web server enables users to avoid this extra click before joining every meeting. We feel that this is a legitimate solution to a poor user experience problem, enabling our users to have faster, one-click-to-join meetings. We are not alone among video conferencing providers in implementing this solution. A workaround to legitimate Safari security improvements. I hope the Wall Street Journal and CNBC skewer this company and shred the stock price. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [PixyMisa](user?id=PixyMisa) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388907)   | [prev](#20392584) | [next](#20423017) [–]  Zoom is why my shiny 27" Retina iMac is decorated with a small square of black electrical tape. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [figiel](user?id=figiel) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20391267)   | [parent](#20388907) | [next](#20390144) [–]  It always makes me wonder why people keep tape on camera sensor but don't care about microphones.

If you look on Twitter, anyone that has complained about this (huge) vulnerability is being redirected back to their blog post. To make things worse, most non-technical users that have caught onto these posts are replying to say "thanks for sorting it out!" This wouldn't be the first time a company sweeps a data leak or vulnerability under the rug. I remember when the Panera Bread stuff kicked off, and all they had to do was bury their head in the sand and wait for the storm to pass.

It's hard to imagine a competent engineer not understanding the security implications of building something like this.

I did a test with myself and a coworker. I’m using macOS 10.12; he’s using 10.14. We both have up-to-date Zoom clients. In our Zoom clients, we both already had the “Turn off my video when joining a meeting” box checked. I set up a meeting, with participant video set to On, as the article describes. I took the new Meeting ID, launched Zoom, and joined my new meeting. I then sent my coworker the join URL using Slack. My coworker clicked on the link, which opened the URL in Safari. Safari asked my coworker if he wanted to launch Zoom. My coworker confirmed that yes, he wanted to launch Zoom. My coworker’s Zoom client did \_not\_ automatically start video.

The traditional view (which I think was widespread in the 90s or whatever) was that engineers who find vulnerabilities in products have a special responsibility to the public, and owe a duty to the *people at risk*: the users of the product (or whoever would be harmed if the vulnerability were exploited to malicious ends). Just like if you used your training as an engineer to discover that the Bay Bridge had a structural flaw and that drivers were at risk (or, in the case of Diane Hartley, that the new Citicorp Center had a design flaw and officeworkers were at risk). And this duty can be discharged a few ways, but often the most efficient way to help the people at risk is to educate the vendor and keep on their ass until they fix the problem in a free update. If the vendor pays you, fantastic, but you shouldn't accept payment that would prevent you from discharging your duty to the people actually harmed by the vulnerability's existence (e.g., if you take the vendor's money and it comes with an indefinite NDA, and they never fix the problem and the users remain at risk of being harmed by bad actors forever, you have not behaved acceptably as an engineer). This view probably emerged at a time when bug-finders mostly had salaried jobs and were privileged not to have to depend on payments from the same vendors they were annoying with information on their product's flaws. A newer view (probably informed by bug bounties, etc., and also a broader community of people doing this stuff) seems to "no more free bugs for software vendors" -- that researchers who find vulnerabilities in commercial products are producing knowledge that's of value to the vendor, and the vendor ought to give them compensation for it, and if the vendor doesn't want to do that, the researcher would basically just be doing uncompensated labor to give it to the vendor, and is free to go sell the fruits of their discovery to somebody who does value their labor instead. Even if that means selling the bug to unknown counterparties at auction and signing a forever NDA not to tell anybody else. The first view is mostly what we teach students in Stanford's undergrad computer-ethics course and what I think is consistent with the rest of the literature on engineering ethics (and celebrated examples like Diane Hartley and William LeMessurier, etc.), but I do think it seems to be out-of-step with the prevailing view among contemporary vuln-finders. I'd love to find some reading where this is carefully discussed that we could assign students. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tlb](user?id=tlb) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388628)   | [root](#20388097) | [parent](#20388395) | [next](#20388953) [–]  I can't imagine selling bugs to the highest bidder ever becoming ethically acceptable. You can't pretend not to know that the high bidder is probably a cybercriminal. If you do this, your hat is clearly black. Once upon a time, vulnerabilities were just nuisances and people could justify some gray-hat casuistry when the damage was just some sysadmin overtime to clean up. But now there are serious organized crime rings and rogue nation-states using vulnerabilities to steal and extort billions and ruin people's lives. It's OK to choose not to work on products with no bug bounties, but if you do find a bug in one you must disclose it responsibly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Thorrez](user?id=Thorrez) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20389181)   | [root](#20388097) | [parent](#20388628) | [next](#20388953) [–]  >you must disclose it responsibly.

In larger society these sorts of problems are solved through regulations. For example if someone identifies a structural vulnerability in a bridge, the agency in charge of the bridge has a legal obligation to take steps to fix it. That sort of regulation doesn't exist in software land. The second view as you describe it (selling to the highest bidder) is clearly black hat, but it is completely ethical for a researcher to disclose a vulnerability to the public if the vendor doesn't fix it in a reasonable amount of time.

The reason for that is that at the time CORS was designed lots of sites loaded images from other sites and because images where considered static content that didn't change the server this was at worst a information leak. What Zoom has done here is abuse a HTTP GET via a <img> tag (which is not supposed to change anything) as a way to trigger a privileged local process to INSTALL software (among other things). This is a classic XSS and is number 7 on the OWASP TOP 10 vulnerability list (2017 version). For Zoom to contract as BAA with HIPAA regulated clients and various other bodies they had agree that they would NOT do this and that they had security teams and audit processes in place to prevent this sort of thing. Nearly ALL of our client contracts require we be aware of and mitigate AT LEAST the OWASP TOP 10. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nop\_slide](user?id=nop_slide) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20393101)   | [root](#20389825) | [parent](#20392920) | [next](#20394823) [–]  Thanks for the info! I still don't fully understand \_why\_ they had to do this hack if they own the localhost server. They could just set CORS to be '\*' and lax their CSP. Then they would be able to get data with JS. For example this website can see any localserver on your network with open CORS since it appears they laxed their CSP.

By the way, I'm not trying to argue that this researcher behaved unethically, just sharing another option.

I’m also a little concerned about how some parts of the article don’t match up. For example, the “UPDATE: June 7th, 2019:” does not have (as far as I can see) a matching entry in the Timeline. There is an entry for July 7, noting a regression; but there is an update the next day (July 8) noting that the regression has been fixed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [XMPPwocky](user?id=XMPPwocky) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20388329)   | [parent](#20388099) [–]  Dangling domains happen all the time. As long as the main one that's actually used is still controlled by the org, others can quite easily slip through the cracks, not renewed while still present in the codebase. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Renevith](user?id=Renevith) [on July 9, 2019](item?id=20389073)   | [root](#20388099) | [parent](#20388329) [–]  Indeed! It's not even a hypothetical in this case. According to the article, Zoom was just 5 days away from letting one of the domains expire when the author told them. | | --- | --- | --- | | |
