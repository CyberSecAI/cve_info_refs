VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13929

An authenticated remote attacker with network access to port 1434/tcp of SIMATIC IT UADM could po-
tentially recover a password that can be used to gain read and write access to the related TeamCenter
station.

The security vulnerability could be exploited only if the attacker is authenticated. No user interaction
is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability
compromises the conﬁdentiality of the targeted system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
