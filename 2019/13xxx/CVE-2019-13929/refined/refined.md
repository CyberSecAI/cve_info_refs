- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SIMATIC IT UADM product encrypts a password using a predictable encryption key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary vulnerability is the use of a predictable encryption key for password storage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can recover the password, potentially gaining read and write access to the associated TeamCenter station. This compromises the confidentiality of the targeted system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, requiring network access to port 1434/tcp of the SIMATIC IT UADM software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have network access to the specified port.
