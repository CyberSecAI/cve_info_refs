Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13356:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to replace the `bdcore.dll` file located in `%programdata%\TotalDefense\Consumer\ISS\9\bd\TDUpdate2` with a malicious payload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unprotected file replacement: The software does not properly protect the `bdcore.dll` file from being overwritten by an attacker. This allows for the replacement of a legitimate DLL with a malicious one.
- Insecure DLL loading: The `AMRT.exe` service loads the replaced `bdcore.dll` without proper verification, leading to the execution of arbitrary code when the service is started or the system is rebooted.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. This could allow the attacker to:
- Gain full control over the system.
- Install malware, spyware, or other malicious software.
- Steal sensitive information.
- Modify system configurations.
- Disrupt system operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is file system manipulation. An attacker needs write access to the `%programdata%\TotalDefense\Consumer\ISS\9\bd\TDUpdate2` directory.
- The attacker then replaces the legitimate `bdcore.dll` file with a malicious version.
- The malicious code will be executed when either the system is rebooted or the `AMRT.exe` service is restarted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have write access to the `%programdata%\TotalDefense\Consumer\ISS\9\bd\TDUpdate2` directory which requires local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to either trigger a system reboot or restart the `AMRT.exe` service.
- The attacker needs to create a malicious `bdcore.dll` file containing the desired payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The GitHub content also mentions a similar vulnerability (CVE-2019-13355) related to `dotnetproxy.exe`.
- The GitHub content indicates that other components in the `%programdata%\TotalDefense\` directory may also be vulnerable, due to updates running with SYSTEM privileges. This information expands on the official CVE description and indicates potentially wider impact.
