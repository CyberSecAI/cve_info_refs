| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1725437#c0)  Stan King    2019-06-30 15:56:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1586026](attachment.cgi?id=1586026 "First 500 lines of dirmngr.log, debug level set to advanced.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1586026&action=edit "First 500 lines of dirmngr.log, debug level set to advanced.") First 500 lines of dirmngr.log, debug level set to advanced.  Description of problem:  I observed an unusual amount of network traffic, and traced it to a dirmngr process.  It's receiving a 503 service unavailable error, and endlessly retries the operation, multiple times per second.  I couldn't find fixes related to this in the release notes at <https://gnupg.org/download/release_notes.html>, nor did I find any similar bug reports on the Redhat Bugzilla.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  gnupg2-2.2.13-1.fc29.x86_64  How reproducible:  I'm not sure what triggers the execution of dirmngr.  The system was unattended when it happened this morning.  However, when it's running, it's generally affected by this.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. wait until dirmngr starts running 2. 3.  Actual results: Network traffic of about 10KB/second down, 5KB/second up, attempting to connect to <https://keys.fedoraproject.org:443/> but receiving error 503 service unavailable each time.  Expected results: I'm unfamiliar with the function of dirmngr, but presumably this will keep it from doing its regular job.   Additional info:  I'm attaching the first 500 lines from dirmngr.log, with debug level set to advanced.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1725437#c1)  Tomas Mraz    2019-07-01 08:00:04 UTC  ``` Do you have the keys.fedoraproject.org specified in .gnupg/dirmngr.conf?  In general I would recommend filling a bug in the upstream issue tracker at <https://dev.gnupg.org/> as that would speed up the investigation and fix. Unless I am able to reproduce the problem locally I would be just a messenger.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1725437#c2)  Stan King    2019-07-01 11:18:21 UTC  ``` Tomas,  I do not specify keys in .gnupg/dirmngr.conf.  It's using the default value.  keys.fedoraproject.org is resolving to CNAME keys01.fedoraproject.org., A 140.211.169.207, which is the host returning error 503.  The whois command reports this IP range belongs to Network for Education and Research in Oregon (NERO), Eugene, OR.  Contact information is provided there also.  Aside from that element of the fedoraproject.org infrastructure providing an error code, the second problem is that dirmngr immediately retrying the operation that's doomed to fail, rather than delaying or trying another keys host.  The CNAME of keys01.fedoraproject.org makes me think there was an intention to also have keys02, keys03, etc. and rotate among them as is done with pool.ntp.org, but that was not done.  keys02.fedoraproject.org resolves to another IP within the same range as keys01.  There is no keys03.fedoraproject.org.  It seems strange that there's a dependency on a single IP range within the state of Oregon, given the international user base of Fedora.  My logfile indicates that it's receiving commands from an instance of /usr/bin/gpg2 that seems to have been started by thunderbird, in the middle of the night.  It is possible to run it manually from the command line.  Just type "dirmngr", and after producing some output ending in "OK Dirmngr 2.2.13 at your service", it will await commands.  The two commands you need to reproduce the behavior are  KEYSERVER --clear hkps://keys.fedoraproject.org:443  and  KS_GET -- 0x8657980D9AB51E50  after which you should see the effects of its retry loop.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1725437#c3)  Tomas Mraz    2019-07-01 16:20:47 UTC  ``` OK, I've created the upstream issue:  <https://dev.gnupg.org/T4600>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1725437#c4)  Stan King    2019-07-02 00:14:50 UTC  ``` Thank you, Tomas.  I'm sure those who use dirmngr will appreciate it.  Will you let the server continue to generate 503 until the software is fixed?  Otherwise, how will we know if the problem is repaired?  Do you have a test server than can provide error 503 on demand?  Again, thank you for reporting this problem upstream.  I'm just looking forward to verifying it when it comes downstream.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1725437#c5)  Tomas Mraz    2019-07-02 07:28:10 UTC  ``` Unfortunately I do not manage the broken keyserver.  I suppose the gnupg upstream will test the fix appropriately.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1725437#c6)  Todd Zullinger    2019-07-13 16:36:37 UTC  ``` It looks like the dirmngr issue was fixed in the recently released gnupg-2.2.17.  As far as keys.fedoraproject.org, it seems likely that the service will be discontinued, so anyone who has configured it in either gpg.conf or dirmngr.conf will need to adjust their configurations.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=17#c0)  thunderball    1998-11-10 06:14:02 UTC  ``` I've copied base and RPMS directory to \RedHat\ on a FAT16/FAT32 Partition (I've tried both). During installation: After entering the path where to find the installation files and the Partition - the install prog claims it does not find the file install3.tr. The problem is that the install prog does not search in \RedHat\base but in /tmp/rhmask/../RedHat/base (or a little bit different). This is not too severe, but after that the install prog does not find the directories for installation. Thus an installation is not possible.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=17#c1)  eth1    1998-11-17 01:36:59 UTC  ``` Same problem down here.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=17#c2)  Jack A. Bashor    2003-08-01 15:35:35 UTC  ``` I have been trying to update my Red Hat Linux 8 with the Red Hat Network, and keep getting this message.  Is there any way that this can be fixed?  Just to let you know, I am running a dual hard drive configuration.  On the first hard drive, I have Microsoft Windows 98 SE, and on the second hard drive, I have Red Hat Linux 8.  I recently had to rebuild both systems due to a WinPoEt software difficulty with Win98 SE.  I have installed Red Hat Linux before, done the Red Hat Network, and never had any troubles like this.  Just the other day when I tried to update the Red Hat Linux 8 through the Up2Date, I had another related problem.  I usually check all when I do the update.  I got an error that it was having troubles with the Canna server.  So, I didn't check the boxes for the Canna server today, and got this error 17.     ``` |  |

## Background

[OpenPGP](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.openpgp.org%2Fabout%2F) is a non-proprietary protocol for signing and encrypting email communication using public key cryptography. Based on the original PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software, the OpenPGP protocol defines standard formats for encrypted messages, signatures, and certificates for exchanging public keys. There are several open source implementations of OpenPGP, including GnuPG which is shipped with Red Hat products.

Key servers are used to facilitate the distribution and discovery of public certificates.Users can search the key server by a variety of different criteria to discover public certificates which claim to belong to the desired user. The key server network does not attest to the accuracy of the information, that's left for each user to ascertain according to their own criteria. [SKS](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fsks-keyservers.net%2F) is one such implementation of key server which is widely used for distribution of public certificates.

Once a user has verified a certificate really and truly belongs to the person in question, they can optionally affix an affidavit to the certificate attesting that they have reason to believe the certificate really belongs to the user in question. This is known as signing the public certificate.

## Vulnerability

The [SKS key server network](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fbitbucket.org%2Fskskeyserver%2Fsks-keyserver%2Fwiki%2FHome) is susceptible to attacks as a consequence of its write-only design. As discussed above, certificates can be signed by users. These signatures are stored on the key server and are never deleted even if the certificate is revoked.

The OpenPGP specification puts no limitation on how many signatures can be attached to a certificate. The key server network handles certificates with up to about 150,000 signatures.

The vulnerability lies in the inability of the GnuPG client to handle certificates which have a large number of signatures. Certificates maliciously signed by a large number of attackers are called spammed or poisoned certificates and the resultant attack is known as a certificate spamming attack.

When an attempt is made to import or verify such a certificate (via the key server), it results in a denial of service attack against the local per-user GnuPG instance and it is rendered unusable.

In June 2019, attackers deployed a certificate spamming attack against two high-profile contributors in the OpenPGP community. Poisoned certificates are already present on the SKS key server network. The attackers may have poisoned other certificate on the network also.

This attack cannot be mitigated by the SKS key server network in any reasonable time period. It is unlikely to be mitigated by the OpenPGP Working Group in any reasonable time period. Future releases of OpenPGP software will likely have some sort of mitigation, but there is no time frame.

## Impact

### Users of GnuPG software

Users of GnuPG who import only locally created certificates or those created within their infrastructure and later use them for verification are not affected by this flaw. Unless the keys are refreshed from the public key server, the GnuPG installation is not exposed to his flaw. Users are advised to disable key servers in their GnuPG configuration file. Detailed instructions are available in the “Mitigation” section below.

### Disabling refreshing keys for users of Enigmail extension in Thunderbird

“As of Enigmail 2.0, public keys are automatically refreshed at irregular intervals. You can [disable this feature via the Thunderbird "Config Editor"](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enigmail.net%2Findex.php%2Fen%2Fuser-manual%2Fhandbook-faq). Open the Thunderbird Preferences → Advanced Tab → Config Editor. Then search for `extensions.enigmail.keyRefreshOn` and set the value to `false`.”

### Package signing

GnuPG is often used to verify downloaded packages for Linux distributions. If someone were to poison a vendor's public certificate and upload it to the key server network, the next time a system administrator refreshed their keyring from the key server network the vendor's now-poisoned certificate would be downloaded. At that point upgrades become impossible because the authenticity of downloaded packages cannot be verified. However Red Hat products, however, are not affected by this attack vector.

Red Hat ships public keys (which can be used to [verify the integrity of its signed packages](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/security_guide/sect-security_guide-updating_packages-verifying_signed_packages)) as `RPM-GPG-KEY-*` files in the `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg` directory via the `redhat-release-*` package. Though the [keys](https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key) are also hosted on key servers and the Red Hat website, we do not expect the customers to install these keys or use them for verification from our website.

Further, GPG keys used by RPM for package verification are not stored in the default location (`~/.gnupg`) but are directly imported in the RPM database present in `/usr/lib/rpm`. Similarly package management software like `yum` and `dnf`, store their imported public keys in the RPM database as well. [These keys are available to users as `gpg-pubkey*` rpm packages.](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/deployment_guide/s1-check-rpm-sig)

### Container Images

Container image signature verification is not enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, however Red Hat container images delivered from registry.redhat.io and registry.access.redhat.com are signed by the same GnuPG key as Red Hat packages. [Container image signature verification can be enabled.](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3116561)

Though container image signatures, like package signatures, are verified with GnuPG, signature verification is not impacted by this issue as the `~/.gnupg` store location is not used.

Container image verification can also be enabled by the same mechanism for images from quay.io. However, not all Red Hat container images on quay.io are currently signed.

## Mitigations

As per upstream: High-risk users should stop using the key server network immediately.

1. Open `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` in a text editor. Ensure there is no line starting with key server. If there is, remove it.
2. Open `~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf` in a text editor. Add the line `keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org` to the end of it.

keys.openpgp.org is a new experimental key server which is not part of the key server network and has some features which make it resistant to this attack. It is not a drop-in replacement: it has some limitations (for instance, its search functionality is sharply constrained). However, once you make this change you will be able to run gpg --refresh-keys with confidence.

For installations which are currently rendered unusable by this attack, the following repair method is advised:

1. If you know which certificate is likely poisoned, try deleting it. Once the installation becomes usable again, you can acquire a new unpoisoned copy of the certificate and re-import it.
2. If you do not know which certificate is poisoned, the best option is to get a list of all your certificate IDs, delete your keyrings completely (`rm -rf ~/.gnupg/` then reinstall private and public keys, or restore from backup), and rebuild from scratch using known-good copies of the public certificates.

## Frequently asked questions

Q: I use GnuPG for signing and verifying artifacts in my organization, am I affected?

A: No, Unless you import or refresh keys from the public SKS key servers, you are not impacted.

Q: Will I be vulnerable to attack if I attempt to verify the integrity of Red Hat packages using GnuPG?

A: No, as described in the section above, [Red Hat public keys](https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key), which can be used for verification are distributed as an RPM package with the distribution. You do not have to use the key servers for verification.

Q: When will a patch be available for this issue?

A: There is no time frame. This is really a flaw in the OpenGPG protocol and GnuPG is only implementing the protocol. Additionally the SKS key server code has not seen significant changes for a long time. Future releases of OpenPGP software will likely have some sort of mitigation, but there is no time frame.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-28a3675529
2019-08-06 01:54:44.691958
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : gnupg2
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 2.2.17
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <http://www.gnupg.org/>
Summary : Utility for secure communication and data storage
Description :
GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can
be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes
an advanced key management facility and is compliant with the proposed
OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440 and the S/MIME
standard as described by several RFCs.

GnuPG 2.0 is a newer version of GnuPG with additional support for
S/MIME. It has a different design philosophy that splits
functionality up into several modules. The S/MIME and smartcard functionality
is provided by the gnupg2-smime package.

2019-07-18 17:55:37.801187
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : gnupg2
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 2.2.17
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://www.gnupg.org/>
Summary : Utility for secure communication and data storage
Description :
GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can
be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes
an advanced key management facility and is compliant with the proposed
OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440 and the S/MIME
standard as described by several RFCs.

GnuPG 2.0 is a newer version of GnuPG with additional support for
S/MIME. It has a different design philosophy that splits
functionality up into several modules. The S/MIME and smartcard functionality
is provided by the gnupg2-smime package.

SKS Keyserver Network Under Attack

# SKS Keyserver Network Under Attack

*This work is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/).*

## Terminological Note

"OpenPGP" refers to the OpenPGP protocol, in much the same way that HTML refers to the protocol that specifies how to write a web page. "GnuPG", "SequoiaPGP", "OpenPGP.js", and others are implementations of the OpenPGP protocol in the same way that Mozilla Firefox, Google Chromium, and Microsoft Edge refer to software packages that process HTML data.

## Who am I?

Robert J. Hansen <rjh@sixdemonbag.org>. I maintain the GnuPG FAQ and unofficially hold the position of crisis communicator. This is not an official statement of the GnuPG project, but does come from someone with commit access to the GnuPG git repo.

## Executive Summary

In the last week of June 2019 unknown actors deployed a certificate spamming attack against two high-profile contributors in the OpenPGP community (Robert J. Hansen and Daniel Kahn Gillmor, better known in the community as "rjh" and "dkg"). This attack exploited a defect in the OpenPGP protocol itself in order to "poison" rjh and dkg's OpenPGP certificates. Anyone who attempts to import a poisoned certificate into a vulnerable OpenPGP installation will very likely break their installation in hard-to-debug ways. Poisoned certificates are already on the SKS keyserver network. There is no reason to believe the attacker will stop at just poisoning two certificates. Further, given the ease of the attack and the highly publicized success of the attack, it is prudent to believe other certificates will soon be poisoned.

This attack cannot be mitigated by the SKS keyserver network in any reasonable time period. It is unlikely to be mitigated by the OpenPGP Working Group in any reasonable time period. Future releases of OpenPGP software will likely have some sort of mitigation, but there is no time frame. The best mitigation that can be applied at present is simple: stop retrieving data from the SKS keyserver network.

## How Keyservers Work

When Phil Zimmermann first developed PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") in the early 1990s there was a clear chicken and egg problem. Public key cryptography could revolutionize communications but required individuals possess each other's public keys. Over time terminology has shifted: now public key cryptography is mostly called "asymmetric cryptography" and public keys are more often called "public certificates", but the chicken-and-egg problem remains. To communicate privately, each party must have a small piece of public data with which to bootstrap a private communication channel.

Special software was written to facilitate the discovery and distribution of public certificates. Called "keyserver software", it can be thought of as analogous to a telephone directory. Users can search the keyserver by a variety of different criteria to discover public certificates which claim to belong to the desired user. The keyserver network does not attest to the accuracy of the information, however: that's left for each user to ascertain according to their own criteria.

Once a user has verified a certificate really and truly belongs to the person in question, they can affix an affidavit to the certificate attesting that they have reason to believe the certificate really belongs to the user in question.

For instance: John Hawley (john@example.org) and I (rjh@example.org) are good friends in real life. We have sat down face-to-face and confirmed certificates. I know with complete certainty a specific public certificate belongs to him; he knows with complete certainty a different one belongs to me. John also knows H. Peter Anvin (hpa@example.org) and has done the same with him. If I need to communicate privately with Peter, I can look him up in the keyserver. Whichever certificate bears an attestation by John, I can trust really belongs to Peter.

## Keyserver Design Goals

In the early 1990s we were concerned repressive regimes would attempt to force keyserver operators to replace certificates with different ones of the government's choosing. (I speak from firsthand experience. I've been involved in the PGP community since 1992. I was there for these discussions.) We made a quick decision that keyservers would never, ever, ever, delete information. Keyservers could add information to existing certificates but could never, ever, ever, delete either a certificate or information about a certificate.

To meet this goal, we started running an international network of keyservers. Keyservers around the world would regularly communicate with each other to compare directories. If a government forced a keyserver operator to delete or modify a certificate, that would be discovered in the comparison step. The maimed keyserver would update itself with the content in the good keyserver's directory. This was a simple and effective solution to the problem of government censorship.

In the early 1990s this design seemed sound. It is not sound in 2019. We've known it has problems for well over a decade.

## Why Hasn't It Been Fixed?

There are powerful technical and social factors inhibiting further keyserver development.

* **The software is Byzantine.** The standard keyserver software is called SKS, for "Synchronizing Key Server". A bright fellow named Yaron Minsky devised a brilliant algorithm that could do reconciliations very quickly. It became the keystone of his Ph.D thesis, and he wrote SKS originally as a proof of concept of his idea. It's written in an unusual programming language called OCaml, and in a fairly idiosyncratic dialect of it at that. This is of course no problem for a proof of concept meant to support a Ph.D thesis, but for software that's deployed in the field it makes maintenance quite difficult. Not only do we need to be bright enough to understand an algorithm that's literally someone's Ph.D thesis, but we need expertise in obscure programming languages and strange programming customs.
* **The software is unmaintained.** Due to the above, there is literally no one in the keyserver community who feels qualified to do a serious overhaul on the codebase.
* **Changing a design goal is not the same as fixing a bug.** The design goal of the keyserver network is "baked into" essentially every part of the infrastructure. This isn't a case where there's a bug that's inhibiting the keyserver network from functioning correctly. Bugs are generally speaking fairly easy to fix once you know where the problem is. Changing design goals often requires an overhaul of such magnitude it may be better to just start over with a fresh sheet of paper.
* **There is no centralized authority in the keyserver network.** The lack of centralized authority was a feature, not a bug. If there is no keyserver that controls the others, there is no single point of failure for a government to go after. On the other hand it also means that even after the software is overhauled and/or rewritten, each keyserver operator has to commit to making the upgrade and stomping out the difficulties that inevitably arise when new software is fielded. The confederated nature of the keyserver network makes changing the design goals even harder than it would normally be—and rest assured, it would normally be very hard!

## The Vulnerabilities

The keyserver network is susceptible to a variety of attacks as a consequence of its write-only design. The keyserver network can be thought of as an extremely large, extremely reliable, extremely censorship-resistant distributed filesystem which anyone can write to.

Imagine if Dropbox allowed any Tom, Dick, or Harry to not only put information in your public Dropbox folder, but made it impossible for you to delete it. How would everyone from spammers to child pornographers abuse this?

Many of the same attacks are possible on the keyserver network. We have known about these vulnerabilities for well over a decade. Fixing the keyserver network is, however, problematic for the reasons listed above.

In order to limit the scope of this document a detailed breakdown of only one such vulnerability will be presented (see below).

### The Certificate Spamming Attack

Consider public certificates. In order to make them easier to use, they have a list of attestations: statements from other people, represented by their own public certificates, that this certificate really belongs to the individual in question. In my example from before, John Hawley attested to H. Peter Anvin's certificate. When I looked for H. Peter Anvin's certificate I checked all the certificates which claimed to belong to him and selected the one John attested as being really his.

These attestations — what we call *certificate signatures* — can be made by anyone for any purpose. And once made, they never go away. Ever. Even when a certificate signature gets revoked the original remains on the certificate: all that happens is a second signature is affixed saying "don't trust the previous one I made".

The OpenPGP specification puts no limitation on how many signatures can be attached to a certificate. The keyserver network handles certificates with up to about 150,000 signatures.

GnuPG, on the other hand … doesn't. Any time GnuPG has to deal with such a spammed certificate, GnuPG grinds to a halt. It doesn't stop, per se, but it gets wedged for so long it is for all intents and purposes completely unusable.

My public certificate as found on the keyserver network now has just short of 150,000 signatures on it.

Further, pay attention to that phrase *any time GnuPG has to deal with such a spammed certificate.* If John were to ask GnuPG to verify my signature on H. Peter Anvin's certificate, GnuPG would attempt to comply and in the course of business would have to deal with my now-spammed certificate.

## The Consequences

We've known for a decade this attack is possible. It's now here and it's devastating. There are a few major takeaways and all of them are bad.

* **If you fetch a poisoned certificate from the keyserver network, you will break your GnuPG installation.**
* **Poisoned certificates cannot be deleted from the keyserver network.**
* **The number of deliberately poisoned certificates, currently at only a few, will only rise over time.**
* **We do not know whether the attackers are intent on poisoning other certificates.**
* **We do not even know the scope of the damage.**

That last one requires some explanation. *Any certificate may be poisoned at any time, and is unlikely to be discovered until it breaks an OpenPGP installation.*

The number one use of OpenPGP today is to verify downloaded packages for Linux-based operating systems, usually using a software tool called GnuPG. If someone were to poison a vendor's public certificate and upload it to the keyserver network, the next time a system administrator refreshed their keyring from the keyserver network the vendor's now-poisoned certificate would be downloaded. At that point upgrades become impossible because the authenticity of downloaded packages cannot be verified. Even downloading the vendor's certificate and re-importing it would be of no use, because GnuPG would choke trying to import the new certificate. It is not hard to imagine how motivated adversaries could employ this against a Linux-based computer network.

## Mitigations

At present I (speaking only for myself) do not believe the global keyserver network is salvageable. **High-risk users should stop using the keyserver network immediately.**

Users who are confident editing their GnuPG configuration files should follow the following process:

1. Open `gpg.conf` in a text editor. Ensure there is no line starting with `keyserver`. If there is, remove it.
2. Open `dirmngr.conf` in a text editor. Add the line `keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org` to the end of it.

`keys.openpgp.org` is a new experimental keyserver which is not part of the keyserver network and has some features which make it resistant to this sort of attack. It is not a drop-in replacement: it has some limitations (for instance, its search functionality is sharply constrained). However, once you make this change you will be able to run `gpg --refresh-keys` with confidence.

## Repairs

If you know which certificate is likely poisoned, try deleting it: this normally goes pretty quickly. If your OpenPGP installation becomes usable again, congratulations. Acquire a new unpoisoned copy of the certificate and import that.

If you don't know which certificate is poisoned, your best bet is to get a list of all your certificate IDs, delete your keyrings completely, and rebuild from scratch using known-good copies of the public certificates.

## A Personal Postscript

dkg wrote a [blog post](https://dkg.fifthhorseman.net/blog/openpgp-certificate-flooding.html) about this. He sums up my feelings pretty well, so I'm going to quote him liberally with only a trivial correction.

> I've spent a significant amount of time over the years trying to push the ecosystem into a more responsible posture with respect to OpenPGP certificates, and have clearly not been as successful at it or as fast as I wanted to be. Complex ecosystems can take time to move.
>
> To have my own certificate directly spammed in this way felt surprisingly personal, as though someone was trying to attack or punish me, specifically. I can't know whether that's actually the case, of course, nor do I really want to. And the fact that Robert J. Hansen's certificate was also spammed makes me feel a little less like a singular or unique target, but I also don't feel particularly proud of feeling relieved that someone else is also being "punished" in addition to me.
>
> But this report wouldn't be complete if I didn't mention that I've felt disheartened and demotivated by this situation. I'm a stubborn person, and I'm trying to make the best of the situation by being constructive about at least documenting the places that are most severely broken by this. But I've also found myself tempted to walk away from this ecosystem entirely because of this incident. I don't want to be too dramatic about this, but whoever did this basically experimented on me (and Rob) directly, and it's a pretty shitty thing to do.
>
> If you're reading this, and you set this off, and you selected me specifically because of my role in the OpenPGP ecosystem, or because I wrote the abuse-resistant-keystore draft, or because I'm part of the Autocrypt project, then you should know that I care about making this stuff work for people. If you'd reached out to me to describe what you were planning to do, we could have done all of the above bug reporting and triage using demonstration certificates, and worked on it together. I would have happily helped. I still might! But because of the way this was done, I'm not feeling particularly happy right now. I hope that someone is, somewhere.

To which I'd like to add: I have never in my adult life wished violence on any human being. I have witnessed too much of it and its barbaric effects, stood by the graves of too many people cut down too young. I do not hate you and I do not wish any harm to befall you.

But if you get hit by a bus while crossing the street, I'll tell the driver everyone deserves a mulligan once in a while.

You fool. You absolute, unmitigated, unadulterated, complete and utter, fool.

Peace to everyone — including you, you son of a bitch.

*— Rob*

Why do you think it is not compatible? And you can search for keys there:

<https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=>

or put the key server URL in your config file and then GnuPG uses this server for fetching.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks [@SAC001](https://github.com/SAC001); would you mind please filing that *in Hockeypuck's bug tracker*? <https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck/issues>

And I just want to be clear that my point was *not* anything like "maybe Hockeypuck doesn't have these problems", but rather "maybe people who want to fix the problems but are intimidated by OCaml can be less intimidated by Go. :)

It looks like [@cmars](https://github.com/cmars) has been steadily hacking away on Hockeypuck; help in whatever way you can--one of those ways is to file bugs in the actual bugtracker so that developers can find them easily ;)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks for the bug report [@SAC001](https://github.com/SAC001). Now fixed in master; query responses will only contain uid, uat and subkey packets that have valid primary key self-signatures.

There is also a configuration option for only including self-signed packets in responses. This excludes WoT use cases, but it can protect clients like apt which are primarily concerned with signature verification.

This will go out in the next release. I'll put in a request to upgrade keyserver.ubuntu.com after we're back from the holiday break.

I've released [Hockeypuck 2.1.0](https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck/releases/tag/2.1.0), which contains several new features that may be useful to mitigate these type of attacks. See the release link for details, but in a nutshell, I've added:

* Configurable key length and packet size limits, with sensible defaults.
* Configurable blacklist of primary key fingerprints.
* Authenticated key management. This adds a couple of extra endpoints which allow a key owner to replace or delete their key, authenticated by self-signing the armored key in the request.

Blacklists and auth key management may also be of interest to keyserver operators subject to GDPR-related requests.

Is there an official list of current malicious keys abusing the resources of PGP key servers?

```
  "2790943722612cf8d9c2db9213de25eed1bb5151",

```

There is a partial list Hockeypuck changelog but do you know some more? It would be useful for PGP key server operators.

I feel like the proper solution will be authenticating signatures from both parties.

So I guess it is time to just change the rules. In order for a signature to be considered valid, its key fingerprint must be present in a self-signed part of the "key" it signs. All the keys should be edited, but it is not an issue, they should be periodically re-signed anyway, and if an author doesn't care.

It would solve not only the issue of spamming but also the issue of unilateral violation of rules of signing another's "key"s.

I mean there are lot of people ready to sign random keys in the internet without proper identity and key checks (such as meeting personally, verifying identity of a person using natural face and voice biometrics built into every human being, then verifying integrity of the key, and only after that signing) because they say "but I trust them!" (which is an absolute violation of "key"-signing semantics).

In that case, please make sure to have some "short and clear instructions" in an easy-to-find place. Else especially novice users will be overstretched (TBH, I use PGP for about 20 years now and couldn't tell out of my head).

As an alternative, wouldn't if be sufficient if the key owner self-uploads the key (IIRC that was the only way to get it in/updated anyway, requiring approval via a mail sent to the key's main email address)? Or is that "too weak" (as some "unwanted sigs" might sneak in unnoticed)?

Of course no. I often upload to keys3rvers keys that don't belong to me, just for convenience of retrieval.

Oh, then I must remember something wrongly. I thought with openpgp.net only the owner could upload (and needs to click the confirmation link sent by mail). Apologies then.

I don't use `openpgp.net` so IDK how the things are going on there, my favorite keyservers are `pgp.mit.edu` and `keyserver.ubuntu.com` and at least on them and on the most of other keyservers using the same software one can upload public "keys" of other people.

Giof, the SKS keyservers are essentially dead now, you can use <https://keys.openpgp.org/> instead to upload your public key and share.

[@GioF](https://github.com/GioF) Consider taking a look at <https://keys.mailvelope.com/>, because there you have full control over your pub key(s) and it keeps your WoT signatures, compared to <https://keys.openpgp.org>. Or If you like to use modern encryption tools forget PGP and switch, like a lot of people already did to modern 'age' <https://github.com/FiloSottile/age>. The author of age is a well known cryptographer and security lead for Golang and has on Twitler more followers than gnupg.org on Twitler... HTH!

[@KOLANICH](https://github.com/KOLANICH) that is perfectly fine if you still like to use GnuPG, I only mentioned age because many GnuPG users already switched to age. That should IMHO tell us something, you know. I also could have mentioned modern sequoia-pgp instead, but that is OpenPGP too and has a slightly higher learning curve, for beginners, than age. See also Mr. Zimmermann's Testimonial. <https://sequoia-pgp.org/> Anyways, I will stay now on topic and hope that [@GioF](https://github.com/GioF) has found the right keyserver solution for himself and his communication partners!

sure. But then they won't be deleted. That'd be silly as then nobody could learn about their revocation. The certifications could probably be stripped, though.

For me, GnuPG's traditional Web of Trust approach is dead. I have written my thoughts including a "new" way to realise Web of Trust:

The missing feature of deletion is the reason for hosting [my own keyserver](https://github.com/duxsco/gpg-keyserver). I created my keypair with `ed25519` for primary and `nistp521` for subkeys. But, after figuring out that the `nistp521` authentication subkey cannot be used for `ssh` I decided to use `nistp384` for that subkey. Using something like `hkps://keys.openpgp.org` would make the obsolete `nistp521` auth subkey linger around although that subkey is not needed for communication with others. This is not something that I wish for, because I want to keep my pubkey slim as long as it makes sense.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1141093#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-07-11 07:21:06 UTC  ``` recently there were attacks against the public keyserver network, where a large number of signatures could be added to keys.  This in turn would massively slow down gpg when it processes these keys.  <https://lwn.net/Articles/792366/>  GPG 2.2.17 was now released to fix this, we should backport the relevant changes. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1141093#c2)  Pedro Monreal Gonzalez   2019-07-12 08:56:07 UTC  ``` Update to version 2.2.17, submitted to Factory: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/714630> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1141093#c3)  Pedro Monreal Gonzalez   2019-07-15 14:52:03 UTC  ``` From Upstream [0], mitigations/repairs.  1) MITIGATIONS: High-risk users should stop using the keyserver network immediately.  Users who are confident editing their GnuPG configuration files should follow the following process:   *) Open gpg.conf in a text editor. Ensure there is no line starting with keyserver. If there is, remove it.   *) Open dirmngr.conf in a text editor. Add the line keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org to the end of it.  keys.openpgp.org is a new experimental keyserver which is not part of the keyserver network and has some features which make it resistant to this sort of attack. It is not a drop-in replacement: it has some limitations (for instance, its search functionality is sharply constrained). However, once you make this change you will be able to run gpg --refresh-keys with confidence.  2) REPAIRS: If you know which certificate is likely poisoned, try deleting it: this normally goes pretty quickly. If your OpenPGP installation becomes usable again, congratulations. Acquire a new unpoisoned copy of the certificate and import that.  If you don't know which certificate is poisoned, your best bet is to get a list of all your certificate IDs, delete your keyrings completely, and rebuild from scratch using known-good copies of the public certificates.

After first boot, run xterm and ulimit -a: core is unlimited. Create some ssh key, reboot. After second boot, run xterm and ulimit -a: core is unlimited. Create some gpg key with 'gpg --quick-genkey string', reboot. After third boot, run xterm and ulimit -a: core is ... zero.  Because "ulimit -c" is zero (via gpg-agent), no crashes are recorded as core files and the info about a crash is lost.  What I found so far via debug kernel: lightdm calls bash, which does 'exec ssh-agent', which does 'exec gpg-agent', which disables ulimit -c, then does 'exec xinitrc'. xfce4-session starts with disabled core, and all apps it launches inherit that setting. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c1)  Olaf Hering   2019-02-08 22:11:10 UTC  ``` Different VM, same bug with KDE. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c2)  Neil Rickert   2019-02-09 03:03:00 UTC  ``` I can confirm this.  However, it needs some clarity.  You reported this for Leap 42.3, but your description says 15.0.  In any case, I am seeing the problem with Leap 42.3, with Leap 15.0 and with Tumbleweed 20190201.  In 42.3, coredumpsize is 0 in KDE.  But if I rename ".gnupg" to some other name,  then logout and login, coredumpsize is now unlimited.  In Tumbleweed, coredumpsize is 0 in KDE, but is unlimited in Gnome-Wayland.  In 15.0, where I tested most extensively: coredumpsize is zero in KDE, XFCE and Gnome-X11.  But it is unlimited in Plasma-Wayland, in Gnome-Wayland and it is unlimited in XFCE if there is no ".gnupg".  If I ssh to root@localhost, then coredumpsize is unlimited there.  I'll note that for 15.0 and for Tumbleweed, gpg-agent is not started in a Wayland session startup, but it is started in an X11 session startup.  This suggests that for 15.0 and Tumbleweed, the simplest solution would be to skip starting gpg-agent which is not really needed for the version of gpg used there.  For 42.3 that won't work, as the older gpg version does require that gpg-agent be started at session startup. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c3)  Vítězslav Čížek   2019-02-11 08:29:39 UTC  ``` Seems caused by gpg, reassigning to Pedro. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c4)  Olaf Hering   2019-02-11 08:41:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to Neil Rickert from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c2)) > I can confirm this.  Wayland does not use the X11 init scripts, so it is likely unaffected.   The bug in gpg-agent is present since a decade.  There is a code path that does exec(). This path must not fiddle with ulimit. There is another code path that does fork(). This path is free to tweak ulimit for the livetime of this process. There is another code path that checks if gpg-agent is running. This path most likely does not need to care about ulimit.  I suggest to move disable_core_dumps() into the child. Up to this point no security relevant things happend AFAICS.  Fix neededed for SLE12 and inherited codebases. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c5)  Pedro Monreal Gonzalez   2019-02-25 22:44:43 UTC  ``` Olaf, thanks for the patch. I'll ask upstream if this could have security implications like ptrace a child process, see for example <https://dev.gnupg.org/T1509>. IIRC, this is not possible now. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c6)  Pedro Monreal Gonzalez   2019-04-29 15:23:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 803837](attachment.cgi?id=803837&action=diff "Patch to move disable_core_dumps() to the child process") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=803837&action=edit "Patch to move disable_core_dumps() to the child process") Patch to move disable_core_dumps() to the child process ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c7)  Pedro Monreal Gonzalez   2019-04-29 15:29:33 UTC  ``` Bug reported upstream: <https://dev.gnupg.org/T4473> ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c8)  Olaf Hering   2019-05-06 14:33:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Pedro Monreal Gonzalez from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c7)) > Bug reported upstream: > <https://dev.gnupg.org/T4473>  We have to fix it either way for our own purpose. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c9)  Vítězslav Čížek   2019-05-06 14:58:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Pedro Monreal Gonzalez from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c7)) > Bug reported upstream: > <https://dev.gnupg.org/T4473>  Upstream resolution: Closed, Wontfix  "Since 2.1 the standard use of gpg-agent is to have it started on demand by the components which require it.

Okay, that won't work for Leap 42.3, but that's near EOL.  For 15.0, 15.1 and Tumbleweed, there is no need to start gpg-agent.  It will be started by the first user command that needs it.  And the X11 session will no longer be a descendant process of ssh-agent, so the ulimit problem won't arise. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c11)  Pedro Monreal Gonzalez   2019-05-07 09:31:20 UTC  ``` Adding Werner in CC: @Werner, could the solution in [comment#10](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c10) be applied on xdm side?

IMHO both can be done ... gpg-agent should never ever modify (u)limits as this is not its mission.  For xdm simply change in    /etc/X11/xdm/scripts/10-gpg-agent  the line    : ${usegpg:=yes}  to    : ${usegpg:=no}  then it is on the system administrator to change this maybe by export usegpg=yes ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c13)  Pedro Monreal Gonzalez   2019-07-11 10:04:39 UTC  ``` @Werner, could you add the modification from [comment#12](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c12) in xdm so the gpg-agent would be started on demand.

The bug in the gpg2 side is fixed by applying the patch.  Another question is, and maybe it should go into a different bug, if we want to modify the X11 scripts (since gpg2 version 2.1, i.e. from SLE-15) so that the gpg-agent is not started by the scripts but only when required. I would be in favor of doing this.  I have tested the modification from [comment#12](show_bug.cgi?id=1124847#c12) in TW and SLE-15-SP1, for gnome desktop, gdm and xdm only and it all works fine there. Not sure if I should test this for all desktops since it would be similar. But you are right, all display managers and desktops should be tested.

```
Hello!

We are pleased to announce the availability of a new GnuPG release:
version 2.2.17.  This is maintenance release to mitigate the effects of
the denial-of-service attacks on the keyserver network.  See below for a
list changes.

About GnuPG
===========

The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG, GPG) is a complete and free implementation
of the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards.

GnuPG allows to encrypt and sign data and communication, features a
versatile key management system as well as access modules for public key
directories.  GnuPG itself is a command line tool with features for easy
integration with other applications.  The separate library GPGME provides
a uniform API to use the GnuPG engine by software written in common
programming languages.  A wealth of frontend applications and libraries
making use of GnuPG are available.  As an universal crypto engine GnuPG
provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell in addition to OpenPGP.

GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom).  It can
be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.

Noteworthy changes in version 2.2.17
====================================

  * gpg: Ignore all key-signatures received from keyservers.  This
    change is required to mitigate a DoS due to keys flooded with
    faked key-signatures.  The old behaviour can be achieved by adding
      keyserver-options no-self-sigs-only,no-import-clean
    to your gpg.conf.  [#4607]

  * gpg: If an imported keyblocks is too large to be stored in the
    keybox (pubring.kbx) do not error out but fallback to an import
    using the options "self-sigs-only,import-clean".  [#4591]

  * gpg: New command --locate-external-key which can be used to
    refresh keys from the Web Key Directory or via other methods
    configured with --auto-key-locate.

  * gpg: New import option "self-sigs-only".

  * gpg: In --auto-key-retrieve prefer WKD over keyservers.  [#4595]

  * dirmngr: Support the "openpgpkey" subdomain feature from
    draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-07. [#4590].

  * dirmngr: Add an exception for the "openpgpkey" subdomain to the
    CSRF protection.  [#4603]

  * dirmngr: Fix endless loop due to http errors 503 and 504.  [#4600]

  * dirmngr: Fix TLS bug during redirection of HKP requests.  [#4566]

  * gpgconf: Fix a race condition when killing components.  [#4577]

  Release-info: <https://dev.gnupg.org/T4606>

Getting the Software
====================

Please follow the instructions found at <<https://gnupg.org/download/>> or
read on:

GnuPG 2.2.17 may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or
direct from its primary FTP server.  The list of mirrors can be found at
<<https://gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html>>.  Note that GnuPG is not
available at ftp.gnu.org.

The GnuPG source code compressed using BZIP2 and its OpenPGP signature
are available here:

 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.2.17.tar.bz2> (6560k)
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.2.17.tar.bz2.sig>

An installer for Windows without any graphical frontend except for a
very minimal Pinentry tool is available here:

 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.2.17_20190709.exe> (4185k)
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.2.17_20190709.exe.sig>

The source used to build the Windows installer can be found in the same
directory with a ".tar.xz" suffix.

A new version of Gpg4win incluing this version of GnuPG will be released
in a few days.

Checking the Integrity
======================

In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of
the following ways:

 * If you already have a version of GnuPG installed, you can simply
   verify the supplied signature.  For example to verify the signature
   of the file gnupg-2.2.17.tar.bz2 you would use this command:

     gpg --verify gnupg-2.2.17.tar.bz2.sig gnupg-2.2.17.tar.bz2

   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
   You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
   made by one or more of the release signing keys.  Make sure that
   this is a valid key, either by matching the shown fingerprint
   against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by
   checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys.
   See the end of this mail for information on the signing keys.

 * If you are not able to use an existing version of GnuPG, you have
   to verify the SHA-1 checksum.  On Unix systems the command to do
   this is either "sha1sum" or "shasum".  Assuming you downloaded the
   file gnupg-2.2.17.tar.bz2, you run the command like this:

     sha1sum gnupg-2.2.17.tar.bz2

   and check that the output matches the next line:

12c1cee8871c03f0315fc8f27876364b75c95b12  gnupg-2.2.17.tar.bz2
533deef5939fcd6506be650731dea4a9d18f9df8  gnupg-w32-2.2.17_20190709.tar.xz
82abfbc79d1a99b27f25ba92fe878cad07a31532  gnupg-w32-2.2.17_20190709.exe

Internationalization
====================

This version of GnuPG has support for 26 languages with Chinese
(traditional and simplified), Czech, French, German, Japanese,
Norwegian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian being almost completely
translated.

Documentation and Support
=========================

If you used GnuPG in the past you should read the description of
changes and new features at doc/whats-new-in-2.1.txt or online at

  <https://gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html>

The file gnupg.info has the complete reference manual of the system.
Separate man pages are included as well but they miss some of the
details available only in thee manual.  The manual is also available
online at

  <https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/>

or can be downloaded as PDF at

  <https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg.pdf> .

You may also want to search the GnuPG mailing list archives or ask on
the gnupg-users mailing list for advise on how to solve problems.  Most
of the new features are around for several years and thus enough public
experience is available.  <https://wiki.gnupg.org> has user contributed
information around GnuPG and relate software.

In case of build problems specific to this release please first check
<https://dev.gnupg.org/T4509> for updated information.

Please consult the archive of the gnupg-users mailing list before
reporting a bug: <<https://gnupg.org/documentation/mailing-lists.html>>.
We suggest to send bug reports for a new release to this list in favor
of filing a bug at <<https://bugs.gnupg.org>>.  If you need commercial
support check out <<https://gnupg.org/service.html>>.

If you are a developer and you need a certain feature for your project,
please do not hesitate to bring it to the gnupg-devel mailing list for
discussion.

Thanks
======

Maintenance and development of GnuPG is mostly financed by donations.
The GnuPG project currently employs two full-time developers and one
contractor.  They all work exclusively on GnuPG and closely related
software like Libgcrypt, GPGME and Gpg4win.

We have to thank all the people who helped the GnuPG project, be it
testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, administering the
servers, spreading the word, and answering questions on the mailing
lists.

Many thanks to our numerous financial supporters, both corporate and
individuals.  Without you it would not be possible to keep GnuPG in a
good shape and to address all the small and larger requests made by our
users.  Thanks.

Happy hacking,

   Your GnuPG hackers

# CVE-2019-13050

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-13045.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-13057.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-13050 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13050)

#### Description

Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.
