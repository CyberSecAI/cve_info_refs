  "CVE-2019-13509": {
    "description": "Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log leading to information disclosure.",

    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Disclosure of sensitive information (secrets) that could be present in the docker configuration or environment variables",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered if the docker daemon is running in debug mode.",
          "An attacker would require access to the logs where the secrets were written."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs access to the debug logs written by docker, which are typically only visible to an administrator or high-privileged user.",

       "additional_information":"The vulnerability is triggered when docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that includes (non-external) secrets, or by other API users who resend the secret. Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x before 18.03.1-ee-10) are affected"
