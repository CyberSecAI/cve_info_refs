Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
MobaXterm is your ultimate toolbox for remote computing. In a single Windows application, it provides loads of functions that
are tailored for programmers, webmasters, IT administrators and pretty much all users who need to handle their remote jobs in
a more simple fashion. MobaXterm provides all the important remote network tools (SSH, X11, RDP, VNC, FTP, MOSH, ...) and Unix
commands (bash, ls, cat, sed, grep, awk, rsync,) to Windows desktop, in a single portable exe file which works out of the box.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
The URI handler of MobaXterm (mobaxterm:) has an argument injection vulnerability that allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands when the user visits a specially crafted URL. Based on the available command line arguments
of the software, one can simply inject `-exec` to execute arbitrary commands. The additional arguments `-hideterm` and
`-exitwhendone` in the payload allow the attack become less visible. Successful exploitation of the arbitrary code
execution vulnerability results in unauthorized execution of malicious code on the affected web-server system.
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerability could be triggered by visiting a specially crafted URL.
To reproduce the vulnerability, one could simply create a .url file or open the URL using certain Windows Apps like Outlook for Windows.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The manufacturer is preparing a update for the future versions 12.0 or 12.1 by putting warnings at each execution of MobaXterm,
when it is started using an URL.
Please update the software and version as soon as the update becomes available on the webpage of the product manufacturer.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote code execution vulnerability in the mobdaxterm application is estimated as high.
