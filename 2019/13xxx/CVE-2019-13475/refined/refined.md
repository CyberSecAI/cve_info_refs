Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13475:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the URI handler of MobaXterm (`mobaxterm:`). This handler has an argument injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Argument injection:** The `mobaxterm:` URI handler does not properly sanitize or validate arguments, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary command-line arguments.
- **Unrestricted command execution:** By injecting the `-exec` argument, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Unauthorized execution of malicious code:** Malicious code can be executed without the user's explicit consent or knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted URL:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted URL that uses the `mobaxterm:` URI scheme and includes malicious command-line arguments.
- **File:** The crafted URL can be embedded in a `.url` file or opened through applications like Outlook for Windows

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to be on the local network or have direct access to the victim's machine.
- **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL using the `mobaxterm:` scheme with injected arguments.
- **Low user interaction:** The victim needs to visit the malicious URL through a browser or by opening a crafted file for the exploit to work.

**Additional details from the provided text:**
- The vulnerability was found in MobaXterm v11.1.
- The attacker can use `-hideterm` and `-exitwhendone` arguments to hide the terminal window, making the attack less visible.
- A PoC video is provided demonstrating the exploitation.
- The vendor is planning to address the issue in future versions (12.0 or 12.1) by adding warnings when MobaXterm is launched using a URL.
