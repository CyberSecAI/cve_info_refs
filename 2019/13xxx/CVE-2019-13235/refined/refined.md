Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13235:

**CVE Description:** Reflected XSS in the Alkacon OpenCms Apollo Template 10.5.4 and 10.5.5 Login form.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header in the login form of Alkacon OpenCms Apollo Template versions 10.5.4 and 10.5.5. The application reflects the header value without proper sanitization, which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the reflected XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the login page via the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they access the crafted login page.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  A successful XSS attack could lead to the theft of session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
*  **Phishing/Credential Theft:** The attacker could modify the login form to steal credentials or redirect users to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the login page, setting the `X-Forwarded-For` header to a payload containing a JavaScript injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable OpenCms instance.
*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to modify HTTP headers, specifically `X-Forwarded-For`.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content gives the following example of an attack request:
```
GET /login/index.html?requestedResource=&name=Editor&password=editor&action=login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-Forwarded-For: .<img src=. onerror=alert('XSS')>.test.ninja
```
This request injects the following payload in the X-Forwarded-For header:
```
.<img src=. onerror=alert('XSS')>.test.ninja
```
This payload will cause the javascript `alert('XSS')` to run in the victim's browser when it loads the login page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically present in the login form of the Alkacon OpenCms Apollo Template.
*   The provided information confirms that versions 10.5.4 and 10.5.5 are affected.
*   The issue is resolved in the 11.x branch of OpenCms.
