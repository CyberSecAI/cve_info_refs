  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ssi binary on the TRENDNet TEW-827DRU H/W 2.0 F/W 2.04 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to the insecure use of `strcpy` to copy the `QUERY_STRING` environment variable to a fixed-size buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Insecure use of `strcpy`",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution can be achieved on the affected device. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the device, such as opening a reverse shell.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to any valid cgi, txt, asp, or js file on the device with an overly long query string"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to authenticate and can exploit the vulnerability locally or remotely if remote administration is enabled. The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable firmware and how to craft the malicious query string to achieve RCE. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device."
