```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The affected system stores password hashes in the /etc/passwd file, which is accessible to unauthenticated users, and stores plaintext passwords in the /usr/local/root/flash/etc/sysconfig/userspwd, accessible through a web interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Credential Disclosure, Privilege Escalation, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, Use of Hard-coded Credentials",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with knowledge of one user account password can gain knowledge of other accounts' passwords and possibly escalate their privileges. Successful exploitation can disrupt the primary operations of the affected component, shut down cooling to other equipment, and allow changes to the temperature set point.",
  "Attack vectors": "Accessing the /etc/passwd file, the /usr/local/root/flash/etc/sysconfig/userspwd file or the web interface showing the passwords in plaintext.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with knowledge of at least one user account password can exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely with low skill level"
