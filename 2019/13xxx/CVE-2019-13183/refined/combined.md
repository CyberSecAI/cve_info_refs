# Security Policy

##

## Versions

Due to the nature of our project - being open source - we have decided to patch only the latest major release (currently v1.x) for security vulnerabilities.

## How to disclose

Please use [our website](https://flarum.org/contact/security) for security issues that affect our project. If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please disclose it via our website. You can also disclose security issues by mailing security@flarum.org.

## What we do

Any submitted security issue will be checked thoroughly by our development team. A fix for the issue and a transparent information on GitHub about the issue existing will be released. You can view any previously identified issues on our [GitHub Security Page](https://github.com/flarum/.github/security). New major versions of Flarum will also receive a security audit to verify our efforts on providing a secure application.

* Special characters such as `%` and `_` could return incorrect results ([ee3640e](https://github.com/flarum/core/commit/ee3640e1605ff67fef4b3d5cd0596f14a6ae73c9))

### Removed

* `php flarum install --defaults` - this was meant to be used in our old development VM ([44c9109](https://github.com/flarum/core/commit/44c91099cd77138bb5fc29f14fb1e81a9781272d))
* Obsolete `id` attributes in JSON-API responses ([ecc3b5e](https://github.com/flarum/core/commit/ecc3b5e2271f8d9b38d52cd54476d86995dbe32e) and [7a44086](https://github.com/flarum/core/commit/7a44086bf3a0e3ba907dceb13d07ac695eca05ea))

# CSRF attack prevention was skipped

## Package

composer

flarum/core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=0.1.0-beta.8

## Patched versions

0.1.0-beta.9

## Description

We accidentally disabled CSRF protection at some point in the past.

### Impact

CSRF attacks allow attackers to execute actions on behalf of other users. To do so, they either need another (so-called XSS) vulnerability inside Flarum, or trick a logged-in user into visiting a site they control, from which they can make the user's browser send malicious requests to Flarum on behalf of the user.

One of our team members successfully reproduced the report, coming up with an attack that would let attackers manipulate any admin setting they want - provided they could attack a user with admin privileges.

### Patches

Please upgrade to 0.1.0-beta.9 immediately to re-enable CSRF protection.

### Workarounds

*None*

### References

[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site\_Request\_Forgery\_(CSRF)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29)

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to @CuPcakeN1njA for the responsible and detailed disclosure!

Reminder: If you notice or learn about vulnerabilities in Flarum's code, please report them responsibly [according to our security policy](https://github.com/flarum/core/security/policy).

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2019-13183

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

# Flarum 0.1.0-beta.9 Released

### luceos

**Today marks the release of **Flarum 0.1.0-beta.9** code named "Leafy Seadragon".**

## About our code names

For quite a while we've been considering adopting code names for our releases. An Australian theme has long been the prime candidate, being the founding grounds of Flarum. With [@Toby](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/Toby) [having left](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/20590-farewell-and-what-s-next-for-flarum) the team, we found this theme to be the only viable option as a candid homage.

![Leafy Seadragon](http://opencage.info/pics/files/800_10085.jpg)

## The release

This release contains several improvements and **fixes a vulnerability** under the hood. Changes include an upgrade to Laravel components and a full rewrite of how the installer is hooked into the rest of Flarum, amongst others.

**We urge you to upgrade as soon as possible.** More details on the vulnerability can be found [in this advisory](https://github.com/flarum/core/security/advisories/GHSA-3wjh-93gr-chh6).

Some of the changes we would like to emphasize:

* 🏷️ Tags can now have an icon. Thank you [@NomisCZ](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/NomisCZ).
* ✉️ More mail drivers can now be configured in the admin interface.
* ☑️ Checking MariaDB version and MySQL version now works decently during installation.
* ⚠️ CSRF attacks allowed attackers to execute actions on behalf of other users. Thanks to [@CuPcakeN1njA](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/CuPcakeN1njA) for reporting this.
* 💫 OAuth providers no longer worked.
* 📈 Event posts were included in user post statistics counts.
* ✏️ Admins could not reset user passwords.

These are just some of the highlights of beta 9. There are tons of other minor features, polish, bug fixes, and performance improvements – see the [full changelog](https://github.com/flarum/core/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for all the nitty-gritty!

## For Developers

As we're now using Illuminate (Laravel) 5.7, some of your code might no longer be working like it used to be. Verify whether anything changed in the Laravel documentation ([1](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/upgrade#upgrade-5.6.0), [2](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/upgrade#upgrade-5.7.0)) and make sure to bump your constraint in case you've used an Illuminate dependency in your composer.json.

## Upgrading

> Before you run the upgrade, make sure to create a backup of your `public/assets` directory, your `composer.json` and your database!

Go into your admin area mail settings and make sure that your "mail driver" field has its value in lowercase. So use `smtp` instead of `SMTP`.

Alright, time to upgrade! These commands may take a few minutes to run – especially if you're running a big forum. Sit tight!

> In case you are not on any of the beta 8 releases, you will have to follow [the instructions inside the beta 8 announcement](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/17745). Make sure to disable all 3rd party extensions before doing the upgrade.

```
composer update --prefer-dist --no-dev -o --with-all-dependencies
php flarum migrate
php flarum cache:clear
```

Now close your eyes 😌, cross your fingers 🤞, and reload your sparkly new Beta 9 forum.

Start a new discussion in the [Support tag](https://discuss.flarum.org/t/support) if you're having trouble at any point, disable any third party extensions that aren't compatible with this version. If the problem persists – we're here to help! Make sure to mention the Flarum version you are on or the output of `php flarum info`.

## Thank You

I'd like to wrap up by thanking everyone who has made this release possible. Thank you...

To all of the people who have contributed code to this release: especially [@Toby](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/Toby), [@Franz](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/Franz), [@datitisev](https://discuss.flarum.org/u/datitisev), and anyone else who I've missed.

> [luceos](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/20606-flarum-0-1-0-beta-9-released/1) Admins could not reset user passwords.

I think it is not a good idea. Many people forget their passwords, and they forget which e-mail they used to register.

[luceos](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/20606-flarum-0-1-0-beta-9-released/1) One thing we forgot to add to the release announcement (edited now):

> * ✉️ More mail drivers can now be configured in the admin interface.

[Star](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/20606-flarum-0-1-0-beta-9-released/18) I think you misunderstood. That was a bugfix. Admins can now reset user passwords again.

>
> 🏷️ Tags can now have an icon.

[lion](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/20606-flarum-0-1-0-beta-9-released/82) It's in the first post, this is now a feature in the Tags extension that comes with Flarum.

### Shahiem

Thank you guys for your hard work! 🙂

### Staszek

Thank you very much🙂 Now time to make upgrade at last (from beta7)🙂 I suppose I just have to do what is written in beta7->8 upgrade, but at the end instead of running upgrade commands from beta7->8:

```
composer update
php flarum migrate
php flarum cache:clear
```

I should run upgrade commands from here:

```
composer update --prefer-dist --no-dev -o --with-all-dependencies
php flarum migrate
php flarum cache:clear
```

And it will upgrade straight to beta9?

[Staszek](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/20606-flarum-0-1-0-beta-9-released/6) Either will work, the second version is slightly optimized.

[Star](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/20606-flarum-0-1-0-beta-9-released/18) what you quoted was [the issue](https://github.com/flarum/core/issues/1686), Beta 9 fixes this problem so admins can reset passwords again.
