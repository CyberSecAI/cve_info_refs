Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-13239 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** Stored XSS in GLPI versions prior to 9.4.3 due to insufficient sanitization of the profile picture name.
*   **Root Cause:** The GLPI application does not properly sanitize the filename of user-uploaded profile pictures. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the `picture` field of the user profile.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization on the `picture` field when updating user preferences. The `getURLForPicture` function does not sanitize the string, allowing insertion of HTML.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can upload a file with a malicious filename (containing XSS payload) as their profile picture.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**

    *   **Stored XSS:**  The malicious payload is stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the affected user's profile.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with low privileges can inject JavaScript that, when executed by an administrator, can modify the user's profile to grant them Super-Admin privileges.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a valid GLPI user with the ability to update their profile picture. The attacker needs an administrator to view their profile for the XSS to be triggered.
*   **Affected Versions:** All GLPI versions 9.x prior to 9.4.3.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to GLPI version 9.4.3 or later. The provided commit addresses this by setting the picture field to 'NULL' to avoid XSS. Additionally, `Html::cleanInputText` is applied to the `$picture` variable in the `getURLForPicture` and `getThumbnailURLForPicture` methods.
