Honeywell released new firmware Version 1.04.15 and recommends affected users [contact Honeywell customer support](https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/contact) to resolve the issue.

Honeywell recommends users take the following defensive measures:

* Upgrade firmware of vulnerable instruments with help from Honeywell after sales support.
* Allow only trusted persons to physically access the target system, including devices that have connection to the system through the Ethernet port.
* If possible, isolate target system from the Internet or create additional layers of defense to target system from the Internet by placing the affected hardware behind a firewall or into a DMZ.
* If remote connections to the network are required, consider using a VPN or other means to ensure secure remote connections into the network where the device is located.

For additional information refer to the [Honeywell Product Security Bulletin 2018-HBT](https://buildings.honeywell.com.cn/-/media/hbtcn/products-technologies/4security-access-control-system/2win-pak-access-control-solutions/pro3000/sb2018ipak2-eng-pdf.pdf).

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).
