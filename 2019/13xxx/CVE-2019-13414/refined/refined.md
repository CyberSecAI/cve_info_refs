The provided content relates to CVE-2019-13414.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in the Rencontre WordPress plugin. Specifically, several parameters within the `$_GET` and `$_POST` arrays were not being sanitized before being used in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, some input was not being properly sanitized before outputting in HTML context, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The plugin was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of unsanitized `$_GET` parameters in SQL queries.
- XSS: The plugin was vulnerable to XSS due to the use of unsanitized `$_GET` and `$_POST` parameters when outputting HTML content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: An attacker could potentially manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database, modify data, or even gain unauthorized access to the server.
- XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which could be executed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL Injection: Attackers could inject malicious SQL code through crafted URL parameters, such as `id`, `zsex`, `homo`, `ageMin`, `ageMax`, `pays`, `region`, `obj`, `profilQS1`, `profilQS2`, `relation`, `ville`, `gps`, `km`, `pseudo`, `sex`, `z2sex`, `tailleMin`, `tailleMax`, `poidsMin`, `poidsMax`, `mot`, `photo`, `profil`, `astro`, in `inc/rencontre_widget.php`.
- XSS: Attackers could inject malicious scripts through crafted URL parameters such as `id`, `zsex`, `homo`, `ageMin`, `ageMax`, `pays`, `region`, `obj`, `profilQS1`, `profilQS2`, `relation`, `ville`, `gps`, `km`, `pseudo`, `sex`, `z2sex`, `tailleMin`, `tailleMax`, `poidsMin`, `poidsMax`, `mot`, `photo`, `profil`, `astro` in `inc/rencontre_widget.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.
- No specific authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities, meaning they could be exploited by unauthenticated users as well.

**Additional notes:**
- The identified vulnerabilities were addressed in version 3.1.3 of the plugin.
- The patch included sanitizing inputs with functions like `intval()`, `strip_tags()` and `preg_replace()`.
- The vulnerability was reported by N Admavidhya.
