        "summary": "CVE-2019-13916 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the BLE stack of certain Infineon (formerly Cypress) devices. It can be triggered by sending a crafted BLE packet with a PDU larger than 252 bytes. This leads to heap corruption, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability affects devices like CYW20735, CYW20719 and CYW20819, and the Raspberry Pi 3 with a BCM2835. The fix for this vulnerability is in BT SDK2.4 for some devices and BT-SDK2.5 for others."
