Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-13069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions on the `ProgramData` subfolder used by Extenua SilverShield 6.x. This lack of proper security allows unauthorized modification of the application's configuration database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the inadequate access control on the `ProgramData` folder and its contents. This allows a local attacker to modify the `SilverShield.config.sqlite` database file.
*   **Configuration Database Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to directly modify the SQLite database which stores user credentials and settings for the SilverShield application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** By injecting a new user with administrative privileges into the database, an attacker can then log in to the SilverShield SSH service using this new account.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to complete control of the system as the attacker gains SYSTEM level privileges by logging into the SSH service as the injected user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attack involves modifying files within the vulnerable folder of the application's installation.
*   **SSH Service Abuse:**  The attacker leverages the application's SSH service to gain SYSTEM level access after manipulating the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker requires at least local user access to the target Windows system.
*   **File System Access:** Ability to read/write to the `ProgramData` directory where SilverShield stores its configuration files.
*   **Metasploit Framework (Optional):** While a Metasploit module is available, the vulnerability could be exploited without it, as demonstrated in the provided PDF.
