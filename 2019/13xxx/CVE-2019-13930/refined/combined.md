VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13930

The web interface could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is
tricked into accessing a malicious link.

Successful exploitation requires user interaction by a legitimate user, who must be authenticated to
the web interface. A successful attack could allow an attacker to trigger actions via the web interface
that the legitimate user is allowed to perform. This could allow the attacker to read or modify contents
of the web application.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13931

The web interface could allow for an an attacker to craft the input in a form that is not expected,
causing the application to behave in unexpected ways for legitimate users.

Successful exploitation requires for an attacker to be authenticated to the web interface. A successful
attack could cause the application to have unexpected behavior. This could allow the attacker to
modify contents of the web application.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Page (Basic XSS)

Vulnerability CVE-2019-13932

The web application requests could be manipulated, causing the the application to behave in unex-
pected ways for legitimate users.

Successful exploitation does not require for an attacker to be authenticated. A successful attack could
allow the import of scripts or generation of malicious links. This could allow the attacker to read or
modify contents of the web application.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
