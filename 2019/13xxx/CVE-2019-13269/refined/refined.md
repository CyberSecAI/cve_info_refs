The provided content discusses cross-router covert channels that allow data leakage between host and guest networks, even when logical network isolation is in place. It describes several covert channels and analyzes their effectiveness. CVE-2019-13269 is assigned to one of the discovered vulnerabilities.

The identified vulnerabilities/weaknesses include:

*   **DHCP Direct:** Improper handling of DHCP packets with unusual IP headers, leading to DHCP NAK messages being erroneously sent to both host and guest networks. Data can be encoded in the 32-bit Transaction ID field.
*   **IGMP Direct:** Joining and leaving an IGMP group on one network triggers an IGMP Membership Query packet to be sent to both networks. Data is transferred within the Group IP field.
*   **ARP Direct:** ARP requests are forwarded between host and guest networks. The sender can issue an ARP request to an arbitrary computer on the network, using either the lower 8 bits of the IP address, or the entire 32 bits as the data payload.
*   **Timing Covert Channels:** Exploitation of shared router resources (CPU time, network buffers) through various techniques.

    *   **SSH:** Initiating SSH key exchange to increase CPU load.
    *   **CSRF:** Using Cross-Site Request Forgery to load the router's webpage in an iframe, increasing CPU load.
    *   **DHCP Timing:** Measuring the time it takes for the router to respond to DHCP Request packets.
    *   **ARP Timing:** Repeatedly querying the router for its MAC address using ARP who-has packets.
    *   **ICMP:** Repeatedly sending ICMP echo requests to the router and measuring the response time.

The impact of exploitation includes:

*   **Information Leakage:** Sensitive data can be exfiltrated from a secured network to a less secured network or the internet.
*   **Control Bypass:** Attackers can send commands to compromised devices on a secured network from a less secured network.

Attack vectors include:

*   Specially crafted network traffic that exploits vulnerabilities in DHCP, IGMP, or ARP protocols.
*   Timing-based attacks that exploit shared router resources by generating high CPU load or network traffic.

Required attacker capabilities/position:

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious agent installed on at least one of the separated network segments.
*   For some timing attacks, the attacker can coerce a victim on the host network into viewing an attacker-controlled webpage using an embedded iframe element.
