Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **MGOS Forced Browsing:** The root cause is a vulnerability in the MGOS (presumably, the operating system of Sierra Wireless devices) that allows a locally connected, unauthenticated user to read log files containing sensitive system information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the ability to access sensitive information from log files without proper authentication. This allows unauthorized exposure of potentially critical system details.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability allows access without needing to authenticate, indicating a failure to enforce necessary access control restrictions on log files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exploitation of the vulnerability leads to a breach of confidentiality, as attackers can gain access to sensitive system information contained in log files.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The information obtained could potentially be used to plan further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker needs to be physically or directly connected to the vulnerable device, via Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the local network of the affected device (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
*   **No User Credentials Needed:** No prior authentication or valid credentials are required for the exploitation.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The advisory assigns a CVSS v3.0 base score of 8.8 (High) with vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.

**Affected Products:**

*   oMG2000 running MGOS 3.15.1 or earlier.
*   MG90 running MGOS 4.2.1 or earlier.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to MGOS 3.15.2 or MGOS 4.3.
*   Restrict access to the Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces of the device if an upgrade is not possible.
