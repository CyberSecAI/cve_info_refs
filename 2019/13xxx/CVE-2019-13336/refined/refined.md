Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The web server on the dbell smart doorbell does not properly validate user input for parameters in the URL, specifically the username (`loginuse`) and password (`loginpass`) parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication by providing arbitrary values for username and password parameters in the URL. The server executes the requested functions regardless of the provided credentials.
*   **Remote Command Execution:**  Due to the lack of authentication and input validation, any function exposed through the web server via `.cgi` files can be executed remotely. This includes functions for unlocking a connected door lock via the relay switch.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** Although not directly related to the main vulnerability, the presence of hardcoded credentials in the doorbell's source code highlights poor security practices. These were discovered during the security analysis but were not required to exploit the main issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Door Unlocking:**  Attackers can remotely unlock doors connected to the doorbell's relay switch.
*   **Remote Control:** Any other `.cgi` functions on the webserver can be executed remotely, leading to further potential attacks.
*   **Privacy and Security Breach:** Users' privacy is breached and their physical security is compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests containing the vulnerable URL to the doorbell's web server on port 81. Specifically, the attacker would send a request to `openlock.cgi` with arbitrary values for `loginuse` and `loginpass`.
*   **Network Accessibility:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability locally on the network or remotely if the doorbell is exposed to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the doorbell or have network access to the device if exposed on the internet.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the doorbell.
*   **No Special Authentication Knowledge:** The attacker does not need valid credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to dbell on July 4th, 2019, but they initially responded poorly, denying that the vulnerability exists and threatening legal action against the researcher.
*   The vendor was given a 90-day disclosure deadline.
*   The vulnerability was not patched by the vendor.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the dbell smart doorbell.

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, as it includes specific information about the attack vector, the vulnerable function (`openlock.cgi`), and the vendor's response.
