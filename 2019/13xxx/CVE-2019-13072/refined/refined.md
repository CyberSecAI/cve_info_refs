Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper input sanitization in the 'Name' field on the 'Filters' page of ZoneMinder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the "Filters" page.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks on users.

**Attack vectors:**
- An authenticated user can inject a JavaScript payload into the 'Name' field when creating or editing a filter.
- The injected script executes when other users or the attacker themselves view the 'Filters' page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account and be authenticated to the ZoneMinder application.
- They need to be able to access the 'Filters' page to create a new filter.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in ZoneMinder version 1.32.3, specifically when installed from the Ubuntu 16.04 PPA.
- The provided `curl` command demonstrates how to inject the payload using a POST request.
- The injected script persists through browser sessions due to the stored nature of the XSS.
- The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary javascript code, which will later be executed once a user returns to the Filters page.
