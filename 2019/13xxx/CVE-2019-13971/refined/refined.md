The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OTCMS version V3.81.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `apiRun.php` file not properly sanitizing the `mode` parameter before outputting it to the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: The `mode` parameter is directly reflected in the HTML output without any sanitization or encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page.
- This can lead to a variety of attacks, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `mode` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into visiting the link, or embed it in a malicious site or email.
