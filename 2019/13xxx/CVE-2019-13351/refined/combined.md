Since alsa-plugins >= 1.1.7 now enables the ALSA jack plugin by default with 50-jack.conf, I've been seeing sporadic crashes in Kodi when the sound devices get reenumerated for a udev event. I traced this down to a double close on the audio engine thread concurrent with a close on the udev thread which asserts on EBADF in libudev causing the crash.

An strace pointed to the double close occuring in posix/JackSocket.cpp:139 and posix/JackSocket.cpp:158.

To fix this, reset fSocket to -1 after closing on an error to prevent a double close later.

| Hi Filipe, As a follow up, this is a security bug as a double close can cause unintended information disclosure in multithreaded programs depending upon timing of the 2nd close. Ubuntu has requested a CVE be filed: <https://cveform.mitre.org/> so I am filing one. From looking through the git history, this vulnerability looks like it's been around since 2009 in version 1.9.1. … -Joe On Wed, Jun 19, 2019 at 6:40 AM Filipe Coelho \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> wrote: Merged [#480](https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/pull/480) <[#480](https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/pull/480)> into develop. — You are receiving this because you authored the thread.

## Description

![@yasij](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3516160?v=4&size=48)[yasij](https://github.com/yasij)opened [on Jun 10, 2019](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/16258#issue-454419230)
## Bug report

### Describe the bug

Here is a clear and concise description of what the problem is:

Kodi crashes sporadically when I turn on my TV and receiver since I upgraded to Ubuntu 19.04. There is a double close somewhere on the ActiveAE thread which is racing against the PeripBusUSBUdev. libudev has an assert when close returns EBADF. When I turn the TV on, it triggers udev\_enumerate\_scan\_devices. This has been difficult to debug due to the sporadic nature of the race condition. I've straced kodi-x11 with close() calls, but if I add openat to the list, it disturbs the timing enough that I haven't been able to reproduce with that strace attached. It happens at least 50% of the time turning my TV on with no strace attached.

## Expected Behavior

Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen:

Kodi should not crash sporadically when turning on my TV.

## Actual Behavior

Kodi crashes sporadically when turning on my TV.

## Possible Fix

### To Reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Boot machine with auto login to kodi. I'm using ALSA HDMI audio. The EDID is fixed.
2. Turn my TV on. This triggers the receiver on via CEC.
3. Kodi crashes.

### Debuglog

The debuglog can be found here:

(Debugging is not on for this log because it disturbs the timing enough to mess with the race condition, and makes it hard to reproduce):

Stack strace from the core dump, it asserts inside libudev due to the double close on the other thread:
