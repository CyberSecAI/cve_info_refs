{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper permissions on a Windows registry key allow any user in the 'Users' group to modify the entries within the key.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "DLL side-loading vulnerability",
    "Insecure registry key permissions",
        "A service, 'WavesSysSvc', is configured to load DLLs based on registry entries.",
    "Lack of proper validation of DLL paths loaded by the service."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to SYSTEM level access, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Modifying the registry key entry 'ExternalModule' within the 'General' key located at 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Waves Audio\\MaxxAudio'",
    "Replacing the DLL path with a malicious DLL path."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any user within the 'Users' group can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must also have the ability to place the malicious DLL onto the system."
