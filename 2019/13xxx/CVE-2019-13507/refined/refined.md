{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection (SQLi)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to database compromise such as data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In some cases, it could also lead to full system compromise by exploiting stored procedures or database system vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `news_det.php` file, specifically manipulating the `cod` parameter with SQL injection payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No specific attacker position is required."
