Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13734:

**Description:** CVE-2019-13734 is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the SQLite library as used in Google Chrome before version 79.0.3945.79. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption through a crafted HTML page.

**Root Cause:** Out of bounds write in SQLite's fts3 component, specifically related to shadow table corruption detection.

**Vulnerability:** The weakness stems from how SQLite's full-text search 3 (fts3) module handles shadow tables, potentially leading to corruption if these tables are mishandled.

**Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML page.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to heap corruption, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the sandbox of the Chrome browser. It can cause SQLite to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Affected Products:**
*   Google Chrome versions prior to 79.0.3945.79.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
