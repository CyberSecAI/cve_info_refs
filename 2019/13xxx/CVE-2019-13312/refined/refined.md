Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-13312:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `block_cmp` function in `ffmpeg/libavcodec/zmbvenc.c` triggered by a null pointer dereference or undefined behavior in `libavformat/nutenc.c`.
- Specifically, the issue stems from incorrect handling of a buffer offset in the zmbv encoder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A read of size 1 occurs outside the allocated buffer bounds.
- Null pointer dereference: A null pointer is passed as an argument to `memcmp`.
- Undefined behavior: Left shift of a negative value is performed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a program crash due to memory access violation.
- Denial of Service: The crash can lead to a denial of service, as the program terminates unexpectedly.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution under specific conditions. The provided information doesn't confirm this for this specific case.
- Sensitive information disclosure: The Ubuntu Security Notice mentions that an attacker could potentially use this issue to obtain sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted video file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted video file (specifically, a WebM file converted to nut format with zmbv codec).
- Input file: The `tmp.webm` file provided in the ticket is the attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious input file to the FFmpeg application.
- This could be a remote attacker if the application processes user-supplied files. The Gentoo Security Advisory suggests that the vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a regression introduced by commit `0321370601833f4ae47e8e11c44570ea4bd382a4` which added support for RGB formats to the zmbv encoder.
- The heap buffer overflow was located at `ffmpeg/libavcodec/zmbvenc.c:97:30` and triggered in the `block_cmp` function during zmbv encoding.
- The undefined behavior was found at `libavformat/nutenc.c:794:27`.
- The vulnerability affects FFmpeg versions prior to 4.2.4.
- Patches for the issues in the zmbv encoder and nut muxer were made in commits `def04022f4a7058f99e669bfd978d431d79aec18` and `e4fdeb3fcefeb98f2225f7ccded156fb175959c5` respectively.
