Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how CWP (Control Web Panel) handles session data. It allows a low-privileged user to gain root privileges by exploiting a weakness in the session management mechanism. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the ability to craft a valid session file from a testing environment and then inject this file into a target server via the `/tmp` directory, bypassing normal authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Session Handling:** CWP is vulnerable to session manipulation. It trusts session data even if it originates from an untrusted source. The application doesn't sufficiently validate or sanitize session data before using it, allowing an attacker to forge session files.
2.  **Lack of Proper Session Validation:** CWP does not implement proper checks to ensure the integrity of session data. It allows the injection of a session file created in a different environment with a valid root session.
3.  **File Upload Vulnerability:** CWP allows file uploads to the `/tmp` directory. While this directory is often used for temporary storage, CWP's failure to properly sanitize/validate uploaded files before processing them as sessions, makes this a vulnerability point.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can gain complete root access on the target system. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, read/modify files, install software, create new users, or cause a denial of service.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, the attacker has complete control over the server, which can lead to data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Session File Crafting:** The attacker first creates a session on a test environment as a root user and extracts the session cookie. The attacker then grabs the session file from the `/tmp` directory on the test server.
2.  **File Upload:**  The attacker logs into a target CWP server as a low-privileged user and uploads the crafted session file to the `/tmp` directory. This is done using a file manager, specifically via a POST request which is then intercepted and modified to change the upload destination to /tmp.
3.  **Session Injection:** The attacker navigates to the admin login page, and sets the cookie value to the name of the uploaded file and token value in the URL.
4. **Gaining root access:** Upon refreshing the browser, CWP improperly uses the attacker crafted session file and logs the attacker in as root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a CWP Instance:** The attacker needs access to a CWP installation. This could either be a local installation (for setting up the testing environment), and/or any publicly accessible CWP instance.
*   **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs access to a low-privilege user account on the target CWP server to upload files.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP POST requests, specifically those related to file uploads, in order to upload the malicious file to the /tmp directory.
*   **Ability to Manipulate Cookies:** The attacker must be able to set the session cookie value to the crafted session file.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to complete steps 6-8 quickly to avoid the application changing permissions on the injected session file. Setting up a cron job to change file permissions can assist with this.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in version `0.9.8.840`.
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Pongtorn Angsuchotmetee, Nissana Sirijirakal, and Narin Boonwasanarak.
* The vulnerability was discovered on June 30, 2019 and fixed on July 2, 2019.
