```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an incorrect assumption about the behavior of the `atoi()` function in the `mg_parse_http` function. Specifically, the code did not handle cases where the input string began with whitespace characters, which could cause `atoi()` to return an unexpected value leading to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of whitespace in input string",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption leading to a crash, which could potentially lead to other bugs.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP request with a status code that starts with whitespace characters to the `mg_parse_http` function.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable function."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "vulnerability_location": "`src/mg_http.c` in the `mg_parse_http` function",
    "patch": "A patch was implemented by checking that the first character of the status code isn't a space using the `isspace()` function before calling `atoi()`.",
    "fuzzing_tools": "libFuzzer was used to identify the vulnerability.",
    "affected_versions": "Mongoose versions 6.14 and prior are affected, and the fix is present in 6.15.",
     "contributor_note": "The vulnerability was found using a fuzzer contributed by yevgenypats and a fix was contributed by bobsayshilol"
