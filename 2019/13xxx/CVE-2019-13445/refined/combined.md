![@danielwangksu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3903579?u=3252db7fa462b76a4cb595e4b068baa141513d1d&v=4&size=48)[danielwangksu](https://github.com/danielwangksu)opened [on Jul 2, 2019](https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/1738#issue-463448919)

Potentially overflowing expression "1048576 \* S" with type "int" (32 bits, signed) is evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic, and then used in a context that expects an expression of type "uint64\_t" (64 bits, unsigned).

[ros\_comm/tools/rosbag/src/record.cpp](https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/blob/29053c4832229efa7160fb944c05e3bc82e11540/tools/rosbag/src/record.cpp#L129)

To avoid overflow, cast either "1048576" or "S" to type "uint64\_t".
