    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the user-defined redirects feature of Read the Docs, specifically with 'prefix' or 'sphinx' redirects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Open Redirect"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can create hyperlinks that appear to point to a Read the Docs domain (either *.readthedocs.io or a custom docs domain) but actually redirect users to an arbitrary, potentially malicious, external domain. This could be used for phishing or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious user-defined redirect within Read the Docs, exploiting the 'prefix' or 'sphinx' redirect functionality to redirect users to an external domain.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create or modify user-defined redirects in a Read the Docs project. This implies the attacker needs some level of authorization on the target project."
  },
  "technical_details": "The vulnerability is specific to Read the Docs versions prior to 3.5.1. It involves a flaw in how user-defined redirects (specifically 'prefix' or 'sphinx') are handled. The issue allows for the creation of hyperlinks that appear to go to a documentation domain on Read the Docs, but instead go to a different, attacker-controlled domain.",
