Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Zoom client for macOS includes a locally running web server on port 19421. This server has an undocumented API and is accessible to any website a user visits, circumventing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. This design choice allows websites to interact with the local Zoom client without the user's explicit consent, a vulnerability that Zoom implemented to avoid extra clicks when joining a meeting

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Forced Meeting Join:** A malicious website could force a user into a Zoom meeting without their permission by sending a simple GET request to the local web server.
2.  **Unauthorized Webcam Activation:** If the meeting host had the "Participants: On" video setting enabled, a user could be forced into a meeting with their video camera automatically activated without explicit consent. This could be triggered by embedding a malicious iframe in the website.
3.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly sending GET requests with invalid meeting numbers, a malicious website could cause the Zoom client to continuously request "focus" from the OS, effectively freezing the target machine (Mac only).
4.  **Automatic Re-installation:** The local web server could be used to reinstall the Zoom application without any user interaction beyond visiting a webpage, even if the user had previously uninstalled the application. It could also automatically update the zoom client.
5.  **Lack of Browser Sandbox:** The local webserver allows websites to bypass the browser's security sandbox and trigger actions outside the browser environment which is a fundamental security vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

1.  **Privacy Violation:** Users' webcams could be activated without their knowledge or consent, allowing attackers to potentially record or view them.
2.  **Disruption of Service:** Users could experience a Denial of Service, causing their systems to freeze or become unusable.
3.  **Malware Installation:** If a malicious party gained control of Zoom's update server or one of their domains and the automatic update feature was triggered, they could distribute malware through the Zoom client reinstallation.
4.  **Potential Remote Code Execution:** The article notes that if this vulnerability were combined with other vulnerabilities like the one found by Tenable, RCE would have been possible.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Websites:** A malicious website can embed the exploit code, and any user visiting that site can be impacted.
2.  **Malicious Ads:** The exploit can be embedded in online ads.
3.  **Phishing Campaigns:** The exploit can be used in phishing campaigns to lure users to malicious websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

1.  The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage or embed the malicious code within a website, ad, or other online content that a target may visit.
2.  No special network position is needed for the basic forced meeting join and camera activation vulnerability, however the Denial of Service (DOS) attack is only applicable for MacOS users.
3.  To exploit the reinstallation vulnerability to install malicious software, the attacker would need to compromise one of the domains that Zoom uses to download the updates.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was originally responsibly disclosed on March 26, 2019, with a 90-day public disclosure deadline.
*   Zoom failed to address the vulnerability adequately and quickly, initially only implementing a 'quick fix' that could be bypassed.
*   The article discusses the general insecurity of allowing websites to communicate directly with desktop applications without user consent.
*   The author recommends using a custom URI handler as a more secure method of launching the Zoom client.
*   The Zoom client versions prior to 4.4.2 are vulnerable to the Denial of Service vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability impacts users of Zoom on Mac, and potentially other white labeled products.
*   The Zoom team proposed 'signing' requests to the client, but this was found to be insufficient as it could be easily bypassed.
*   Apple silently removed the affected applications from the user's computers using MRT.
*   The article recommends that researchers report vulnerabilities in Zoom's software via the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) rather than directly to Zoom due to a negative experience with their vulnerability disclosure process.
