Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-13046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies within the `sudo` and linker behavior of ToaruOS 1.10.9. Specifically, the exploit leverages the fact that `sudo` can be tricked to execute a custom shared library. This custom library has a constructor that runs shellcode upon loading. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation or restrictions on the libraries being loaded and executed by `sudo`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unrestricted Library Loading:** The `sudo` implementation in ToaruOS 1.10.9 does not properly restrict or validate shared libraries being loaded. This allows an attacker to substitute a custom, malicious library.
2.  **Constructor Execution:** The exploit uses a shared library with a constructor function (`mehness`). The constructor automatically executes when the library is loaded, allowing arbitrary shellcode to run.
3. **Missing Input Validation:** `sudo` does not validate the supplied library, allowing it to load the malicious one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local Root Access:** The attacker gains root privileges on the target system as demonstrated by the `whoami` command switching from `local` to `root` in the shell output. This allows complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to execute the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account with the ability to execute commands via the shell.
2.  **Write Access to a Directory:** The attacker needs write access to create a shared library and store it in `/tmp`.
3.  **Basic knowledge of Shell scripting and C programming:** Required to create shell scripts and the shared object.

**Technical Details:**
* The exploit script (`kowasu-linker.sh`) compiles a C file (`/tmp/x.c`) containing shellcode into a shared library (`/tmp/libc.so`).
* The shellcode within `/tmp/x.c` is designed to execute `/bin/sh`.
* The script uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH to specify the location of the malicious shared library `/tmp/libc.so`.
* By executing `sudo mehness`, the `sudo` program loads the malicious `/tmp/libc.so`, triggering the constructor function `mehness` which then executes the shellcode.
* The `sudo` command, is used here with an arbitrary name `mehness` this is not a valid command, but due to the library path manipulation, it causes the execution of the injected code.
* The exploit overwrites a existing library `libtoaru_auth.so` with `libc.so`, forcing the `sudo` command to load the injected malicious library.
