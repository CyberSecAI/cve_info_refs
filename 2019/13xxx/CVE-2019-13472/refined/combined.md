Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
PHPWind is a forum program based on PHP and MySQL and one of the most frequently used forum programs.
It is a forum program developed by Hangzhou Detian Information Technology Co, Ltd, China. The predecessor
of PHPWind is ofstar. The source code for PHPWind can be downloaded for free, but it is not free software because the
license does not meet the definition of free software.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities has been discovered in the PhpWind v9.1.0 forum software application.
The cross site vulnerability allows remote attacker to manipulate client-side browser requests to compromise content or session data.
The cross site scripting vulnerabilities are located in the `c`, and `m` parameters of the `index,php` file. Remote attackers are
able to inject own malicious script code (exp. javascript) to hijack user session credentials or to manipulate client-side the
web-application contents in local browsers. The injection point of the vulnerabilities are the vulnerable `c` and `m` parameters.
The attack vector is located on the application-side and the request method to inject/execute is GET.
The security risk of the non-persistent cross site scripting web vulnerabilities are estimated as medium with a cvss count of 3.3.
Exploitation of the web security vulnerability requires a privileged web-application user account and only low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the client-side vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing, non-persistent
external redirects and non-persistent manipulation affected or connected module context.
Request Method(s):
[+] GET
Vulnerable File(s):
[+] index.php
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] c
[+] m
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers and local low privileged application user account with low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The issue can be fixed if proper input validation will be taken in place for the c and m parameters in the index.php file.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the cross site scripting web vulnerabilities in the phpwind web-application are estimated as medium.
