- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `c` and `m` parameters of the `index.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, non-persistent phishing, non-persistent external redirects, and manipulation of affected module context.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the vulnerable `c` and `m` parameters in `index.php` file, via GET requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Remote attacker, a low-privileged application user account, and low to medium user interaction are needed for exploitation. The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and entice a user to click it.
