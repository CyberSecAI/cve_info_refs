CVE-2019-13307
```
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **heap-based buffer overflow** in the `EvaluateImages` function within `MagickCore/statistic.c` of ImageMagick. This overflow is triggered by mishandling the number of rows during image processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer in the heap.
*   **Incorrect row calculation:** The logic responsible for managing image rows within `EvaluateImages` is flawed, leading to out-of-bounds writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service:** Exploitation can lead to a crash due to memory corruption, resulting in a denial-of-service.
*   **Potential code execution:** In some scenarios, the heap overflow might be leveraged to overwrite critical memory areas, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ImageMagick. This is considered a high impact by NVD. SUSE rates the impact of confidentiality as low, and integrity as None, while availability is still low.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted image is processed by the `EvaluateImages` function of ImageMagick.
*   **Local attack:** An attacker would need to supply a specially crafted image file for ImageMagick to process, which can be triggered when running ImageMagick on a local file or when providing remote file for processing

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to supply a malicious image to be processed by ImageMagick.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
*   User interaction is required, because a user or automated system must execute ImageMagick to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in ImageMagick version 7.0.8-50 Q16.
*   Patches have been released by SUSE and openSUSE to fix this vulnerability.
*   This issue is also present in ImageMagick6 according to the github commit included in the document.
*   The issue was reported on github, and includes a proof-of-concept command to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score varies slightly between NVD and SUSE due to different assessments of attack vector and privileges required.
*   Debian also released a fix for this issue.
*   Ubuntu also released a fix that includes CVE-2019-13307
