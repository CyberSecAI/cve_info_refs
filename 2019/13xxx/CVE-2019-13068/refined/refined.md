     "summary": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper escaping of HTML in panel drilldown links within Grafana. This allows an attacker to inject HTML tags via the title and URL fields, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or modification of data. NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of Grafana are affected, specifically NetApp E-Series Performance Analyzer, with remediation being to update to Grafana 6.2.5 or later which includes a fix for the vulnerability. Attackers require the ability to create or modify the panel drilldown links."
