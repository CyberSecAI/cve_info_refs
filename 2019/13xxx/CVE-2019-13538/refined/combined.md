**--------- End Update A Part 2 of 3 ---------**

Please visit the CODESYS update page for more information on how to obtain the software update: <https://www.codesys.com/download/>

As part of a security strategy, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to reduce the risk of exploits:

* Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from outside.
* Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks.
* Use VPN (virtual private networks) tunnels if remote access is required.
* Activate and apply user management and password features.
* Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
* Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions. For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the [CODESYS security whitepaper](https://customers.codesys.com/fileadmin/data/customers/security/CODESYS-Security-Whitepaper.pdf).

**--------- Begin Update A Part 3 of 3 ---------**

For more information, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has released a [security report](https://customers.codesys.com/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=12940&token=7723e5ed99830656f487e218e73dce2de751102f&download=).

Advisory 2019-05

1  Affected Products

All CODESYS Development System V3 versions prior V3.5.16.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This applies
to both the 32-bit and 64-bit variants.

2  Vulnerability overview

2.1  Type

Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

2.2  Management Summary

The CODESYS Development System may display or execute malicious active contents of the library
documentation without first checking the validity.

2.3  References

CVE: CVE-2019-13538 [6]

ICS-CERT: ICSA-19-255-02 [8]

CODESYS JIRA: CDS-62029, CDS-67819

2.4  Severity Rating

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has rated this vulnerability as high.

The CVSS v3.0 base score of 8.6 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is
(CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). [7]

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Development System is an IEC 61131-3 programming tool for the industrial controller and
automation technology sector. The source code of CODESYS projects or parts of it can be packaged into
compiled libraries to pass this code on or use it in other projects. Documentation is an elementary part of the
CODESYS libraries. In addition to the usually chosen straight representation of the documentation, the
documentation can also be enriched with active contents. Since the CODESYS Development System tries to
display these without checking the validity, malicious contents of manipulated libraries may also be displayed or
executed. The issue exits also for source libraries but 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH strongly
recommends distributing compiled libraries only.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited by or with the help of local users.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

4  Available software updates

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has released version V3.5.16.0 to solve the noted vulnerability issue for all
affected CODESYS products.

Please visit the CODESYS update area for more information on how to obtain the software update [3].

Advisory 2019-05

It turned out that the previous fix in version V3.5.15.0 was incomplete. Therefore, we recommend an update to
V3.5.16.0 to close the vulnerability, regardless of the version used so far.

Since CODESYS V3.5.15.0, JavaScript included in the library documentation is only executed, if the library was
correctly signed with a valid certificate.

5  Mitigation

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerability.

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has currently found no workaround for this vulnerability. Therefore, you
should only install and use CODESYS libraries from trustworthy sources, in case the software update is not
applied.

As part of a security strategy, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends the following general defense
measures to reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].

6  Acknowledgments

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH thanks those in the security community, who help us to improve our
products and to protect customers and users through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

We thank Heinz Füglister of WRH Walter Reist Holding AG for reporting this vulnerability following coordinated
