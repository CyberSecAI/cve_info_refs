The provided content is related to CVE-2019-13556.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data lengths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflow could allow for remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker with network access to the affected device and a low skill level can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also requires a valid user account/credentials to perform the attack since the CVSS vector indicates low privilege is required (PR:L).
