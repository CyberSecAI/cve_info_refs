Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-13118:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a type used to store grouping characters in an `xsl:number` instruction being too narrow. This could lead to an invalid character/length combination being passed to the `xsltNumberFormatDecimal` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Uninitialized Read**: Due to the narrow type, an invalid character/length combination could cause `xsltNumberFormatDecimal` to read uninitialized data from the stack. This also could lead to a stack overflow, as mentioned in some sources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure**: An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to read uninitialized stack data and view sensitive information.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** A stack overflow is referenced in one of the Apple advisories (iCloud for Windows) which may lead to denial of service as well.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious XSLT/XML Documents:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted XSLT document with a vulnerable `xsl:number` instruction or through a crafted XML file that leverages the vulnerable xsl function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted XSLT/XML document to be processed by the vulnerable `libxslt` library. This could be achieved through various channels (e.g., web server using vulnerable software, email with malicious XSLT attachment, etc.).
- No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is found in `numbers.c` file within the `libxslt` library.
*   The specific vulnerable functions are `xsltFormatNumberConversion` and `xsltNumberFormatDecimal` according to the git commit message and the Debian advisory.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is to ensure the character type used for storing grouping characters is wide enough to avoid truncation.
*   The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz.
