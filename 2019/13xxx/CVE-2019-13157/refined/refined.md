- Root cause of vulnerability: Directory traversal sequences in a filename within an nsz archive.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Arbitrary file overwrite via directory traversal.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can overwrite arbitrary files.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious nsz archive containing directory traversal sequences in filenames.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Remote attacker, capable of creating a malicious nsz archive.
