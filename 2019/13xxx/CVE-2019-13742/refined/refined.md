Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13742:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Incorrect security UI in Omnibox" within Google Chrome on iOS. The Omnibox, also known as the URL bar, is not displaying security information correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Security UI:** The primary weakness is the flawed user interface in the Omnibox, which fails to accurately represent the actual domain being visited.
*   **Domain Spoofing:** This leads to the possibility of domain spoofing, where a malicious website can display a misleading or completely fake URL in the address bar.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofed URLs:** An attacker can craft a domain name that appears legitimate to the user, even when it's a malicious site. This can trick users into trusting fake sites.
*  **Information Theft**: The main integrity impact is the user's potential inability to distinguish between safe and fake websites leading to the input of credentials, personal information, and payment information to the fake site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the user's device.
*   **Crafted HTML Page:** The attacker exploits this vulnerability by tricking the user into visiting a specially crafted HTML page that contains the malicious domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the network.
*   **Ability to Craft HTML:** The attacker must possess the ability to create malicious HTML content that exploits the Omnibox UI flaw.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be enticed to visit the malicious page to fall victim to the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability specifically affects Google Chrome on iOS.
*   The vulnerability was resolved in Chrome version 79.0.3945.79.

The provided content from various sources consistently points to a user interface issue in the Omnibox leading to the potential for domain spoofing. Specifically, the SUSE security advisory provides a clear and concise summary, the Gentoo security advisory lists it among many other vulnerabilities, and the Fedora security advisory lists it as one of the CVEs fixed with their update. RedHat also lists the vulnerability along with associated tracking bugs and the fix. The chromium release blog and Debian security advisory also describe the fixes for CVE-2019-13742.

The content indicates that the vulnerability is exploitable remotely and can be used to trick the user into visiting malicious sites via crafted HTML pages by using incorrect URL presentation.
