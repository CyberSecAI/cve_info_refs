CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13232
Debian Bug     : 932404

The unzip security update issued as DLA 1846-1 caused a regression
when building the Firefox web browser from source.

There is a zip-like file in the Firefox distribution, omni.ja, which is
a zip container with the central directory placed at the start of the
file instead of after the local entries as required by the zip standard.
This update now permits such containers to not raise a zip bomb alert,
where in fact there are no overlaps.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
6.0-16+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.

## Summary

This article shows how to construct a
*non-recursive* [zip bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb)
that achieves a high compression ratio by
overlapping files inside the zip container.
"Non-recursive" means that it does not rely on
a decompressor's recursively unpacking zip files nested within zip files:
it expands fully after a single round of decompression.
The output size increases quadratically in the input size,
reaching a compression ratio of over 28Â million
(10Â MB â 281Â TB)
at the limits of the zip format.
Even greater expansion is possible using
64-bit extensions.
The construction uses only the most common compression algorithm, DEFLATE,
and is compatible with most zip parsers.

I would like to know/credit the maker of
42.zip but haven't been able to find a sourceâ[let me know](#contact)
if you have any info.
There's a reference to 42.zip already in
[a vuln-dev post
from 2001-06-19](https://seclists.org/vuln-dev/2001/Jun/159).

On [2023-05-16](https://crt.sh/?id=9400699302)
there appeared <https://42.zip/>
using the then-new [.zip](https://domains.google/tld/zip/) TLD.
The web server there naturally serves a copy of 42.zip.
The Wayback Machine has a copy timestamped
[2023-05-16 16:51:08](https://web.archive.org/web/20230516165108/https%3A//42.zip/).
I made a copy here: [42.zip](tld/42.zip).

This 42.zip is a little different than the one I compared against.
Its total compressed size is 42â¯790 bytes
rather than 42â¯374 bytes.
I suspect it is less original than the one I used,
the evidence from timestamps:
the timestamps increase as you go from the bottom level to the top,
but in the 42â¯790-byte file,
the top "lib" level jumps 8Â hours backwards.
In fact, it is *exactly* 8Â hours behind the 42.zip I used,
which makes me suspect that at some point
someone uncompressed and re-compressed the original in a different time zone.

By [2023-05-26](https://web.archive.org/web/20230526223103/http%3A//42.zip/)
the zip bomb had gone and the server response changed to just `<html>hello</html>`.

Compression bombs that use the zip format
must cope with the fact that DEFLATE,
the compression algorithm most commonly supported by zip parsers,
[cannot achieve](https://www.zlib.net/zlib_tech.html) a compression ratio greater than 1032.
For this reason, zip bombs typically rely on recursive decompression,
nesting zip files within zip files to get an extra factor of 1032 with each layer.
But the trick only works on implementations that
unzip recursively, and most do not.
The best-known zip bomb,
[42.zip](https://www.unforgettable.dk/),
expands to a formidable 4.5Â PB
if all six of its layers are recursively unzipped,
but a trifling 0.6Â MB at the top layer.
Zip quines,
like those of [Ellingsen](https://web.archive.org/web/20160130230432/http%3A//www.steike.com/code/useless/zip-file-quine/)
and [Cox](https://research.swtch.com/zip),
which contain a copy of themselves
and thus expand infinitely if recursively unzipped,
are likewise perfectly safe to unzip once.

This article shows how to construct a non-recursive zip bomb
whose compression ratio surpasses the DEFLATE limit of 1032.
It works by overlapping files inside the zip container,
in order to reference a "kernel" of highly compressed data
in multiple files,
without making multiple copies of it.
The zip bomb's output size grows quadratically in the input size; i.e.,
the compression ratio gets better as the bomb gets bigger.
The construction depends on features of both zip and DEFLATEâit
is not directly portable to other file formats or compression algorithms.
It is compatible with most zip parsers,
the exceptions being "streaming" parsers that
parse in one pass without first consulting the zip file's central directory.
We try to balance
two conflicting goals:

* Maximize the compression ratio.
  We define the compression ratio as the the sum of the sizes
  of all the files contained the in the zip file,
  divided by the size of the zip file itself.
  It does not count filenames or other filesystem metadata,
  only contents.
* Be compatible.
  Zip is a tricky format and parsers differ, especially
  around edge cases and optional features.
  Avoid taking advantage of tricks that only work with certain parsers.
  We will remark on certain ways to increase the efficiency of the zip bomb
  that come with some loss of compatibility.

## Structure of a zip file

AÂ zip file consists of
a *central directory* which references
*files*.

![A block diagram of the structure of a zip file. The central directory header consists of three central directory headers labeled CDH[1] (README), CDH[1] (Makefile), and CDH[3] (demo.c). The central directory headers point backwards to three local file headers LFH[1] (README), LFH[2] (Makefile), and LFH[3] (demo.c). Each local file header is joined with file data. The three joined blocks of (local file header, file data) are labeled file 1, file 2, and file 3.](normal.png)

The central directory is at the end of the zip file.
It is a list of *central directory headers*.
Each central directory header contains metadata for a single file,
like its filename and CRC-32 checksum,
and a backwards pointer to a local file header.
AÂ central directory header is 46Â bytes long,
plus the length of the filename.

AÂ file consists of a *local file header*
followed by compressed *file data*.
The local file header is 30Â bytes long,
plus the length of the filename.
It contains a redundant copy
of the metadata from the central directory header,
and the compressed and uncompressed sizes of the file data
that follows.
Zip is a container format, not a compression algorithm.
Each file's data is compressed
using an algorithm specified in the metadataâusually [DEFLATE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951).

The many redundancies and ambiguities in the zip format
allow for all kinds of mischief.
The zip bomb is just scratching the surface.

This description of the zip format omits many details that
are not needed for understanding the zip bomb.
For full information,
refer to
[sectionÂ 4.3 of APPNOTE.TXT](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT)
or [The structure of a PKZip file](https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html) by Florian Buchholz,
or see the [source code](#source).

## The first insight: overlapping files

By compressing a long string of repeated bytes,
we can produce a *kernel*
of highly compressed data.
By itself, the kernel's compression ratio cannot
exceed the DEFLATE limit of 1032,
so we want a way to reuse the kernel in many files,
without making a separate copy of it in each file.
We can do it by overlapping files:
making many central directory headers point to
a single file, whose data is the kernel.

![A block diagram of a zip file with fully overlapping files. The central directory header consists of central directory headers CDH[1], CDH[2], ..., CDH[Nâ1], CDH[N], with filenames A, B, ..., Y, Z. There is a single local file header LFH[1] with filename A whose file data is a compressed kernel. Every one of the central directory headers points backwards to the same local file header, LFH[1]. The lone file is multiply labeled file 1, file 2, ..., file Nâ1, file N.](overlap.png)

Let's look at an example to see how this construction affects the compression ratio.
Suppose the kernel is 1000Â bytes and
decompresses to 1Â MB.
Then the first MB of output "costs"
1078Â bytes of input:

* 31Â bytes for a local file header (including a 1-byte filename)
* 47Â bytes for a central directory header (including a 1-byte filename)
* 1000Â bytes for the kernel itself

But every 1Â MB of output
after the first costs only 47Â bytesâwe don't need another local file header or another copy of the kernel,
only an additional central directory header.
So while the first reference of the kernel has a compression ratio of
1â¯000â¯000Â /Â 1078 âÂ 928,
each additional reference pulls the ratio closer to
1â¯000â¯000Â /Â 47 âÂ 21â¯277.
AÂ bigger kernel raises the ceiling.

The problem with this idea is a lack of compatibility.
Because many central directory headers point to a single local file header,
the metadataâspecifically the filenameâcannot match for every file.
Some parsers [balk at that](#compatibility).
[Info-ZIP UnZip](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/UnZip.html)
(the standard Unix `unzip` program)
extracts the files, but with warnings:

```

$ unzip overlap.zip
  inflating: A
B:  mismatching "local" filename (A),
         continuing with "central" filename version
  inflating: B
...

```

And the Python [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html) module
[throws an exception](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.7.0/Lib/zipfile.py#L1486-L1489):

```

$ python3 -m zipfile -e overlap.zip .
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
__main__.BadZipFile: File name in directory 'B' and header b'A' differ.

```

Next we will see how to modify the construction
for consistency of filenames,
while still retaining most of the advantage
of overlapping files.

## The second insight: quoting local file headers

We need to separate the local file headers for each file,
while still reusing a single kernel.
Simply concatenating all the local file headers does not work,
because the zip parser will find a local file header
where it expects to find the beginning of a DEFLATE stream.
But the idea will work, with a minor modification.
We'll use a feature of DEFLATE, non-compressed blocks,
to "quote" local file headers
so that they appear to be part of the same DEFLATE stream
that terminates in the kernel.
Every local file header
(except the first)
will be interpreted in two ways:
as code (part of the structure of the zip file)
and as data (part of the contents of a file).

![A block diagram of a zip file with quoted local file headers. The central directory header consists of central directory headers CDH[1], CDH[2], ..., CDH[Nâ1], CDH[N], with filenames A, B, ..., Y, Z. The central directory headers point to corresponding local file headers LFH[1], LFH[2], ..., LFH[Nâ1], LFH[N] with filenames A, B, ..., Y, Z. The files are drawn and labeled to show that file 1 does not end before file 2 begins; rather file 1 contains file 2, file 2 contains file 3, and so on. There is a small green-colored space between LFH[1] and LFH[2], and between LFH[2] and LFH[3], etc., to stand for quoting the following local file header using an uncompressed DEFLATE block. The file data of the final file, whose local file header is LFH[N] and whose filename is Z, does not contain any other files, only the compressed kernel.](quote.png)

A DEFLATE stream is a sequence of
[blocks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951#section-3.2.3),
where each block may be compressed or non-compressed.
Compressed blocks are what we usually think of;
for example the kernel is one big compressed block.
But there are also non-compressed blocks,
which start with a
[5-byte header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951#section-3.2.4)
with a length field that means simply, "output the next n bytes verbatim."
Decompressing a non-compressed block means only stripping the 5-byte header.
Compressed and non-compressed blocks may be intermixed freely
in a DEFLATE stream.
The output is the concatenation of
decompressing all the blocks in order.
The "non-compressed" notion only has meaning at the DEFLATE layer;
the file data still counts as "compressed" at the zip layer,
no matter what kind of blocks are used.

It is easiest to understand this quoted-overlap construction from the inside out,
beginning with the last file and working backwards to the first.
Start by inserting the kernel, which will form the end of file data for every file.
Prepend a local file header LFHN
and add a central directory header CDHN that points to it.
Set the "compressed size" metadata field in the LFHN and CDHN to the compressed size of the kernel.
Now prepend a 5-byte non-compressed block header (colored green in the diagram)
whose length field is equal to the size of LFHN.
Prepend a second local file header LFHNâ1
and add a central directory header CDHNâ1 that points to it.
Set the "compressed size" metadata field in both of the new headers to the compressed size of the kernel
*plus* the size of the non-compressed block header (5Â bytes)
*plus* the size of LFHN.

2019-08-22:
There's an additional minor optimization possible
that I didn't originally think of.
Instead of only quoting the immediately following local file header,
quote as many local file headers as possibleâincluding
their own quoting blocksâup to the limit of
65535 bytes per non-compressed block.
The advantage is that the quoting blocks between local file headers
now additionally become part of the output file,
gaining 5Â bytes of output for each one we manage to include.
It's a small optimization, gaining only 154â¯380 bytes
in zbsm.zip, or 0.003%.
(Far less than [extra-field quoting](#extra) gains.)
The `--giant-steps` option in the [source code](#source) activates this feature.

[![An illustration of giant-steps quoting. Each DEFLATE block quotes three following local file headers and the two DEFLATE blocks between them, and links up with the third DEFLATE block fllowing. The exception is the last two DEFLATE blocks, which only jump ahead two and one steps, because that's all there's room for.](giant-steps.jpg)](giant-steps.jpg)

The giant-steps feature only pays when you are not constrained by maximum output file size.
In zblg.zip, we actually want to slow file growth as much as possible
so that the smallest file, containing the kernel, can be as large as possible.
Using giant steps in zblg.zip actually decreases the compression ratio.

I credit [Kevin Farrow](https://twitter.com/kevinafarrow)
for sparking the idea for this enhancement
during a [dc303 talk](/talks/denhac-zipbomb/).
Carlos Javier GonzÃ¡lez CortÃ©s (Lethani) also hit on the idea in
[his article](https://hackinglethani.com/zip-bombs-iii/)
([EspaÃ±ol](https://hackinglethani.com/es/bombas-zip-iii/))
on overlapped zip bombs.

At this point the zip file contains two files, named "Y" and "Z".
Let's walk through what a zip parser would see while parsing it.
Suppose the compressed size of the kernel is 1000Â bytes
and the size of LFHN is 31Â bytes.
We start at CDHNâ1
and follow the pointer to LFHNâ1.
The first file's filename is "Y" and
the compressed size of its file data is 1036Â bytes.
Interpreting the next 1036 bytes as a DEFLATE stream,
we first encounter the 5-byte header of a non-compressed block
that says to copy the next 31Â bytes.
We write the next 31Â bytes,
which are LFHN,
which we decompress and append to file "Y".
Moving on in the DEFLATE stream, we find a compressed block (the kernel),
which we decompress to file "Y".
Now we have reached the end of the compressed data and are done with file "Y".
Proceeding to the next file, we follow the pointer from CDHN
to LFHN and find a file named "Z"
whose compressed size is 1000Â bytes.
Interpreting those 1000Â bytes as a DEFLATE stream,
we immediately encounter a compressed block (the kernel again)
and decompress it to the file "Z".
Now we have reached the end of the final file and are done.
The output file "Z" contains the decompressed kernel;
the output file "Y" is the same, but additionally prefixed by
the 31Â bytes of
LFHN.

We complete the construction by repeating the quoting procedure
until the zip file contains the desired number of files.
Each new file adds a central directory header,
a local file header,
and a non-compressed block to quote the immediately succeeding local file header.
Compressed file data is generally a chain of DEFLATE non-compressed blocks
(the quoted local file headers)
followed by the compressed kernel.
Each byte in the kernel contributes about
1032â¯N to the output size,
because each byte is part of all N files.
The output files are not all the same size:
those that appear earlier in the zip file
are larger than those that appear later,
because they contain more quoted local file headers.
The contents of the output files are not particularly meaningful,
but no one said they had to make sense.

This quoted-overlap construction has better compatibility
than the full-overlap construction of the previous section,
but the compatibility comes at the expense of the compression ratio.
There, each added file cost only a central directory header;
here, it costs a central directory header,
a local file header,
and another 5Â bytes for the quoting header.

## Optimization

Now that we have the basic zip bomb construction,
we will try to make it as efficient as possible.
We want to answer two questions:

* For a given zip file size, what is the maximum compression ratio?
* What is the maximum compression ratio, given the limits of the zip format?

### Kernel compression

It pays to compress the kernel as densely as possible,
because every decompressed byte gets magnified by a factor of N.
To that end, we use a custom DEFLATE compressor
called bulk\_deflate,
specialized for compressing
a string of repeated bytes.

All decent DEFLATE compressors will approach a compression ratio of 1032
when given an infinite stream of repeating bytes,
but we care more about specific finite sizes
than asymptotics.
bulk\_deflate compresses more data
into the same space than the general-purpose compressors:
about 26Â kB more than zlib and Info-ZIP,
and about 15Â kB more than
[Zopfli](https://github.com/google/zopfli),
a compressor that trades speed for density.

![A scatterplot showing the maximum uncompressed data for a given DEFLATE stream size, for four compression engines: bulk_deflate, Zopfli, zlib, and Info-ZIP. The points form three lines because zlib and Info-ZIP were identical. All three lines have a slope of 1032. For a given DEFLATE stream size, bulk_deflate compresses about 15 kB more than Zopfli, and Zopfli compresses about 10 kB more than zlib/Info-ZIP.](max_uncompressed_size.png)

The price of bulk\_deflate's high compression ratio is a lack of generality.
bulk\_deflate can only compress strings of a single repeated byte,
and only those of specific lengths,
namely 517Â +Â 258â¯k for integer kÂ â¥Â 0.
Besides compressing densely, bulk\_deflate is fast,
doing essentially constant work regardless of the input size,
aside from the work of actually writing out the compressed string.

### Filenames

Every byte spent on a filename is 2Â bytes not spent on the kernel.
(2Â because each filename appears twice, in the central directory header and the local file header.)
AÂ filename byte results in, on average,
only (NÂ +Â 1)â¯/â¯4 bytes of output,
while a byte in the kernel counts for 1032â¯N.

For our purposes, filenames are mostly dead weight.
While filenames do contribute something to the output size
by virtue of being part of quoted local file headers,
a byte in a filename does not contribute nearly as much
as a byte in the kernel.
We want filenames to be as short as possible,
while keeping them all distinct,
and subject to compatibility considerations.

Examples:
[1](https://bugs.python.org/issue10614)
[2](https://bugs.python.org/issue10972)
[3](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yauzl/issues/84)

The first compatibility consideration is character encoding.
The zip format specification states that filenames
are to be interpreted as [CPÂ 437](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437),
or [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) if a certain flag bit is set
([APPNOTE.TXT AppendixÂ D](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT)).
But this is a major point of incompatibility
across zip parsers,
which may interpret filenames as being in
some fixed or locale-specific encoding.
So for compatibility, we must limit ourselves to characters
that have the same encoding in both
CPÂ 437 and UTF-8;
namely, the 95 printable characters of US-ASCII.

One thing I didn't consider is
[Windows
reserved filenames like "PRN" and "NUL"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions).

We are further restricted by filesystem naming limitations.
Some filesystems are case-insensitive, so "a" and "A" do not count as distinct names.
Common filesystems like FAT32
[prohibit certain characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Limits)
like '\*' and '?'.

As a safe but not necessarily optimal compromise,
our zip bomb will use filenames consisting of characters
drawn from a 36-character alphabet
that does not
rely on case distinctions
or use special characters:

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
A
B
C
D
E
F
G
H
I
J
K
L
M
N
O
P
Q
R
S
T
U
V
W
X
Y
Z

Filenames are generated in the obvious way,
cycling each position through the possible characters
and adding a position on overflow:

"0", "1", "2", …, "Z",

"00", "01", "02", …, "0Z",

…,

"Z0", "Z1", "Z2", …, "ZZ",

"000", "001", "002", …

There are 36 filenames of lengthÂ 1,
362 filenames of lengthÂ 2, and so on.
The length of the nth filename is
⌊log36((nÂ +Â 1)Â /Â (36â¯/â¯35))⌋Â +Â 1.

Four bytes are enough to represent
1â¯727â¯604 distinct filenames.

Given that the N filenames in the zip file
are generally not all of the same length,
which way should we order them,
shortest to longest or longest to shortest?
AÂ little reflection shows that it is better to
put the longest names last, because those names are the most quoted.
Ordering filenames longest last
adds over 900Â MB of output
to [zblg.zip](#allocation),
compared to ordering them longest first.
It is a minor optimization, though,
as those 900Â MB
comprise only 0.0003%
of the total output size.

### Kernel size

The quoted-overlap construction
allows us to place a compressed kernel of data,
and then cheaply copy it many times.
For a given zip file sizeÂ X,
how much space should we devote to storing the kernel,
and how much to making copies?

To find the optimum balance,
we only have to optimize the single variable N,
the number of files in the zip file.
Every value of N requires
a certain amount of overhead for
central directory headers,
local file headers,
quoting block headers, and filenames.
All the remaining space can be taken up by the kernel.
Because N has to be an integer,
and you can only fit so many files
before the kernel size drops to zero,
it suffices to test every possible value of N
and select the one that yields the most output.

Applying the optimization procedure to XÂ =Â 42â¯374,
the size of 42.zip,
finds a maximum at NÂ =Â 250.
Those 250 files require 21â¯195 bytes of overhead,
leaving 21â¯179 bytes for the kernel.
AÂ kernel of that size decompresses to 21â¯841â¯249 bytes
(aÂ ratio of 1031.3).
The 250 copies of the decompressed kernel,
plus the little bit extra that comes from the quoted local file headers,
produces an overall unzipped output of
5â¯461â¯307â¯620Â bytes
and aÂ compression ratio of 129Â thousand.

```

Optimization produced an almost even split
between the space allocated to the kernel
and the space allocated to file headers.
It is not a coincidence.
Let's look at a simplified model of the quoted-overlap construction.
In the simplified model,
we ignore filenames,
as well as the slight increase in output file size
due to quoting local file headers.
Analysis of the simplified model will show that the optimum
split between kernel and file headers is approximately even,
and that the output size grows quadratically
when allocation is optimal.

Define some constants and variables:

| X |  | zip file size (take as fixed) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N |  | number of files in the zip file (variable to optimize) |
| CDH | Â =Â 46 | size of a central directory header (without filename) |
| LFH | Â =Â 30 | size of a local file header (without filename) |
| Q | Â =Â 5 | the size of DEFLATE non-compressed block header |
| C | Â âÂ 1032 | compression ratio of the kernel |

Let H(N)
be the amount of header overhead required by N files.
Refer to
[the diagram](#fig-quote)
to understand where this formula comes from.

| H(N) | Â = NÂ âÂ (CDH + LFH) + (NÂ âÂ 1)Â âÂ Q |
| --- | --- |

The space remaining for the kernel is
XÂ âÂ H(N).
The total unzipped size
SX(N)
is the size of N copies
of the kernel,
decompressed at ratioÂ C.
(In this simplified model we ignore
the minor additional expansion from quoted local file headers.)

| SX(N) | Â = (X â H(N))â¯Câ¯N |
| --- | --- |
|  | Â = (X â (N â (CDH + LFH) + (N â 1) â Q))â¯Câ¯N |
|  | Â = â(CDH + LFH + Q)â¯Câ¯N2 + (X + Q)â¯Câ¯N |

SX(N) is a polynomial in N,
so its maximum must be at a place where the derivative
Sâ²X(N)
is zero.
Taking the derivative and finding the zero gives us
NOPT,
the optimal number of files.

| Sâ²X(NOPT) | Â = â2â¯(CDH + LFH + Q)â¯Câ¯NOPT + (X + Q)â¯C |
| --- | --- |
| 0 Â = â2â¯(CDH + LFH + Q)â¯Câ¯NOPT + (X + Q)â¯C | |
| NOPT | Â = (X + Q) / (CDH + LFH + Q) / 2 |

H(NOPT)
gives the optimal amount of space to allocate for file headers.
It is independent of CDH, LFH, and C,
and is close to Xâ¯/â¯2.

| H(NOPT) | Â = NOPT â (CDH + LFH) + (NOPT â 1) â Q |
| --- | --- |
|  | Â = (X â Q) / 2 |

SX(NOPT)
is the total unzipped size
when the allocation is optimal.
From this we see that the output size grows quadratically
in the input size.

| SX(NOPT) | Â = (X + Q)2â¯C / (CDH + LFH + Q) / 4 |
| --- | --- |

It's a little more complicated,
because the precise limits depend on the implementation.
Python zipfile
[ignores](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.7.0/Lib/zipfile.py#L1285-L1286)
the number of files.
Go archive/zip
[allows](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/38e512824336971bcb3d067ad46d01728501b959)
larger file counts, as long as they are equal in the lower 16 bits.
But for broad compatibility,
we have to stick to the limits as stated.

As we make the zip file larger,
eventually we run into the limits of the zip format.
AÂ zip file can contain at most 216Â âÂ 1 files,
and each file can have an uncompressed size of at most 232Â âÂ 1 bytes.
Worse than that,
[some implementations](#compatibility)
take the maximum possible values
as an indicator of the presence of [64-bit extensions](#zip64),
so our limits are actually 216Â âÂ 2 and 232Â âÂ 2.

It happens that the first limit we hit is the one on uncompressed file size.
At a zip file size of 8â¯319â¯377Â bytes,
naive optimization would give us a file count of 47â¯837
and a largest file of
232Â +Â 311 bytes.

Accepting that we cannot increase N nor the size of the kernel without bound,
we would like find the maximum compression ratio achievable
while remaining within the limits of the zip format.
The way to proceed is to make the kernel as large as possible,
and have the maximum number of files.
Even though we can no longer maintain the roughly even split
between kernel and file headers,
each added file *does* increase the compression ratioâjust
not as fast as it would if we were able to keep growing the kernel, too.
In fact, as we add files we will need to *decrease* the size of the kernel
to make room for the maximum file size
that gets slightly larger with each added file.

The plan results in a zip file
that contains 216Â âÂ 2 files and a kernel that decompresses
to 232Â âÂ 2â¯178â¯825 bytes.
Files get longer towards the beginning of the zip fileâthe
first and largest file decompresses to
232Â âÂ 56 bytes.
That is as close as we can get using the coarse
output sizes of bulk\_deflateâencoding
the final 54Â bytes would cost more bytes than they are worth.
(The zip file as a whole has a compression ratio
of 28Â million, and the final 54Â bytes would gain
at most 54Â âÂ 1032Â âÂ (216Â âÂ 2) â 36.5Â million bytes,
so it only helps if the 54Â bytes can be encoded
in 1Â byteâIÂ could not do it in less thanÂ 2.)
The output size of this zip bomb, 281â¯395â¯456â¯244â¯934Â bytes,
is 99.97% of the theoretical maximum
(232Â âÂ 1) â (216Â âÂ 1).

Any major improvements to the compression ratio can only come
from reducing the input size,
not increasing the output size.

## Efficient CRC-32 computation

Among the metadata in the central directory header and local file header
is a
[CRC-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)
checksum of the uncompressed file data.
This poses a problem, because directly calculating the CRC-32 of each file
requires doing work proportional to the total *unzipped* size,
which is large by design. (It's a zip bomb, after all.)
We would prefer to do work that in the worst case is
proportional to the *zipped* size.
Two factors work in our advantage:
all files share a common suffix (the kernel),
and the uncompressed kernel is a string of repeated bytes.
We will represent CRC-32 as a matrix productâthis
will allow us not only to compute the checksum of the kernel quickly,
but also to reuse computation across files.
The technique described in this section is a slight extension of the
[`crc32_combine`](https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/v1.2.11/crc32.c#L372)
function in zlib,
which Mark Adler explains
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23122312/crc-calculation-of-a-mostly-static-data-stream/23126768#23126768).

You can model CRC-32 as a state machine that updates a 32-bit state register
for each incoming bit.
The basic update operations for a 0Â bit and a 1Â bit are:

```
uint32 crc32_update_0(uint32 state) {
    // Shift out the least significant bit.
    bit b = state & 1;
    state = state >> 1;
    // If the shifted-out bit was 1, XOR with the CRC-32 constant.
    if (b == 1)
        state = state ^ 0xedb88320;
    return state;
}

uint32 crc32_update_1(uint32 state) {
    // Do as for a 0 bit, then XOR with the CRC-32 constant.
    return crc32_update_0(state) ^ 0xedb88320;
}
```

If you think of the state register as a 32-element binary vector,
and use XOR for addition and AND for multiplication, then
`crc32_update_0` is a
[linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map);
i.e., it can be represented as multiplication by a
32Ã32 binary
[transformation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix).
To see why, observe that multiplying a matrix by a vector
is just summing the columns of the matrix,
after multiplying each column by the corresponding element of the vector.
The shift operation `stateÂ >>Â 1`
is just taking each bitÂ i of the state vector
and multiplying it by a vector that is 0 everywhere except at bit iÂ âÂ 1
(numbering the bits from right to left).
The conditional final XOR `stateÂ ^Â 0xedb88320`
that only happens when bitÂ `b` is 1
can instead be represented as first multiplying
`b` by 0xedb88320
and then XORing it into the state.

Furthermore, `crc32_update_1` is just
`crc32_update_0` plus (XOR) aÂ constant.
That makes `crc32_update_1` an
[affine transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation):
aÂ matrix multiplication followed by a translation (i.e., vector addition).
We can represent both the matrix multiplication and the translation
in a single step
if we enlarge the dimensions of the transformation matrix to 33Ã33
and append an extra element to the state vector that is alwaysÂ 1.
(This representation is called
[homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix#Affine_transformations).)

The 33Ã33 transformation matrices M0 and M1 that compute
the CRC-32 state change effected by a 0Â bit and a 1Â bit respectively.
Column vectors are stored with the most significant bit at the bottom:
reading the first column from bottom to top, you see
the CRC-32 polynomial constant edb8832016 =
111011011011100010000011001000002.
The two matrices differ only in the final column, which represents a translation vector
in homogeneous coordinates.
In M0 the translation is zero and
in M1 it is edb8832016, the CRC-32 polynomial constant.
The 1's just above the diagonal represent the
shift operation `stateÂ >>Â 1`.

Both operations `crc32_update_0` and `crc32_update_1`
can be represented by a 33Ã33 transformation matrix.
The matrices M0 and M1 are shown.
The benefit of a matrix representation is that matrices compose.
Suppose we want to represent the state change effected by processing
the ASCII character 'a', whose binary representation is
011000012.
We can represent the cumulative CRC-32 state change of those 8Â bits
in a single transformation matrix:

| Ma | Â = M0 M1Â M1Â M0Â M0Â M0Â M0Â M1 |
| --- | --- |

And we can represent the state change of a string of repeated 'a's
by multiplying many copies of Ma togetherâmatrix exponentiation.
We can do matrix exponentiation quickly
using a [square-and-multiply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring) algorithm,
which allows us to compute Mn
in only about log2â¯n steps.
For example, the matrix representing the state change
of a string of 9Â 'a's is

| (M`a`)9 | Â = M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a` |
| --- | --- |
|  | Â = (M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a`Â M`a`)2Â M`a` |
|  | Â = ((M`a`Â M`a`)2)2Â M`a` |
|  | Â = (((M`a`)2)2)2Â M`a` |

The square-and-multiply algorithm is useful
for computing Mkernel,
the matrix for the uncompressed kernel,
because the kernel is a string of repeated bytes.
To produce a CRC-32 checksum value from a matrix,
multiply the matrix by the zero vector.
(The zero vector in homogeneous coordinates, that is:
32Â 0's followed by aÂ 1.
Here we omit the minor complication of pre- and post-conditioning the checksum.)
To compute the checksum for every file, we work backwards.
Start by initializing MÂ :=Â Mkernel.
The checksum of the kernel is also the checksum
of the final file, fileÂ N,
so multiply M by the zero vector and store the resulting checksum in
CDHN and LFHN.
The file data of fileÂ NÂ âÂ 1 is the same as the file data of fileÂ N,
but with an added prefix of LFHN.
So compute MLFHN,
the state change matrix for LFHN,
and update MÂ :=Â MÂ MLFHN.
Now M represents the cumulative state change from processing
LFHN followed by the kernel.
Compute the checksum for file NÂ âÂ 1 by again multiplying M by the zero vector.
Continue the procedure, accumulating state change matrices into M,
until all the files have been processed.

## Extension: Zip64

[Earlier](#allocation) we hit a wall on expansion
due to limits of the zip formatâit was impossible
to produce more than about 281Â TB of output,
no matter how cleverly packed the zip file.
It is possible to surpass those limits
using [Zip64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29#ZIP64),
an extension to the zip format that increases
the size of certain header fields to 64Â bits.
Support for Zip64 is [by no means universal](#compatibility),
but it is one of the more commonly implemented extensions.
As regards the compression ratio,
the effect of Zip64 is to
increase the size of a central directory header from
46Â bytes to 58Â bytes,
and the size of a local directory header from
30Â bytes to 50Â bytes.
Referring to
[the formula](#eq-S_X_N_OPT)
for optimal expansion in the simplified model,
we see that a zip bomb in Zip64 format
still grows quadratically,
but more slowly because of the larger denominatorâthis
is visible in
[the figure below](#zipped_size)
in the Zip64 line's
slightly lower vertical placement.
In exchange for the loss of compatibility
and slower growth,
we get the removal of all practical file size limits.

Suppose we want a zip bomb that expands to
4.5Â PB,
the same size that 42.zip recursively expands to.
How big must the zip file be?
Using binary search, we find that the smallest
zip file whose unzipped size exceeds the unzipped size of 42.zip
has a zipped size of
46Â MB.

[![](zip.png) zbxl.zip](zbxl.zip)
46Â MBÂ âÂ 4.5Â PB (Zip64, less compatible)
```
zipbomb --mode=quoted_overlap --num-files=190023 --compressed-size=22982788 --zip64 > zbxl.zip
```

4.5Â PB is roughly
the size of the data captured by the Event Horizon Telescope
to make the
[first image of a black hole](https://www.vice.com/en/article/597m7q/reddits-data-hoarders-are-freaking-out-over-all-that-black-hole-data),
stacks and stacks of hard drives.

With Zip64, it's no longer practically interesting to
consider the maximum compression ratio,
because we can just keep increasing the zip file size,
and the compression ratio along with it,
until even the compressed zip file is prohibitively large.
An interesting threshold, though,
is
264Â bytes
(18Â EB or
16Â EiB)âthat
much data
[will not fit on most filesystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Limits).
Binary search finds the smallest zip bomb that produces at least that much output:
it contains 12Â million files
and has a compressed kernel of 1.5Â GB.
The total size of the zip file is
2.9Â GB
and it unzips to
264Â +Â 11â¯727â¯895â¯877 bytes,
having a compression ratio of over 6.2Â billion.
IÂ didn't make this one downloadable,
but you can generate it yourself using the [source code](#source).
It contains files so large that it uncovers
[a bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=929502)
in Info-ZIP UnZipÂ 6.0.

```

zipbomb --mode=quoted_overlap --num-files=12056313 --compressed-size=1482284040 --zip64 > zbxxl.zip

```

## Extension: bzip2

bzip2 starts with a run-length encoding step
that reduces the length of a string of repeated bytes
by a factor ofÂ 51.
Then the data is separated into
900Â kB blocks
and each block compressed individually.
Empirically, one block after run-length encoding
can compress down to 32Â bytes.
900â¯000Â Ã 51â¯/â¯32Â = 1â¯434â¯375.

DEFLATE is the most common compression algorithm
used in the zip format, but it is only one of many options.
Probably the second most common algorithm is [bzip2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2),
while not as compatible as DEFLATE,
is probably the second most commonly supported compression algorithm.
Empirically, bzip2 has a maximum compression ratio of about 1.4Â million,
which allows for denser packing of the kernel.
Ignoring the loss of compatibility,
does bzip2 enable a more efficient zip bomb?

Yesâbut only for small files.
The problem is that bzip2 does not have anything like the
[non-compressed blocks](#quote) of DEFLATE
that we used to [quote local file headers](#quote).
So it is not possible to overlap files and reuse the kernelâeach file must have
its own copy, and therefore the overall compression ratio
is no better than the ratio of any single file.
In [the figure](#zipped_size) we see that
no-overlap bzip2 outperforms quoted DEFLATE
only for files under about a megabyte.

There is still hope for using bzip2âan
alternative means of local file header quoting
discussed in [the next section](#extra).
Additionally,
if you happen to know that a certain zip parser supports bzip2
*and* tolerates mismatched filenames,
then you can use the [full-overlap construction](#overlap),
which has no need for quoting.

![Logâlog plot of unzipped size versus zipped size for different zip file constructions: DEFLATE, bzip2, quoted DEFLATE, and 42.zip (recursive and non-recursive).](zipped_size.png)

Zipped size versus unzipped size for various zip bomb constructions.
Note the logâlog scales.
Each construction is shown with and without Zip64.
The no-overlap constructions
have a linear rate of growth,
which is visible in the 1:1 slope of the lines.
The vertical offset of the bzip2 lines shows that the compression ratio
of bzip2 is about a thousand times greater than that of DEFLATE.
The quoted-DEFLATE constructions
have a quadratic rate of growth,
as evidenced by the 2:1 slope of the lines.
The Zip64 variant is slightly less efficient,
but permits output in excess of 281Â TB.
The lines for extra-field-quoted bzip2
transition from quadratic to linear
upon reaching either the maximum file size
(232Â âÂ 2 bytes),
or the maximum number of files allowed by extra-field quoting.

## Extension: extra-field quoting

So far we have used a feature of
DEFLATE to quote local file headers,
and we have just seen that the same trick
does not work with bzip2.
There is an alternative means of quoting,
somewhat more limited,
that only uses features of the zip format
and does not depend on the compression algorithm.

At the end of the local file header structure
there is a variable-length
*extra field* whose purpose is to store information
that doesn't fit into the ordinary fields of the header
([APPNOTE.TXT section 4.3.7](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT)).
The extra information may include, for example,
a high-resolution timestamp or a Unix uid/gid;
Zip64 works by using the extra field.
The extra field is a lengthâvalue structure:
if we increase the length field without adding to the value,
then it will grow to include whatever
comes after it in the zip fileânamely
the next local file header.
Each local file header "quotes" the local file headers that follow it
by enclosing them within its own extra field.
The benefits of extra-field quoting
over DEFLATE quoting
are threefold:

1. Extra-field quoting requires only 4Â bytes of overhead,
   notÂ 5, leaving more room for the kernel.
2. Extra-field quoting does not increase the size of files,
   which leaves more headroom for a bigger kernel when
   operating at the limits of the zip format.
3. Extra-field quoting provides a way to combine quoting with bzip2.

The [zipalign](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/zipalign) tool
from Android aligns files to 4-byte boundaries.
It works by
[padding the extra field with 0x00 bytes](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/%2B/refs/tags/android-9.0.0_r1/tools/zipalign/ZipEntry.cpp#215).
Thus it could be considered to use header ID 0x0000,
which is "reserved for use by PKWARE."
But because it may add 0, 1, 2, or 3Â bytes of padding,
and an extra field header is 4Â bytes,
the extra fields it produces may be invalid anyway.

Despite these benefits, extra-field quoting is less flexible
than DEFLATE quoting.
It does not chain:
each local file header must enclose not only the immediately next header
but *all* headers which follow.
The extra fields increase in length as they get closer
to the beginning of the zip file.
Because the extra field has a maximum length of
216Â âÂ 1 bytes,
it can only contain up to 1808
local file headers,
or 1170 with Zip64,
assuming that filenames are [allocated as described](#filenames).
(With DEFLATE,
you can use extra-field quoting for the earliest local file headers,
then switch to DEFLATE quoting for the remainder.)
Another problem is that, in order to conform
to the internal data structure of the extra field,
you must select a 16-bit *header ID*
([APPNOTE.TXT section 4.5.2](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT)).
to precede the quoted data.
We want a header ID that will make parsers
ignore the quoted data, not try to interpret it
as meaningful metadata.
Zip parsers are supposed to ignore unknown header IDs,
so we could choose one at random,
but there is the risk that the ID may be allocated in the future,
breaking compatibility.

[The figure](#zipped_size)
illustrates the possibility of combining extra-field quoting
with bzip2, with and without Zip64.
Both "extra-field-quoted bzip2" lines have a knee at which
the growth transitions from quadratic to linear.
In the non-Zip64 case, the knee occurs at the maximum uncompressed file size
(232Â âÂ 2 bytes);
after this point, one can only increase the number of files, not their size.
The line stops completely when the number of files reaches 1809,
and we run out of room in the
extra field.
In the Zip64 case, the knee occurs at 1171 files,
after which the size of files can be increased, but not their number.
Extra-field quoting may also be used with DEFLATE,
but the improvement is so slight
that it has been omitted from the figure.
It increases the compression ratio of

zbsm.zip by 1.2%;

## Discussion

In related work,
[PlÃ¶tz etÂ al.](http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/index.htm#SAR-PR-2006-04)
used overlapping files to create a
near-self-replicating zip file.
Gynvael Coldwind
has [previously suggested](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=682) (slideÂ 47)
overlapping files.
[Pellegrino etÂ al.](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions/presentation/pellegrino)
found systems vulnerable to compression bombs
and other resource exhaustion attacks
and listed common pitfalls in specification,
implementation, and configuration.

We have designed the quoted-overlap zip bomb construction for compatibility,
taking into consideration a number of implementation differences,
some of which are shown in [the table below](#compatibility).
The resulting construction is compatible with zip parsers that work
in the usual back-to-front way,
first consulting the central directory
and using it as an index of files.
Among these is the example
zip parser included in [Nail](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/bangert),
which is automatically generated from a formal grammar.
The construction is not compatible, however,
with "streaming" parsers,
those that parse the zip file from beginning to end in one pass
without first reading the central directory.
By their nature, streaming parsers
do not permit any kind of file overlapping.
The most likely outcome is that they
will extract only the first file.
They may even raise an error besides,
as is the case with [sunzip](https://github.com/madler/sunzip),
which parses the central directory at the end and checks it for consistency
with the local file headers it has already seen.

If you need the extracted files to start with a certain prefix
(so that they will be identified as a certain file type, for example),
you can insert a data-carrying DEFLATE block just before the
block that quotes the next header.
Not every file has to participate in the bomb construction:
you can include ordinary files
alongside the bomb files
if you need the zip file to conform to some higher-level format.
(The [source code](#source) has a `--template`
option to facilitate this use case.)
Many file formats use zip as a container;
examples are Java JAR, Android APK, and LibreOffice documents.

[PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF)
is in many ways similar to zip.
It has a cross-reference table at the end of the file
that points to objects earlier in the file,
and it supports DEFLATE compression of objects through
the FlateDecode filter.
Didier Stevens
[writes](https://blog.didierstevens.com/2008/05/19/pdf-stream-objects/)
about having contained a 1Â GB stream inside a
2.6Â kB PDF file
by stacking FlateDecode filters.
If a PDF parser limits the amount of stacking,
then it is probably possible to use the DEFLATE quoting idea
to overlap PDF objects.

The central directory is located indirectly
using another structure called the *end of central directory* (EOCD).
The EOCD ends in a variable-length comment field
and finding it requires scanning for a magic number.
libziparchive
[calls](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/%2B/refs/tags/android-9.0.0_r1/libziparchive/zip_archive.cc#282)
the process the
"traditional EOCD snipe hunt" :)

Detecting the specific class of zip bomb we have developed in this article is easy:
look for overlapping files.
Mark Adler has written [a patch](https://github.com/madler/unzip/commits/6519bf0f8a896851d9708da11e1b63c818238c8f)
for Info-ZIP UnZip that does just that.

In general, though, rejecting overlapping files
does not by itself make it safe to handle untrusted zip files.
There are zip bombs that do not rely on overlapping files,
and there are malicious zip files that are not bombs.
Furthermore, any such detection logic must
be implemented inside the parser itself,
not as a separate prefilter.
One of the details
omitted from [the description of the zip format](#zip) is that
there is no single well-defined algorithm for locating
the central directory in a zip file:
two parsers may find two different central directories
and therefore
[may not even agree on what files a zip file contains](https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=682)
(slides 67â80).
Predicting the total uncompressed size
by summing the sizes of all files
does not work, in general,
because the sizes stored in metadata
[may not match](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity15/technical-sessions/presentation/pellegrino)
(Â§4.2.2)
the actual uncompressed sizes.
(See the "permits too-short file size" row in [the compatibility table](#compatibility).)
Robust protection against zip bombs
involves sandboxing the parser to limit
its use of time, memory, and disk spaceâjust
as if you were processing image files,
or any other complex file format prone to parser bugs.

Compatibility of selected zip parsers with various zip features,
edge cases,
and zip bomb constructions.
The background colors indicate a scale from less restrictive to more restrictive.
For best compatibility,
use DEFLATE compression without Zip64,
match names in central directory headers and local file headers,
compute correct CRCs,
and avoid the maximum values of 32-bit and 16-bit fields.

Did you find a system that chokes on one of these zip bombs?
Did they help you demonstrate a vulnerability or
win a bug bounty?
[Let me know](#contact) and I'll try to mention it here.

LibreOffice 6.1.5.2

zblg.zip renamed to zblg.odt or zblg.docx
will cause LibreOffice to
create and delete a number of ~4Â GB temporary files
as it attempts to determine the file format.
It does eventually finish, and it deletes
the temporary files as it goes,
so it's only a temporary DoS that doesn't fill up the disk.
CaolÃ¡n McNamara replied to my bug report.

Mozilla addons-server 2019.06.06

I tried the zip bombs against a local installation of addons-server,
which is part of the software behind addons.mozilla.org.
The system handles it gracefully,
imposing a [time limit](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/blob/2019.06.06/src/olympia/lib/settings_base.py#L1457-L1458)
of 110Â s on extraction.
The zip bomb expands as fast as the disk will let it up to the time limit,
but after that point the process is killed and the unzipped files
are eventually automatically cleaned up.

UnZip 6.0

Mark Adler wrote
[a patch](https://github.com/madler/unzip/commits/6519bf0f8a896851d9708da11e1b63c818238c8f)
for UnZip to detect this class of zip bomb.

2019-07-05:
I noticed that [CVE-2019-13232](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13232)
was assigned for UnZip.
Personally, I would dispute that UnZip's (or any zip parser's)
ability to process a zip bomb of the kind discussed here
necessarily represents a security vulnerability, or even a bug.
It's a natural implementation and does not violate the specification
in any way that I can tell.
The type discussed in this article is only one type of zip bomb,
and there are many ways in which zip parsing can go wrong that are not bombs.
If you want to defend against resource exhaustion attacks,
you should *not* try to enumerate, detect, and block
every individual known attack;
rather you should impose external limits on time and other resources
so that the parser cannot misbehave too much,
no matter what kind of attack it faces.
There is nothing wrong with attempting to detect and reject certain
constructions as a first-pass optimization,
but you can't stop there.
If you do not eventually isolate and limit
operations on untrusted data, your system is likely still vulnerable.
Consider an analogy with [cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) in HTML:
the right defense is not to try and filter out bytes that may be interpreted as code,
it's to escape everything properly.

Mark Adler's patch made its way into Debian in
[bugÂ #931433](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931433).

There were some unanticipated consequences:
problems parsing certain Java JARs
([bug #931895](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931895))
and problems with the mutant zip format of Firefox's omni.ja file
([bug #932404](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=932404)).
SUSE decided
[not to do anything](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1140748#c2)
about CVE-2019-13232.
I think both Debian's and SUSE's choices are defensible.

ronomon/zip

Shortly after the publication of this article,
Joran Dirk Greef published a
[restrictive zip parser](https://github.com/ronomon/zip) (JavaScript)
that prohibits irregularities such as overlapping files
or unused space between files.
While it may thereby reject certain valid zip files,
the idea is to ensure that any downstream parsers
will receive only clean, easy-to-parse files.

antivirus engines

Overall, it seems that malware scanners have slowly begun
to recognize zip bombs of this kind
(or at least the specific samples available for download)
as malicious.
It would be interesting to see whether the detection is robust or brittle.
You could reverse the order of the entries in the central directory, for example,
and see whether the zip files are still detected.
In the [source code](#source),
there's a recipe for generating zbsm.extra.zip,
which is like zbsm.zip except that it uses
[extra-field quoting](#extra) instead of
[DEFLATE quoting](#quote)âif you are a customer
of an AV service that detects zbsm.zip but not zbsm.extra.zip,
you should ask for an explanation.
Another simple variant is
[inserting spacer files between the bomb files](spacer.txt),
which may fool certain overlap-detection algorithms.

"McAfee AV on my test machine just exploded."
I haven't independently confirmed it, nor do I have details such as a version number.

Tavis Ormandy [points out](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/1146477576132542466)

that there are a number of "Timeout" results in
[the VirusTotal for zblg.zip](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f1dc920869794df3e258f42f9b99157104cd3f8c14394c1b9d043d6fcda14c0a/detection)

[The results for zbsm.zip](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/fb4ff972d21189beec11e05109c4354d0cd6d3b629263d6c950cf8cc3f78bd99/detection)
[(screenshot 2019-07-06)](vt-zbsm-20190706.png)
are similar, though with a different set of timed-out engines:
Baido, Bkav, ClamAV, CMC, DrWeb, Endgame, ESET-NOD32, F-Secure, GData, Kingsoft, McAfee-GW-Edition, NANO-Antivirus, Acronis.
Interestingly, there are no timeouts in
[the results for zbxl.zip](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/eafd8f574ea7fd0f345eaa19eae8d0d78d5323c8154592c850a2d78a86817744/detection);
[(screenshot 2019-07-06)](vt-zbxl-20190706.png)
perhaps this means that some antivirus doesn't support Zip64?

Forum user 100 [reported](https://forum.eset.com/topic/20123-zip-bombs-with-zip64-not-detected/)
that a certain ESET product did not detect zbxl.zip, possibly because it uses Zip64.
An update in the thread three days later showed the product being updated to detect it.

In [ClamAV bug 12356](https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=12356),
Hanno BÃ¶ck reported that zblg.zip caused high CPU usage
in clamscan.
[An initial patch](https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=12356#c5)
to detect overlapping files
[turned out to be incomplete](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q3/121)
because it only checked adjacent pairs of files.
(I personally mishandled this issue
by posting details of a workaround on the bug tracker,
instead of reporting it privately.)
[A later patch](https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=12356#c14)
imposed a time limit on file analysis.

2020-07-28: FlyTech Videos presented a
[video testing various zip bombs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peeYOqejWfg),
including [zbxl.zip](#zbxl),
against Windows Defender, Windows Explorer, and 7-zip.

web browsers

I didn't directly experience this myself,
but reports online say that Chrome and Safari may automatically unzip
files after downloading.

* [ittakir](https://habr.com/ru/post/459254/#comment_20369364): "Ð¡ÐºÐ°ÑÐ°Ð» ÑÐ°Ð¼ÑÐ¹ Ð¼Ð°Ð»ÐµÐ½ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÑÐ°Ð¹Ð» Ð½Ð° 5GB, Chrome ÑÑÑ Ð¶Ðµ Ð½Ð°ÑÐ°Ð» ÐµÐ³Ð¾ ÑÐ°ÑÐ¿Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ²Ð°ÑÑ, ÑÐ¾ÑÑ ÐµÐ³Ð¾ Ð¾Ð± ÑÑÐ¾Ð¼ Ð½Ðµ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¸, Ð½Ñ Ð¸ ÐºÑÑÐ°ÑÑ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐµÑÑÐ¾Ñ Ð¸ Ð´Ð¸ÑÐº." *"I downloaded the smallest file on 5GB, Chrome immediately began to unpack it, although it was not asked for it, well, to eat the processor and disk."*
* [Rzah](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/c8ylxn/zblg_nonrecursive_zip_bomb_with_a_280000001_ratio/esrsxvi/): "Yet another reason why 'Open Safe files after downloading' is a stupid default setting for a web browser."

Chromium commit [f04d9b15bd1cba1433ad5453bc3ebff933d0e3bb](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/f04d9b15bd1cba1433ad5453bc3ebff933d0e3bb) is perhaps related:

filesystems

Something I didn't anticipate:
unzipping one of the bombs on a compressed filesystem can be relatively safe.

* [flying\_gel](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/cbvqzu/the_most_clever_zip_bomb_ever_made_explodes_a/etkazxk/):
  "If I unzip this onto a compressed zfs dataset, will the resulting file be small? Edit: Just did a small test with a 42KB->5.5GB zip bomb. I ended up with 165MB worth of files so while just 3% of the full bomb, it's still a 4028 times inflation. ... I only have the standard LZ4 compression enabled, no dedup."

Twitter

Links to this article had been widely shared on Twitter
since around 2019-07-02,
but around 2019-07-20 it began showing
[an "unsafe link" interstitial](https://twitter.com/safety/unsafe_link_warning?unsafe_link=https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/)
([screenshot](twitter-unsafe.png), [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190721031831/https%3A//twitter.com/safety/unsafe_link_warning?unsafe_link=https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/)).

Safe Browsing

Sometime around 2019-07-23 it seems that this page,
and *every* page on a \*.bamsoftware.com domain,
got added to the [Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/)
service used by web browsers
to block malware and phishing sites.
[Site status check](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?url=bamsoftware.com),
[block page screenshot](safebrowsing-www.bamsoftware.com-20190724.png).
From a few quick checks, it looks like pages on bamsoftware.com
have been demoted or delisted on the google.com search engine as well.

The Safe Browsing block is a bit annoying,
because it disrupted [Snowflake](https://snowflake.torproject.org/),
a completely unrelated service that happened to use the domain
snowflake-broker.bamsoftware.com, which did not even host any files
but was strictly a web API server.
See [#31230 Firefox addon blocked from agent by Google Safe Browsing service](https://bugs.torproject.org/31230).

The Safe Browsing block seemed to end
on or before
[2019-08-16](transparencyreport.google-www.bamsoftware.com-20190816.png).

Xfinity xFi Protected Browsing

On 2019-11-26, I was informed
by Hooman Mohajeri Moghaddam
that the Comcast Xfinity xFi
["Protected Browsing"](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evm3qk/comcast-blocking-paypal-customers-say-forum-net-neutrality)
feature blocks the bamsoftware.com domain, including this page
([screenshot](xfinity-blockpage.png)).

D std.zip

The D programming language
[made a modification](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20027)
to the [std.zip module](https://dlang.org/library/std/zip.html)
to detect overlapping files.

Apple iOS and iPadOS

Dzmitry Plotnikau sent me a report saying that
a zip bomb could use up all cache storage
on iPhones running iOS 12 and 13, even if only opened using "Quick look."
The exhaustion of storage could have various side effects,
including misbehaving apps, deletion of local cloud files, and OS crashes,
in some cases requiring a factory reset to remedy.
The bug was mitigated in iOS 14.0
(and likely other, contemporaneous point release of iOS and iPadOS).
See [HT211850](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211850)
under the "libarchive" heading.

## A final plea

It's time to put an end to Facebook.
Working there is not ethically neutral:
every day that you go into work, you are doing something wrong.
If you have a Facebook account, delete it.
If you work at Facebook, quit.

And let us not forget that the National Security Agency
must be destroyed.

Package        : unzip
Version        : 6.0-16+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13232
Debian Bug     : 931433

David Fifield discovered a way to construct non-recursive "zip bombs"
that achieve a high compression ratio by overlapping files inside the
zip container. However the output size increases quadratically in the
input size, reaching a compression ratio of over 28 million
(10 MB -> 281 TB) at the limits of the zip format which can cause a
denial-of-service. Mark Adler provided a patch to detect and reject
such zip files for the unzip program.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
6.0-16+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Untrusted zip files should be unpacked in some resource constraining environment, both for memory usage and disk usage.  SUSE currently does not intend to fix this problem. ``` |  |

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* #### [Detect and reject a zip bomb using overlapped entries.](/madler/unzip/commit/47b3ceae397d21bf822bc2ac73052a4b1daf8e1c "Detect and reject a zip bomb using overlapped entries. This detects an invalid zip file that has at least one entry that overlaps with another entry or with the central directory to the end of the file. A Fifield zip bomb uses overlapped local entries to vastly increase the potential inflation ratio. Such an invalid zip file is rejected. See https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/ for David Fifield's analysis, construction, and examples of such zip bombs. The detection maintains a list of covered spans of the zip files so far, where the central directory to the end of the file and any bytes preceding the first entry at zip file offset zero are considered covered initially. Then as each entry is decompressed or tested, it is considered covered. When a new entry is about to be processed, its initial offset is checked to see if it is contained by a covered span. If so, the zip file is rejected as invalid. This commit depends on a preceding commit: \"Fix bug in undefer_input() that misplaced the input state.\"")

package: firefox-esr
version: 60.8.0esr-1
severity: serious

While trying to update firefox-esr in raspbian bullseye I ran into a "possible zip bomb" error. The failure also shows up on the reproducible builds site for i386 and arm64 so it's not raspbian specific.

Please note that this is not necessarily a false positive.
It could be a buggy zipfile as well, like the ones reported here:

<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=931895>

I could ask Mark Adler (patch author) about this one, the same way I
did with the java "false positives", but please provide first a simple
way to reproduce the problem which does not involve building the
entire firefox source package.

Thanks.

Download <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/68.0.1/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-68.0.1.tar.bz2>
Extract it
Unzip omni.ja

The file *is* funky, but afaik it does not have overlapping components.

Hello Mark.

The Debian firefox package no longer builds from source when using the
patched unzip and I'm told this is a "false positive". Is it?

This is the way to reproduce it:

wget <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/68.0.1/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-68.0.1.tar.bz2>
tar xvf firefox-68.0.1.tar.bz2 firefox/omni.ja firefox/browser/omni.ja
unzip firefox/omni.ja
unzip firefox/browser/omni.ja

Thanks.

```

I think I know what's going on here--the Firefox omni.ja file uses an
unusual zip layout, specific to Firefox, that puts the central directory
at the *beginning* of the file, rather than the end. This is meant to
allow for better disk caching when unpacking omni.ja, or something.
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=559961>
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=589368>

You can see in this code sample, first Firefox looks for the central
directory at offset 4, then falls back to the usual EOCD search.
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/af29567ecdba/modules/libjar/nsZipArchive.cpp#l597>
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/af29567ecdba/modules/libjar/nsZipArchive.cpp#l638>

You can see this in the output of "zipinfo" as well; the central
directory is at offset 4, and it shows warning relating to the unusual
layout. (I'm using zipinfo 6.0-21+deb9u1 from Buster, which hasn't been
patched yet.)
	$ zipinfo -v /usr/lib/firefox-esr/omni.ja
	  The central directory is 111932 (000000000001B53Ch) bytes long,
	  and its (expected) offset in bytes from the beginning of the zipfile
	  is 4 (0000000000000004h).

	warning [/usr/lib/firefox-esr/omni.ja]:  16789751 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile
	  (attempting to process anyway)
	error [/usr/lib/firefox-esr/omni.ja]:  reported length of central directory is
	  -16789751 bytes too long (Atari STZip zipfile?  J.H.Holm ZIPSPLIT 1.1
	  zipfile?).  Compensating...

The unzip patch starts by initializing a cover that extends from the
beginning of the central directory to the end of the file. In the case
of the Firefox layout, that's the *entire* file, except for the first 4
bytes. So while none of the file overlap each other, they all appear to
overlap the central directory.
<https://github.com/madler/unzip/commit/47b3ceae397d21bf822bc2ac73052a4b1daf8e1c#diff-42593f5e58d2da2cb6b6a937a04e16ddR496>

The Firefox layout has also caused problems with 7-Zip:
<https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3065694&group_id=14481&atid=114481>

One possible solution is to adjust the bomb-cover patch so it only
covers the actual length of the central directory (and the EOCD)
separately. In almost all normal zip files, these two structures will be
adjacent, so the effect will be the same as now.

```

All,

Thank you Santiago for the report and David for the diagnosis. Though this is not a valid zip file, there are in fact no overlapping structures and so there should not be a bomb alert.

I have added a commit that initializes the cover with the actual spans of the central directory, the Zip64 end of central directory record if present, and the end of central directory record (the latter of which may include the Zip64 end of central directory locator). unzip then processes the funky omni.ja file without a bomb alert.

See:

    <https://github.com/madler/unzip/commit/6d351831be705cc26d897db44f878a978f4138fc>

This is the README file for the 20 April 2009 public release of the
Info-ZIP group's portable UnZip zipfile-extraction program (and related
utilities).

unzip60.zip       portable UnZip, version 6.0, source code distribution
unzip60.tar.Z     same as above, but compress'd tar format
unzip60.tar.gz    same as above, but gzip'd tar format

__________________________________________________________________________

BEFORE YOU ASK:  UnZip, its companion utility Zip, and related utilities
and support files can be found in many places; read the file "WHERE" for
further details.  To contact the authors with suggestions, bug reports,
or fixes, continue reading this file (README) and, if this is part of a
source distribution, the file "ZipPorts" in the proginfo directory.  Also
in source distributions:  read "BUGS" for a list of known bugs, non-bugs
and possible future bugs; INSTALL for instructions on how to build UnZip;
and "Contents" for a commented listing of all the distributed files.
__________________________________________________________________________

GENERAL INFO
------------
UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip format (also
called "zipfiles").  Although highly compatible both with PKWARE's PKZIP
and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, our
primary objectives have been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.

This version of UnZip has been ported to a stupendous array of hardware--
from micros to supercomputers--and operating systems:  Unix (many flavors),
VMS, OS/2 (including DLL version), Windows NT and Windows 95 (including DLL
version), Windows CE (GUI version), Windows 3.x (including DLL version),
MS-DOS, AmigaDOS, Atari TOS, Acorn RISC OS, BeOS, Macintosh (GUI version),
SMS/QDOS, MVS, VM/CMS, FlexOS, Tandem NSK, Human68k (mostly), AOS/VS (partly)
and TOPS-20 (partly).  UnZip features not found in PKUNZIP include source
code; default extraction of directory trees (with a switch to defeat this,
rather than the reverse); system-specific extended file attributes; and, of
course, the ability to run under most of your favorite operating systems.
Plus, it's free. :-)

For source distributions, see the main Contents file for a list of what's
included, and read INSTALL for instructions on compiling (including OS-
specific comments).  The individual operating systems' Contents files (for
example, vms/Contents) may list important compilation info in addition to
explaining what files are what, so be sure to read them.  Some of the ports
have their own, special README files, so be sure to look for those, too.

See unzip.1 or unzip.txt for usage (or the corresponding UnZipSFX, ZipInfo,
fUnZip and ZipGrep docs).  For VMS, unzip_def.rnh or unzip_cli.help may be
compiled into unzip.hlp and installed as a normal VMS help entry; see
vms/descrip.mms.

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------------------------
UnZip 6.0 finally supports nowadays "large" files of sizes > 2 GiB!
This is the first release containing support for the PKWARE Zip64
enhancements.
Major changes are:
   - Support PKWARE ZIP64 extensions, allowing Zip archives and Zip archive
     entries larger than 4 GiBytes and more than 65536 entries within a single
     Zip archive. This support is currently only available for Unix,
     OpenVMS and Win32/Win64.
   - Support for bzip2 compression method.
   - Support for UTF-8 encoded entry names, both through PKWARE's "General
     Purpose Flags Bit 11" indicator and Info-ZIP's new "up" unicode path
     extra field.  (Currently, on Windows the UTF-8 handling is limited to
     the character subset contained in the configured non-unicode "system
     code page".)
   - Added "wrong implementation used" warning to error messages of the MSDOS
     port when used under Win32, in an attempt to reduce false bug reports.
   - Fixed "Time of Creation/Time of Use" vulnerability when setting attributes
     of extracted files, for Unix and Unix-like ports.
   - Fixed memory leak when processing invalid deflated data.
   - Fixed long-standing bug in unshrink (partial_clear), added boundary checks
     against invalid compressed data.
   - On Unix, keep inherited SGID attribute bit for extracted directories
     unless restoration of owner/group id or SUID/SGID/Tacky attributes was
     requested.
   - On Unix, allow extracted filenames to contain embedded control characters
     when explicitly requested by specifying the new command line option "-^".
   - On Unix, support restoration of symbolic link attributes.
   - On Unix, support restoration of 32-bit UID/GID data using the new "ux"
     IZUNIX3 extra field introduced with Zip 3.0.
   - Support for ODS5 extended filename syntax on new OpenVMS systems.
   - Support symbolic links zipped up on VMS.
   - On VMS (only 8.x or better), support symbolic link creation.
   - On VMS, support option to create converted text files in Stream_LF format.
   - New -D option to suppress restoration of timestamps for extracted
     directory entries (on those ports that support setting of directory
     timestamps).  By specifying "-DD", this new option also allows to suppress
     timestamp restoration for ALL extracted files on all UnZip ports which
     support restoration of timestamps.
     On VMS, the default behaviour is now to skip restoration of directory
     timestamps; here, "--D" restores ALL timestamps, "-D" restores none.
   - On OS/2, Win32, and Unix, the (previously optional) feature UNIXBACKUP
     to allow saving backup copies of overwritten files on extraction is now
     enabled by default.

For the UnZip 6.0 release, we want to give special credit to Myles Bennet,
who started the job of supporting ZIP64 extensions and Large-File (> 2GiB)
and provided a first (alpha-state) port.

The 5.52 maintenance release fixes a few minor problems found in the 5.51
release, closes some more security holes, adds a new AtheOS port, and
contains a Win32 extra-field code cleanup that was not finished earlier.
The most important changes are:

   - (re)enabled unshrinking support by default, the LZW patents have expired
   - fixed an extraction size bug for encrypted stored entries (12 excess bytes
     were written with 5.51)
   - fixed false "uncompressed size mismatch" messages when extracting
     encrypted archive entries
   - do not restore SUID/SGID/Tacky attribute bits on Unix (BeOS, AtheOS)
     unless explicitely requested by new "-K" command line qualifier
   - optional support for "-W" qualifier to modify the pattern matching syntax
     (with -W: "*" stops at directory delimiter, "**" matches unlimited)
   - prevent buffer overflow caused by bogus extra-long Zipfile specification
   - performance enhancements for VMS port
   - fixed windll interface handling of its extraction mode qualifiers
     nfflag, ExtractOnlyNewer, noflag, PromptToOverwrite; added detailed
     explanation of their meanings and interactions to the windll documentation

The 5.51 maintenance release adds a command-line CE port, intended for
batch processing. With the integration of this port, the pUnZip port
has been revised and "revitalized".
The most important changes for the general public are a number of
bug fixes, mostly related to security issues:

   - repair a serious bug in the textmode output conversion code for the 16-bit
     ports (16-bit MSDOS, OS/2 1.x, some variants of AMIGA, possibly others)
     which was introduced by the Deflate64 support of release 5.5
   - fix a long standing bug in the the inflate decompression method that
     prevented correct extraction in some rare cases
   - fixed holes in parent dir traversal security code (e.g.: ".^C." slipped
     through the previous version of the check code)
   - fixed security hole: check naming consistency in local and central header
   - fixed security hole: prevent extracted symlinks from redirecting file
     extraction paths

The main addition in the 5.5 release is support for PKWARE's new Deflate64(tm)
algorithm, which appeared first in PKZIP 4.0 (published November 2000).
As usual, some other bugfixes and clean-ups have been integrated:

   - support for Deflate64 (Zip compression method #9)
   - support for extracting VMS variable length record text files on
     any system
   - optional "cheap autorun" feature for the SFX stub
   - security fixes:
     * strip leading slash from stored pathspecs,
     * remove "../" parent dir path components from extracted file names
   - new option "-:" to allow verbatim extraction of file names containing
     "../" parent dir path specs
   - fixed file handle leak for the DLL code
   - repaired OS2 & WinNT ACL extraction which was broken in 5.42

The 5.42 maintenance release fixes more bugs and cleans up the redistribution
conditions:

   - removal of unreduce.c and amiga/timelib.c code to get rid of the last
     distribution restrictions beyond the BSD-like Info-ZIP LICENSE
   - new generic timelib replacement (currently used by AMIGA port)
   - more reasonable mapping rules of UNIX "leading-dot" filenames to the
     DOS 8.3 name convention
   - repaired screensize detection in MORE paging code
     (was broken for DOS/OS2/WIN32 in 5.41)

The 5.41 maintenance release adds another new port and fixes some bugs.

   - new BSD-like LICENSE
   - new Novell Netware NLM port
   - supports extraction of archives with more than 64k entries
   - attribute handling of VMS port was broken in UnZip 5.4
   - decryption support integrated in the main source distribution

The 5.4 release adds new ports, again. Other important items are changes
to the listing format, new supplemental features and several bug fixes
(especially concerning time-stamp handling...):

   - new IBM OS/390 port, a UNIX derivate (POSIX with EBCDIC charset)
   - complete revision of the MacOS port
   - changed listing formats to enlarge the file size fields for more digits
   - added capability to restore directory attributes on MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32
   - enabled support of symbolic links on BeOS
   - Unix: optional Acorn filetype support, useful for volumes exported via NFS
   - several changes/additions to the DLL API
   - GUI SFX stub for Win16 (Windows 3.1) and Win32 (Windows 9x, Windows NT)
   - new free GCC compiler environments supported on WIN32
   - many time-zone handling bug fixes for WIN32, AMIGA, ...

The 5.32 release adds two new ports and a fix for at least one relatively
serious bug:

   - new FlexOS port
   - new Tandem NSK port
   - new Visual BASIC support (compatibility with the Windows DLLs)
   - new -T option (set zipfile timestamp) for virtually all ports
   - fix for timestamps beyond 2038 (e.g., 2097; crashed under DOS/Win95/NT)
   - fix for undetected "dangling" symbolic links (i.e., no pointee)
   - fix for VMS indexed-file extraction problem (stored with Zip 2.0 or 2.1)
   - further performance optimizations

The 5.31 release included nothing but small bug-fixes and typo corrections,
with the exception of some minor performance tweaks.

The 5.3 release added still more ports and more cross-platform portability
features:

   - new BeOS port
   - new SMS/QDOS port
   - new Windows CE graphical port
   - VM/CMS port fully updated and tested
   - MVS port fully updated and tested
   - updated Windows DLL port, with WiZ GUI spun off to a separate package
   - full Universal Time (UTC or GMT) support for trans-timezone consistency
   - cross-platform support for 8-bit characters (ISO Latin-1, OEM code pages)
   - support for NT security descriptors (ACLs)
   - support for overwriting OS/2 directory EAs if -o option given
   - updated Solaris/SVR4 package facility

What is (still!) not added is multi-part archive support (a.k.a. "diskette
spanning", though we really mean archive splitting and not the old diskette
spanning) and a unified and more powerful DLL interface.  These are the two
highest priorities for the 6.x releases.  Work on the former is almost
certain to have commenced by the time you read this.  This time we mean it!
You betcha. :-)

Although the DLLs are still basically a mess, the Windows DLLs (16- and 32-
bit) now have some documentation and a small example application.  Note that
they should now be compatible with C/C++, Visual BASIC and Delphi.  Weirder
languages (FoxBase, etc.) are probably Right Out.

INTERNET RESOURCES
------------------

Info-ZIP's web site is at <http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/>
and contains the most up-to-date information about coming releases,
links to binaries, and common problems.
(See <http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/FAQ.html> for the latter.)
Files may also be retrieved via ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/ .
Thanks to LEO (Munich, Germany) for previously hosting our primary site.

DISTRIBUTION
------------
If you have a question regarding redistribution of Info-ZIP software, either
as is, as packaging for a commercial product, or as an integral part of a
commercial product, please read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section
of the included COPYING file.  All Info-ZIP releases are now covered by
the Info-ZIP license.  See the file LICENSE.  The most current license
should be available at <http://www.info-zip.org/license.html> and
ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html.

Insofar as C compilers are rare on some platforms and the authors only have
direct access to a subset of the supported systems, others may wish to pro-
vide ready-to-run executables for new systems.  In general there is no prob-
lem with this; we require only that such distributions include this README
file, the WHERE file, the LICENSE file (contains copyright/redistribution
information), and the appropriate documentation files (unzip.txt and/or
unzip.1 for UnZip, etc.).  If the local system provides a way to make self-
extracting archives in which both the executables and text files can be
stored together, that's best (in particular, use UnZipSFX if at all possible,
even if it's a few kilobytes bigger than the alternatives); otherwise we
suggest a bare UnZip executable and a separate zipfile containing the re-
maining text and binary files.  If another archiving method is in common
use on the target system (for example, Zoo or LHa), that may also be used.

BUGS AND NEW PORTS:  CONTACTING INFO-ZIP
----------------------------------------
All bug reports and patches (context diffs only, please!) should be
submitted either through the new Info-ZIP Discussion Forum at
<http://www.info-zip.org/board/board.pl> or through the Info-ZIP SourceForge
site at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/infozip/>.  The forum allows file
attachments while SourceForge provides a place to post patches.  The old
Zip-Bugs@lists.wku.edu e-mail address for the Info-ZIP authors was
discontinued after heavy continuous spam, as was the QuickTopic discussion
forum.  The above methods are public, but we also can be reached directly
using the web reply page at <http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html>.  If you
need to send us files privately, contact us first for instructions.

"Dumb questions" that aren't adequately answered in the documentation
should also be directed to Zip-Bugs rather than to a global forum such
as Usenet.  (Kindly make certain that your question *isn't* answered by
the documentation, however--a great deal of effort has gone into making
it clear and complete.)

Suggestions for new features can be discussed on the new Discussion Forum.
A new mailing list for Info-ZIP beta testers and interested parties may
be created someday, but for now any issues found in the betas should use
the forum.  We make no promises to act on all suggestions or even all
patches, but if it is something that is manifestly useful, sending the
required patches to Zip-Bugs directly (as per the instructions in the
ZipPorts file) is likely to produce a quicker response than asking us to
do it--the authors are always ridiculously short on time.  (Please do
NOT send patches or encoded zipfiles to the Info-ZIP list.  Please DO
read the ZipPorts file before sending any large patch.  It would be
difficult to over-emphasize this point...)

If you are considering a port, not only should you read the ZipPorts file,
but also please check in with Zip-Bugs BEFORE getting started, since the
code is constantly being updated behind the scenes.  (For example, VxWorks,
VMOS and Netware ports were once claimed to be under construction, although
we have yet to see any up-to-date patches.)  We will arrange to send you the
latest sources.  The alternative is the possibility that your hard work will
be tucked away in a subdirectory and mostly ignored, or completely ignored
if someone else has already done the port (and you'd be surprised how often
this has happened).

BETA TESTING:  JOINING INFO-ZIP
-------------------------------
If you'd like to keep up to date with our UnZip (and companion Zip utility)
development, join the ranks of beta testers, add your own thoughts and
contributions, or simply lurk, you may join one of our mailing lists.
There is an announcements-only list (Info-ZIP-announce) and a general
discussion/testing list (Info-ZIP). You must be a subscriber to post, and
you can subscribe via the links on our Frequently Asked Questions page:

        <http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/FAQ.html#lists>

(Please note that as of late May 2004, the lists are unavailable pending
a move to a new site; we hope to have them restored shortly.  In the
interim ...)  Feel free to use our bug-reporting web page for bug reports
and to ask questions not answered on the FAQ page above:

        <http://www.info-zip.org/zip-bug.html>

For now the best option is to monitor and contribute to the various threads
on the new discussion forum site at:

      <http://www.info-zip.org/board/board.pl>

The second best way to contribute is through the various features at
SourceForge, such as the bug posting areas.

There is also a closed mailing list for internal discussions of our core
development team. This list is now kept secret to prevent us from being
flooded with spam messages.

-- Greg Roelofs (sometimes known as Cave Newt), principal UnZip developer
   guy, with inspiration from David Kirschbaum, was Author of this text.

-- Christian Spieler (shorthand: SPC), current UnZip maintenance coordinator,
   applied the most recent changes, with Ed Gordon providing a few additions.
