**Describe the bug**

A path traversal vulnerability exists in RestoreTask.java from package ghidra.app.plugin.core.archive. This vulnerability allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files in the system. To achieve arbitrary code execution, one of the solutions is to overwrite some critical ghidra modules, e.g., decompile module (In this case we need to know the installation path of ghidra).

**To Reproduce**

1. Load the malicious project.
2. malicious code will be executed when the decompile module is called.

**Expected behavior**

Here is a demo of the attack behavior.

<https://youtu.be/RGqQMUd9hZM>

**Environment (please complete the following information):**

* OS: All systems
* Ghidra Version: until v9.0.4

**Remark**

The vulnerability was found by researchers from GTISC@Georgia Tech.

## Do Not Trust! Ghidra Arbitrary Command Execution Through Project Sharing

Posted on
2019-07-15

Archiving the intermediate analysis result and sharing with other researchers is a common practice in the field of binary analysis. Popular disassemblers such as IDA and Ghidra also provide the project archiving functionality to help researchers communicating their results. However, it turns out that such project sharing is not secure (at all). For example, researchers have found that an XXE vulnerability existed in the project parsing logic of Ghidra, which can be abused to achieve arbitrary file read or even command execution on a particular platform(i.e., Windows). In this post, we are presenting an even more powerful exploit chain discovered in Ghidra, which can be exploited via a malicious project archive to execute arbitrary code in the victim machine no matter what platform he is using.

## Vulnerablity Description

A path traversal vulnerability exists in RestoreTask.java from package ghidra.app.plugin.core.archive. This vulnerability allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files on the system. To achieve arbitrary code execution, one of the solutions is to overwrite some critical ghidra modules, e.g., decompile module (In this case we need to know the installation path of ghidra).

## Exploit Analysis

The arbitrary code execution exploit chain consists of two nodes. The first node overwrites arbitrary files in the system, and the second node executes the malware containing in the crafted project file.

### Overwrite Arbitrary File

In Ghidra, every project is a jar archive file. When restoring a project, Ghidra will extract the project files and store them in the file system. However, Ghidra doesn‚Äôt check whether the file name of every archive entity is legal or not. By inserting a malicious binary with a file name starting with **../**, attackers are able to let ghidra overwrite arbitrary files on the system.

The vulnerability locates at Ghidra/Features/Base/src/main/java/ghidra/app/plugin/core/archive/RestoreTask.java
The **unjarArchive** method iterates every file entity in the project archive and stores it on the file system directly using its original filename recording in the archive.

| --- | --- |

### Code Execution

As demonstrated by the following code, the DecompileProcess.java locating in the ghidra.app.decompiler package will executes the **decompile** under GHIDRA\_INSTALL\_DIR/Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/os/YOUR\_ARCH/ folder. This method will be called when ghidra is initiated and start to decompile the binary.

| ``` 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728 ``` | ``` private void setup() throws IOException {    if (disposestate != DisposeState.NOT_DISPOSED) {        throw new IOException("Decompiler has been disposed");    }    if (nativeProcess != null) {        // Something bad happened to the process or the interface        // and now we try to restart                    nativeProcess.destroy(); // Make sure previous bad process is killed                            nativeProcess = null;    }    if (exepath == null) {        throw new IOException("Could not find decompiler executable");    }    try {        nativeProcess = runtime.exec(exepath);        nativeIn = nativeProcess.getInputStream();        nativeOut = nativeProcess.getOutputStream();        statusGood = true;    }    catch (IOException e) {        disposestate = DisposeState.DISPOSED_ON_STARTUP_FAILURE;        statusGood = false;        Msg.showError(this, null, "Problem launching decompiler",            "Please report this stack trace to the Ghidra Team", e);        throw e;    }} ``` |

> * *Emulator*. Added improved emulation support at the API level including a simplified API exposed via the EmulatorHelper class. Sample GhidraScripts, which utilize this API, have been provided. (GT-3066)
> * *Function Graph*. Updated the Function Graph to show the current program selection when zoomed out. (GT-2735)
> * *Function Graph*. Added an option to the Function Graph to allow more complex edge routing that will go around non-incident vertices. See the Tool Options for more information and to enable this feature. (GT-3019, Issue #811)
> * *Function Graph*. Fixed Function Graph edge layout bugs that caused some edges to get clipped by vertices. (GT-3161)
> * *GUI*. Added listener to Script Table Chooser Dialog that will get notified when the dialog closes. (GT-2216)
> * *GUI*. Fixed global Tool **auto-save** option so that it persists between Ghidra sessions. (GT-2818, Issue #231)
> * *GUI*. Added the **apple.laf.useScreenmenuBar** option to hoist the menu bar out of the window on macOS. The option is off by default but can be activated in **support/launch.properties**. (GT-2859, Issue #562)
> * *GUI*. Updated the **Repeat Text Search**/**Repeat Memory Search** menu items to show the search dialog for long searches. (GT-2872, Issue #585)
> * *GUI*. Updated Structure Editor to allow user key bindings to work. (GT-2894, Issue #504)
> * *GUI*. Python interpreter key bindings for sending reset and interrupt commands are now configurable. (GT-2901, Issue #588)
> * *GUI*. Tweaked default graphic settings in **support/launch.properties** to support a wider range of displays out-of-the-box. (GT-2913, Issue #341)
> * *GUI*. Added the ability to assign key bindings to activate individual component providers. (GT-2925, Issue #539)
> * *GUI*. Fixed rendering issue in the Search Results table's **Preview** column. (GT-2942, Issue #550)
> * *GUI*. Updated the Function Signature Editor's **Data Type Chooser** dialog to allow for keyboard navigation. (GT-3110, Issue #636)
> * *GUI*. Fixed NullPointerException in the DB Viewer component. (GT-3163, Issue #1023)
