{
  "cveId": "CVE-2019-13398",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being passed directly to shell commands, specifically `sed`, within CGI scripts of the FortiCam's web interface.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],

    "attackVectors": [
      "Web interface",
       "CGI scripts"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to have administrative access to the web interface of the FortiCam device to exploit this vulnerability."
