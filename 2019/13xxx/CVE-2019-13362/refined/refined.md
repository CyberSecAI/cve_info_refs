The provided content is related to CVE-2019-13362.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `codedoc_strlcpy` function, located in `codedoc.c:144`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `codedoc_strlcpy` function does not properly check the size of the input data when copying it into a stack allocated buffer leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: The stack-buffer-overflow can allow an attacker to overwrite the return address on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of Service: Overwriting other stack allocated variables can cause a program crash. In this case, a stack smashing protection was triggered.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input file to `codedoc` via the command line.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted input file to the `codedoc` program, which is likely a local attack vector.
