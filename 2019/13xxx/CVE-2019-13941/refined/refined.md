Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Siemens OZW web server uses predictable path names for project files that are created by legitimate users when using the application's export function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure (CWE-552):** The vulnerability lies in the predictable nature of the file paths used to store exported project files. This allows an attacker to guess the file location.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The web server does not require authentication to access these files when accessed through a specific URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to download project files, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Compromised Confidentiality:** The confidentiality of the targeted system is compromised by the unauthorized access to project files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
*   **Specific URL:** The attacker must craft a specific URL that targets the predictable path of the project files.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected OZW web server.
*   No special privileges are required on the target system or network.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the predictable naming scheme for the files exported by the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Siemens OZW672 and OZW772 web servers, all versions prior to 10.0.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3.
*   Siemens has released version 10.00 of the OZW web server to address the vulnerability.
*   Workarounds include hardening the OZW configuration, restricting access to the device to internal or VPN networks and restricting access to the web server to trusted IP addresses.
