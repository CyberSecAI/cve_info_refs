Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `Helper::temporaryMountDevice()` function in `deepin-clone` using a predictable path `/tmp/.deepin-clone/mount/<block-dev-basename>` to temporarily mount a file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Mount Path:** The function uses a fixed, predictable path in `/tmp` for mounting, making it susceptible to symlink attacks.
*   **Symlink Following:** The application follows symlinks when mounting at this predictable location.
*   **Race Condition:** An attacker can exploit a race condition by creating a symlink at the mount point before the application attempts to mount a filesystem, which can prevent the subsequent unmount.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File System Mount:** An attacker can cause a file system to be permanently mounted at an arbitrary location in the file system, leading to potential data corruption or other system issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerable code by running `deepin-clone -i /dev/sdX`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create symlinks in `/tmp`.
*   The attacker must be able to execute the `deepin-clone` command with appropriate arguments.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in `deepin-clone` version 1.1.3, where the mount point has been moved to `/run/user/$UID`.
*   The issues were discovered as part of a security review of the polkit privileges used by the `deepin-clone` application.
*   The fix involves moving temporary files from `/tmp` to more secure locations like `/var/log` and `/run/user/$UID`.
*   This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2019-13227, CVE-2019-13229, and CVE-2019-13228, which were also found in deepin-clone, related to symlink attacks.
