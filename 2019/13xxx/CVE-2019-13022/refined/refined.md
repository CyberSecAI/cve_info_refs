The provided content is related to CVE-2019-13022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The JETSELECT application used a weak encryption algorithm for password hashing. The algorithm was a simple XOR function followed by Base64 encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak password hashing algorithm: Using a simple XOR function followed by Base64 encoding to 'encrypt' passwords.
- Exposure of encryption key: The XOR key used was the "=" character, and it was hardcoded.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The weak encryption allowed attackers to easily decrypt stored password hashes, obtaining plaintext passwords.
- This allowed attackers to log into the application's web interface as an administrator.
- With administrative access, attackers could modify network segregation rules and access additional sensitive information such as MySQL credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the `ENCtool.jar` file is needed for source code decompilation and to understand the password hashing algorithm.
- Access to the `/JetSelect/SFC/resources/sfc-general.properties` file is necessary to get the encrypted password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the file system where `ENCtool.jar` and `/JetSelect/SFC/resources/sfc-general.properties` files are located.
- An attacker with low privileged access to the system could gain this access.
- Once they gain access to the mentioned files, they can reverse the encryption using the discovered XOR algorithm.
