# CVE-2019-13033

---

| Vendor | cpe:2.3:a:cisofy |
| --- | --- |
| Product | cpe:2.3:a:cisofy:lynis |
| Vulnerable version(s) | 2.0.0 up to 2.7.5 |
| Version with fix | 3.0.0 |

## Description

---

Sander Bos discovered that the data upload routine in Lynis up to version 2.7.5 may leak information, which allows attackers to retrieve the license key by looking at the process listing.

When defined, the license key can be leaked during the period that a data upload occurs. A local user could monitor the process list to find the license key. The key is part of the parameters provided to cURL. This happens when the --upload is used to upload data to a central system. The specific call happens in the include/data\_upload script.

Although the license key alone does not grant access to system information on a central server, it may be used to upload falsified data, waste system resources, or use up all upload credits.

Affected versions are 2.0.0 up to 2.7.5.

## Mitigation

---

To mitigate this issue, the data now comes from a file instead of a directly visible POST parameter.

## Discoverer and credits

---

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")
* [FontLangProvidesToLangpacks](/wiki/Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks "Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks")
* [golang1.14](/wiki/Changes/golang1.14 "Changes/golang1.14")
* [GCC10](/wiki/Changes/GCC10 "Changes/GCC10")
* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

# CISOfy and Security

We care about your data and trust. Security is our business, and we think it is serious business. Therefore we show some of the extensive security measures we have taken.

## HTTPS

Communications to our web services occur via HTTPS, to ensure privacy and confidentiality of your data. Secure from the beginning is our motto: that is why we only provide our website via HTTPS.

### Technical details

We use an **Extended Validation (EV)** certificate. This means our company details and ownership were checked and validated. TLS is being used, with the preference for **TLSv1.2**. The ciphers used are based on best practices, protecting against well-known attacks. **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** is used to ensure HTTP connections are redirected, and browsers are instructed to use HTTPS instead. We also defined a long expiration date, so browsers will try HTTPS first. The great folks behind SSL Labs gave us a **A+** score.

Session cookies are set the highest level of security (HttpOnly, Secure flag), protecting against CSRF/XSS attacks.

## Continuous auditing

Regular audits, vulnerability and security scans are performed, to test our security defenses. We have security monitoring in place and use our own tooling Lynis Enterprise.

## Secure downloads

All downloads are available via HTTPS, ensuring you download comes from our systems. Additionally we provide a hash (fingerprint) of the download and a digital signature. The hash can be used to validate the integrity of the file. The digital signature validates that we are the ones who released it. We apply these signatures also to our [software repository](https://packages.cisofy.com).

## System hardening

We are experts in system auditing. So we test our environment on a regular basis and apply security controls. This includes system hardening, software patch management, and log reviews.

## Personal information

Although we are interested in our customers, we avoid collecting personal information as much as possible. Only basic information is stored to process trial requests and orders. Payment details are processed by a PCI compliant 3rd party [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

## Deletion of data

When data is no longer, we simply delete it. Hoarding is not our thing, especially not when it comes to sensitive data. We do however make backups. They are encrypted and stored in different undisclosed locations, both online and offline.

## Responsible security disclosure

When you discover an issue with our site or products, we encourage you to use responsible disclosure. We respect your privacy, so you can report issues anonymously. Use security@cisofy.com for reporting any security issues.

**Protect yourself: Don't break the law.**

## Security policies

See our [public security policy](https://github.com/CISOfy/cisofy-security-policy) for more details about how we do security management.

## Thanks

We thank the following people for providing tips and suggestions to make our services more secure.

Package        : lynis
Version        : 1.6.3-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13033
Debian Bug     : #963161

It was discovered that there was a vulnerability in lynis, a security
auditing tool. The license key could be obtained by simple
observation of the process list when a data upload is being
performed.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this issue has been fixed in lynis version
1.6.3-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your lynis packages.
