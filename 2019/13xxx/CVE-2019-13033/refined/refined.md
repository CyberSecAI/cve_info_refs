Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-13033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the data upload routine of Lynis versions up to 2.7.5. Specifically, the license key was included as a parameter passed to cURL during the data upload process (when the `--upload` option was used).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leakage:** The license key was exposed as part of the command-line parameters used by cURL.
- **Lack of Secure Parameter Handling:** The application didn't use secure methods to handle sensitive data like the license key during data uploads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **License Key Exposure:** A local user with the ability to view process lists could obtain the license key.
- **Potential for Falsified Data Uploads:** While the license key itself doesn't grant access to system information on the central server, it could be used to upload falsified data.
- **Resource Wastage:** Attackers could exploit the license key to waste system resources or deplete upload credits.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Process Monitoring:** A local user on the machine running Lynis could monitor the process list while the data upload command is being executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the system running Lynis.
- **Process Monitoring Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to view the process list on the system.
- **Knowledge of data upload:** The attacker must know when the data upload occurs to monitor the process list.

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by changing the method of passing the license key. Instead of being a directly visible POST parameter, the data is now read from a file.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix was implemented in Lynis version 3.0.0
- The vulnerability affects Lynis versions 2.0.0 to 2.7.5
- The vulnerability was discovered by Sander Bos.
