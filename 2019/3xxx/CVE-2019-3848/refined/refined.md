Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-3848:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks before loading event information into the calendar's edit event modal popup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate access control: The application failed to verify if a user had the necessary permissions to view calendar events. This allowed unauthorized users to access event details.
- Information Disclosure: Due to the missing permission checks, logged-in non-guest users could view calendar events that were not intended for them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized information disclosure: Attackers could gain read-only access to calendar events they were not authorized to see.
- Potential for sensitive information leakage: If calendar events contained sensitive information, this information could be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access: The vulnerability is exploitable by any logged-in non-guest user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in, non-guest user on the Moodle platform.
- No special privileges are required beyond a basic authenticated user account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The access was read-only, meaning users could not edit the events, but could view their contents.
- The vulnerability affected Moodle versions 3.6 to 3.6.2, 3.5 to 3.5.4, and 3.4 to 3.4.7.
- It was fixed in versions 3.6.3, 3.5.5, and 3.4.8.
- The vulnerability was reported by Juan Leyva.
- The associated Moodle tracker issue is MDL-64830.
