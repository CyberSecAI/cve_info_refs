Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-3806:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how PowerDNS Recursor handles Lua hooks when configured to distribute queries across multiple threads. Specifically, when the `pdns-distributes-queries` setting is enabled (`yes`) and the number of threads is greater than one (`threads=X`), the Lua script is not properly loaded into the thread responsible for handling incoming TCP queries. This prevents the Lua hooks from being applied to those queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Thread Handling:** The core issue is the misconfiguration of how Lua scripts are loaded within the multithreaded environment of PowerDNS Recursor, where the Lua script context is not correctly applied to the thread handling TCP queries.
- **Bypass of Lua Hooks:**  Lua hooks are designed to enforce security policies. The vulnerability results in these policies being bypassed for TCP queries under the specified conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access Restriction Bypass:** By bypassing the Lua hooks, an attacker can potentially bypass security policies, leading to unauthorized access or actions. This could mean that filtering or other forms of access control put in place via Lua scripts will not be effective for certain queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **TCP Queries:** The vulnerability is triggered specifically by DNS queries sent over TCP. UDP queries are not affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send TCP queries to the vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor instance.
- **Understanding of Configurations:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable configuration - specifically the server needs to be running with more than one thread and the pdns-distributes-queries needs to be set to yes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.1.4 up to and including 4.1.8.
- Versions 4.0.x, 4.1.0 up to and including 4.1.3 and 4.1.9 are not affected.
- The severity is considered "Low"
- A workaround is provided (setting `pdns-distributes-queries=no`), but upgrading to a non-affected version is recommended.
