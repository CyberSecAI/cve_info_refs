| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157449#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-21 11:01:25 UTC  ``` 199 # create logfiles if missing 200 for i in ./%{chroot}/log/logfile ./%{chroot}/log/jarfile; do 201         if ! test -e $i; then touch $i; chown privoxy: $i; chmod 640 $i ; fi 202 done  allows local privilege escalation. For this a race needs to be won, but I can do that with a 100% success rate by using inotify to watch %{chroot}/log and changing one of the files to a symling to an arbitrary file (e.g. /etc/passwd).  Can you please remove the chown and package the files as usual? ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1157449#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2020-01-24 12:18:14 UTC  ``` Please submit for this.
