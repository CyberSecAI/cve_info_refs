{
  "CVE-2019-3976": {
    "Root cause": "The upgrade package's name field in RouterOS versions 6.45.6 Stable, 6.44.5 Long-term, and below is vulnerable to arbitrary directory creation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Relative Path Traversal",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated user can install a malicious package and create arbitrary directories, potentially enabling the developer shell.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with valid credentials can upload a crafted malicious package.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have valid authentication credentials to access the RouterOS device."
  },
    "CVE-2019-3978": {
        "Root cause": "The lack of sufficient protection of DNS requests and cache allows remote unauthenticated attackers to trigger DNS queries via port 8291.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Insufficient Protections of a Critical Resource",
            "DNS Cache Poisoning"
        ],
        "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can force the router to send DNS queries to an attacker-controlled server, potentially resulting in DNS cache poisoning.",
        "Attack vectors": "Remote unauthenticated attacker can send crafted DNS requests to port 8291 of the RouterOS device.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have network access to the RouterOS device on port 8291."
    },
    "CVE-2019-3979": {
        "Root cause": "Improper DNS response handling, where the router adds all A records to its DNS cache, even if unrelated to the queried domain.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Improper DNS Response Handling",
             "DNS Cache Poisoning"
        ],
        "Impact": "A remote attacker can control a DNS server, which can then poison the router's DNS cache with additional and untrue records.",
        "Attack vectors": "Remote attacker-controlled DNS server sends crafted responses to the RouterOS device.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the DNS server that the RouterOS device is communicating with."
    },
     "CVE-2019-3977": {
        "Root cause": "RouterOS versions 6.45.6 Stable, 6.44.5 Long-term, and below do not sufficiently validate where upgrade packages are downloaded from when using the autoupgrade feature.",
        "Weaknesses": [
             "Insufficient Validation of Upgrade Package's Origin",
             "Lack of proper verification of software source"
        ],
        "Impact": "A remote attacker can trick the router into upgrading to an older RouterOS version, potentially resetting system usernames and passwords.",
        "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger a downgrade by supplying a crafted older version of RouterOS via the autoupgrade feature.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the RouterOS device."
