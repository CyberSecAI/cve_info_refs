Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-3552

**Root Cause:**
The C++ Facebook Thrift servers (using cpp2) did not properly handle messages containing containers with fields of unknown types. Specifically, the code would silently return when encountering a bad type during the skipping of data, instead of throwing an exception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation: The server did not validate the types of fields within containers.
- Lack of error handling: The code did not throw an exception when an invalid type was encountered during the skipping of data.
- Inefficient processing:  When a server encounters invalid data, it might enter a long loop doing nothing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious client could send short messages with containers containing fields of unknown types. The server would then spend a long time processing these messages, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: A malicious client sends crafted messages to the server over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to the vulnerable Thrift server.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the Thrift protocol and be able to craft messages containing invalid field types within containers.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**
- The provided information includes the specific code commit that addresses the issue, highlighting the changes made to throw exceptions when encountering invalid types during the skip operation.
- It also explains that the vulnerability was specifically in C++ Facebook Thrift servers using cpp2.
- The fix also included a test case that verifies that an exception is thrown when skipping a TType::T_STOP in a container which was not handled by the previous code.
- It provides more details about how the issue could lead to a DoS, specifically by causing the server to enter a long loop while attempting to parse invalid data.
