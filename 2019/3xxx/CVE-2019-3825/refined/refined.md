Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3825:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how GDM (GNOME Display Manager) handles timed logins when configured to use X.org. After the timed login timeout expires, the running session could be incorrectly associated with the timed login user rather than the actual user who initiated the session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Session Association:** The core issue is the misassociation of a user's session with the timed login user after the timeout.
- **Lock Screen Bypass:**  This misassociation allows an attacker to bypass the lock screen and gain access to the logged-in user's session by repeatedly attempting to log in as the timed login user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker unauthorized access to an already logged-in user's session. This allows them to potentially view, modify or delete user data and execute commands with the privileges of the compromised user.
- **Confidentiality and Integrity Loss:** Data confidentiality and integrity are at risk due to the attacker's ability to access and manipulate the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is the GDM login screen with timed login enabled and using X.org.
- The attacker must have physical access to the system.
- It involves manipulating the login process by selecting a timed login user and waiting for the timer to expire.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the system where GDM is running.
- **Timed Login Enabled:** Timed logins must be enabled in GDM configuration for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
- **X.org:** The system must be using X.org as its display server, as the issue does not affect Wayland sessions.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability affects the gdm3 package.
- The vulnerability is specific to the X.org display server.
- The vulnerability was fixed in gdm version 3.31.4 and specific package versions for Ubuntu 18.04 and 18.10.
- Red Hat has addressed this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via RHSA-2020:1766.
- The fix involves changes in `daemon/gdm-manager.c` and `daemon/gdm-session.c`.
