| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c0)  Björn Baumbach    2019-03-12 21:17:05 UTC  ``` In source3/smbd/pysmbd.c the set_nt_acl_conn() function calls init_files_struct() which sets:  saved_umask = umask(0);  But the umask(saved_umask) to restore the original umask is missing for the non-error case. This pysmbd code is used by the ntacl-calls for settings the sysvol ACLs.  This leads to world writeable files in the private dir, which have been created by samba-tool domain provision:  openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/lib/samba/private/krb5.conf", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 26 openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/lib/samba/private/dns_update_list", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 26 openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/lib/samba/private/spn_update_list", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 26  root@bb-ubuntu-bio:/var/lib/samba/private# ls -l | grep -- -rw-rw-rw- -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root    3663 Mar 12 16:05 dns_update_list -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root      95 Mar 12 16:05 krb5.conf -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root     955 Mar 12 16:05 spn_update_list  This has been introduced with Samba 4.9 with the commit 747c3f1fb379bb68cc7479501b85741493c05812. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c1)  Björn Baumbach    2019-03-12 21:22:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14923](attachment.cgi?id=14923 "pysmbd patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14923&action=edit "pysmbd patch") pysmbd patch ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c2)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-03-13 23:24:44 UTC  ``` Removing private marker from the patch and description to Joe (who isn't on the team) can work on it.   The while bug is protected by the samba-devel restriction, while also allowing access to those on the CC list. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c3)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-03-14 04:20:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14928](attachment.cgi?id=14928 "Initial advisory") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14928&action=edit "Initial advisory") Initial advisory  I've asked Red Hat Product Security for a CVE. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c4)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-03-14 04:37:07 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 14923](attachment.cgi?id=14923 "pysmbd patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14923&action=edit "pysmbd patch") pysmbd patch  I don't think this patch is quite right, the init_files_struct shouldn't be setting the umask or un-setting it, shouldn't that be in a wrapper be around SMB_VFS_FSET_NT_ACL() in set_nt_acl_conn()?  (As this the routine setting the file permissions). ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c5)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-03-14 05:28:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14929](attachment.cgi?id=14929 "WIP patch for master") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14929&action=edit "WIP patch for master") WIP patch for master  This needs some very careful examination, plus some work to understand exactly which operations we actually need to change the umask for.  However I think it is better and cleaner than the original patch.   TODO:   * Add tests to pin down expected permission behaviour of each pysmbd API, smbd.create_file in particular  * Add integration test for provision (that it doesn't create world-writable files)  * confirm the umask is unchanged after all pysmbd calls. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c6)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-03-14 06:02:17 UTC  ``` I've confirmed both patches work, but frustratingly something is changing the umask in our test system to 0000 so files created by 'make testenv' are still 0666.  This in turn makes it much harder to write tests that prove either patches do what is expected.  This may be a can of worms.  :-( ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c7)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-03-14 06:06:20 UTC  ``` selftest.pl has:   # We need to have no umask limitations for the tests.  umask 0000; ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c8)  Tim Beale    2019-03-15 01:13:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14930](attachment.cgi?id=14930 "Integration test to highlight the problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14930&action=edit "Integration test to highlight the problem") Integration test to highlight the problem  Attached is a integration test that demonstrates the problem. Note that I've skipped checking the file permissions of directories and sockets in private/ - this excludes (along with other dirs) the following, but I'm guessing their  permissions are expected.  timbeale@timbeale-pc:~/code/samba$ ls -l st/ad_dc/private/ total 12488 srwxrwxrwx 1 timbeale timbeale       0 Mar 15 12:53 ldapi drwxr-x--- 2 timbeale timbeale    4096 Mar 15 12:53 ldap_priv drwxr-xr-x 2 timbeale timbeale    4096 Mar 15 12:53 smbd.tmp ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c9)  Tim Beale    2019-03-15 03:06:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14931](attachment.cgi?id=14931 "Unit-style smbd test") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14931&action=edit "Unit-style smbd test") Unit-style smbd test  Attached is test that the individual smbd APIs don't mess with the umask. It seems to work a bit better - it fails without Andrew's patch and passes with it.  The integration test I added earlier still needs some work - I think it needs to set the umask at the start too, but I'm still trying to get my head around what behaviour we should be asserting in that case. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c10)  Tim Beale    2019-03-15 05:17:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 14932](attachment.cgi?id=14932 "Integration test to highlight the problem") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14932&action=edit "Integration test to highlight the problem") Integration test to highlight the problem  I think this test now fails in the bad case and passes in the good case. Updated it to just check there are no world-writable files. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c11)  Andrew Bartlett    2019-03-18 00:14:40 UTC  ``` Can I get some assistance from someone who really understands the smbd internals being used by pysmbd and which actions strictly need umask() changes?  It would be good to get a solid understanding of this area to complement the simpler confirmation that we don't leak the umask() change.  Sadly all I know is that I added the umask() changes originally in:  commit e146fe5ef96c1522175a8e81db15d1e8879e5652 Author: Andrew Bartlett <abartlet@samba.org> Date:   Fri Oct 26 14:22:07 2012 +1100      pysmbd: Set umask to 0 during smbd operations  But I didn't record why they were needed beyond the simple comment about freedom to fully set file permissions:  +        /* we want total control over the permissions on created files, +          so set our umask to 0 */ ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=13834#c12)  Jeremy Allison    2019-03-20 20:08:13 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 14929](attachment.cgi?id=14929 "WIP patch for master") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=14929&action=edit "WIP patch for master") WIP patch for master  Patch isn't complete I think.

**Mitigation**

None

**Detail**

* CVE-2019-3870

  + Severity: Not affected
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 0.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N)
  + A vulnerability was found in Samba from version (including) 4.9 to versions before 4.9.6 and 4.10.2. During the creation of a new Samba AD DC, files are created in a private subdirectory of the install location. This directory is typically mode 0700, that is owner (root) only access. However in some upgraded installations it will have other permissions, such as 0755, because this was the default before Samba 4.8. Within this directory, files are created with mode 0666, which is world-writable, including a sample krb5.conf, and the list of DNS names and servicePrincipalName values to update.
* CVE-2019-3880

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 6.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
  + A flaw was found in the way samba implemented an RPC endpoint emulating the Windows registry service API. An unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to create a new registry hive file anywhere they have unix permissions which could lead to creation of a new file in the Samba share. Versions before 4.8.11, 4.9.6 and 4.10.2 are vulnerable.

## CVE-2019-3870.html:

```

===========================================================
== Subject:     World writable files in Samba AD DC private/ dir
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2019-3870
==
== Versions:    Samba 4.9 and later
==
== Summary:     During the provision of a new Active Directory
                DC, some files in the private/ directory are
		created world-writable.
===========================================================

===========
Description
===========

During the creation of a new Samba AD DC, files are created in a the
private/ subdirectory of our install location.  This directory is
typically mode 0700, that is owner (root) only access.  However in
some upgraded installations it will have other permissions, such as
0755, because this was the default before Samba 4.8.

Within this directory files are created with mode 0666,
that is world-writable, including a sample krb5.conf and the list of
DNS names and servicePrincipalName values to update.

==================
Patch Availability
==================

Patches addressing both these issues have been posted to:

    http://www.samba.org/samba/security/

Additionally, Samba 4.9.6 and 4.10.2 have been issued as security
releases to correct the defect.  Samba administrators are advised to
upgrade to these releases or apply the patch as soon as possible.

==================
CVSSv3 calculation
==================

CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H (6.1)

This score is calculated based on modification to the dns_update_list
or spn_update_list files in a default configuration.

Administrators who rely on these files in other ways might have a
higher score.  For example, the sample krb5.conf might be read as
input to Kerberos tools or used as the system-wide krb5.conf
(potentially via a symlink).

===============================
Required steps (and workaround)
===============================

Upgrading Samba will not change the file or directory permissions for
an existing installation, it will just avoid the issue for new
installations.

Assuming Samba is installed in the default location as root run:

 chmod 0700 /usr/local/samba/private

The private directory can be found in the listing from
 smbd -b| grep PRIVATE_DIR

Alternatively remove world-write permission from any files with:
 chmod o-w /usr/local/samba/private/*

During the creation of a new Samba AD DC, files are created in a the private/ subdirectory of our install location.  This directory is typically mode 0700, that is owner (root) only access.  However in some upgraded installations it will have other permissions, such as 0755, because this was the default before Samba 4.8. Within this directory files are created with mode 0666, that is world-writable, including a sample krb5.conf and the list of DNS names and servicePrincipalName values to update.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1689010#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-03-14 22:14:53 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Björn Baumbach (SerNet)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1689010#c3)  Doran Moppert    2019-03-19 00:01:14 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of samba as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 as they did not include support for Active Directory Domain Controller.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1689010#c5)  Andreas Schneider    2019-04-02 13:20:26 UTC  ``` Looking at the spec file, the pysmbd code is packages in RHEL 7. It is probably not used by anything, but it is there.

See >  > <http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/rpms/samba/tree/samba.spec?h=rhel-7.6#n2042>  We do build pysmbd, but afaict the affected code belongs to python/samba/provision/ which is packaged as python-dc.  python-dc is only built if %{with_dc} is enabled, which is not presently the case on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  We'll file a tracker for Fedora when this goes public.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1689010#c13)  Doran Moppert    2019-04-09 04:05:07 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13834> <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2019-3870.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1689010#c14)  Doran Moppert    2019-04-09 04:05:20 UTC  ``` Created samba tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-29 [[bug 1697718](show_bug.cgi?id=1697718 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3870 samba: World writable files in Samba AD DC private/ dir [fedora-29]")]   ``` |  |
