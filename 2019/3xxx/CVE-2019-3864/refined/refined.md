Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3864:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Quay web GUI uses a `_csrf_token` parameter as a CSRF token. This token was not refreshed on every request, or when a user logged out and logged back in. Additionally, the token was exposed in some endpoints' query strings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insufficient CSRF token rotation:** The CSRF token was not being refreshed with each request or upon user login/logout, making it predictable and reusable.
*   **CSRF token leakage:** The token was exposed in the query string of some endpoints, making it vulnerable to interception and exploitation (e.g., via browser history, web server logs, etc.).

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker could use a leaked CSRF token to perform actions on the Quay system using the account of the victim user. This could lead to unauthorized data modification, access, or other malicious activities, potentially compromising the system's integrity and confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Token interception from query strings:** Attackers can obtain the CSRF token when it is exposed in the URL. This could happen through various means such as:
    *   Monitoring network traffic (Man-in-the-middle attack).
    *   Accessing browser history.
    *   Reading server logs.
*   **Reusing leaked token**: An attacker who obtains the leaked token can then use it to send requests to the application on behalf of the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to somehow obtain a valid CSRF token. This could be done through the attack vectors described above, meaning they would need to have some form of access to the user's web traffic or systems logging web traffic.
*   The attacker can be external, as they don't need to be within the network to obtain the token via network traffic if the user is outside of the network and connected via a non-secured network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by rotating the CSRF token upon every user login. The attempt to refresh on every request was abandoned due to complexities in managing concurrent requests.
*   The introduction of default Same-Site cookies was also noted as a mitigating factor, though it doesn't fully address the core vulnerability.
*   The fix was implemented in `quay-3.0.0`.
