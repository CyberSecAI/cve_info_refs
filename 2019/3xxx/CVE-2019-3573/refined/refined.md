Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Infinite Loop in `sixel2png`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `sixel_decode_raw_impl` function in `fromsixel.c` contains a `while` loop that calculates the required buffer size for the image based on `context->pos_x`, `context->pos_y`, and `context->repeat_count`. The loop's condition `(sx < (context->pos_x + context->repeat_count) || sy < (context->pos_y + 6))` can result in an infinite loop if the initial values of `sx` or `sy` are zero and the calculations do not result in those values increasing. Specifically, the multiplication by two on lines 562 and 563 can fail to resolve if `sx` and `sy` are zero. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper calculation of buffer size, specifically involving multiplication by zero, resulting in infinite loop.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service by hanging the `sixel2png` process.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Providing a specially crafted sixel file (e.g., `infinite_loop_poc1`) as input to `sixel2png`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to provide input to the `sixel2png` utility.

2.  **Heap-Buffer-Overflow in `img2sixel`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `img2sixel` program, when processing certain JPEG files, experiences a heap buffer overflow. The overflow occurs during the `load_jpeg` function call, specifically within the `memmove` operation. This occurs because the loaded image dimensions cause memory to be allocated that is insufficient to store the loaded image data and results in writing past the allocated buffer.
    *   **Weakness:**  Improper bounds checking when allocating memory for the decoded JPEG data.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, leading to program crash (abort) and potentially other undefined behavior.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Providing a malicious JPEG file (e.g., `heap-buffer-overflow-poc2`) as input to the `img2sixel` utility.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious image file as input to the `img2sixel` utility.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information includes detailed backtraces and code snippets, which help pinpoint the locations of the vulnerabilities.
*   The issue report includes links to proof-of-concept (PoC) files that demonstrate the vulnerabilities.
*   The issue report mentions the use of AddressSanitizer (ASan), which confirms the heap-buffer-overflow.
