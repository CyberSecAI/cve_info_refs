| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-08 13:02:56 UTC  ``` A finding from [bug 1150550](show_bug.cgi?id=1150550 "RESOLVED FIXED"): The cron job in /etc/cron.weekly/nagios allows the 'nagios' user to escalate privileges to 'root' by placing symlinks in /var/log/nagios/archives.  The cron job is not performing its logic by default, which is good. Only when NAGIOS_COMPRESS_LOGFILES is set in /etc/sysconfig/nagios. The cron job is a SUSE specific file that is not coming from upstream. To fix it we need to run the relevant commands in the 'nagios' user context e.g. by using 'sudo'.  The exact vulnerability is that the cron job basically calls "/usr/bin/bzip2" on files in /var/log/nagios/archives/*.log. Since both /var/log/nagios and /var/log/nagios/archives are owned by 'nagios', the 'nagios' user can place symlinks there. 'bzip2' contains some sanity checks but uses racy system calls like stat/lstat/open to implement them. The following bad things could happen:  1) A DoS against cron can be implemented e.g. by placing a FIFO in   /var/log/nagios/archives/some.log. bzip2 will then try to open this   FIFO which will block forever. 2) It could be used to deduce file existence of private files, because bzip2   reacts different to a broken symlink than to a valid symlink. The output of   bzip2 is however only mailed to root. Maybe the result could also be   observed by other means by an attacker. 3) When the attacker wins a race against bzip2 then private files could leak.   When replacing the input file by a symlink e.g. to /root/.bash_history then   bzip2 would compress the file and write the result to   /var/log/nagios/archives. This only works if the private file allows group   read or world read, however. 4) It allows to corrupt any files in the system that end on *.log by replacing   the /var/log/nagios/archives directory with a symlink to the directory that   contains the *.log file.  The most serious is probably 3) but the race is difficult to win and since the cron job only runs once a week the attack surface is luckily small.  Since this is a SUSE specific cron job our security team will have to assign a CVE ourselves. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-08 13:40:26 UTC  ``` All codestreams are affected by this, only in SLE-11 does the cron job look a bit different but it has the same basic vulnerability in it. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c2)  Lars Vogdt   2019-11-11 13:05:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 823818](attachment.cgi?id=823818&action=diff "Proposed patch for nagios cronjob") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=823818&action=edit "Proposed patch for nagios cronjob") Proposed patch for nagios cronjob  Attached patch should: 1) try to get the configured nagios_user from the main nagios configuration file 2) fallback to the user 'nagios' if 1) does not lead to a result 3) call the bzip command via 'su --login $NAGIOS_USER --command...' to run as nagios user ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c3)  Lars Vogdt   2019-11-11 13:06:35 UTC  ``` Matthias: would the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c2) solve the issue from your point of view? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-12 09:48:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Lars Vogdt from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c3)) > Matthias: would the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c2) solve the issue from your point of > view?  It will solve the issue. However, I don't recommend to use `su` or `sudo` after all. Discussing this in the security team we found it is better to use `setpriv` instead. The reason for this is that `su` and `sudo` use the PAM stack which can cause side effects or produce undesirable log messages.  A setpriv call for your purpose would look like this:  ``` setpriv --init-groups --ruid $NAGIOS_USER --rgid $NAGIOS_USER \     --inh-caps -all --reset-env /usr/bin/bzip2 "$f" ```  Can you please adjust your patch accoringly? Otherwise it looks good, thank you! ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-12 12:08:58 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2019-3698 for this ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 11:12:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to lars.vogdt@suse.com from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c3)) > Matthias: would the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c2) solve the issue from your point of view?  Lars, have you been able to come up with an adjusted patch, as suggested in [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c4) yet? Can you please submit updates for all codestreams? Thank you. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-02-28 12:15:51 UTC  ``` According to our disclosure policy [1] and the CRD date communicated in [comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c7) the embargo has now ended. I'm publishing this bug, removing the embargo tag. Since I intend to soon add badness to the new rpmlint-check for cron jobs, the nagios package will soon fail to build without a whitelisting, which depends on the bugfix discussed in this bug.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-08 13:02:56 UTC  ``` A finding from [bug 1150550](show_bug.cgi?id=1150550 "RESOLVED FIXED"): The cron job in /etc/cron.weekly/nagios allows the 'nagios' user to escalate privileges to 'root' by placing symlinks in /var/log/nagios/archives.  The cron job is not performing its logic by default, which is good. Only when NAGIOS_COMPRESS_LOGFILES is set in /etc/sysconfig/nagios. The cron job is a SUSE specific file that is not coming from upstream. To fix it we need to run the relevant commands in the 'nagios' user context e.g. by using 'sudo'.  The exact vulnerability is that the cron job basically calls "/usr/bin/bzip2" on files in /var/log/nagios/archives/*.log. Since both /var/log/nagios and /var/log/nagios/archives are owned by 'nagios', the 'nagios' user can place symlinks there. 'bzip2' contains some sanity checks but uses racy system calls like stat/lstat/open to implement them. The following bad things could happen:  1) A DoS against cron can be implemented e.g. by placing a FIFO in   /var/log/nagios/archives/some.log. bzip2 will then try to open this   FIFO which will block forever. 2) It could be used to deduce file existence of private files, because bzip2   reacts different to a broken symlink than to a valid symlink. The output of   bzip2 is however only mailed to root. Maybe the result could also be   observed by other means by an attacker. 3) When the attacker wins a race against bzip2 then private files could leak.   When replacing the input file by a symlink e.g. to /root/.bash_history then   bzip2 would compress the file and write the result to   /var/log/nagios/archives. This only works if the private file allows group   read or world read, however. 4) It allows to corrupt any files in the system that end on *.log by replacing   the /var/log/nagios/archives directory with a symlink to the directory that   contains the *.log file.  The most serious is probably 3) but the race is difficult to win and since the cron job only runs once a week the attack surface is luckily small.  Since this is a SUSE specific cron job our security team will have to assign a CVE ourselves. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-08 13:40:26 UTC  ``` All codestreams are affected by this, only in SLE-11 does the cron job look a bit different but it has the same basic vulnerability in it. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c2)  Lars Vogdt   2019-11-11 13:05:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 823818](attachment.cgi?id=823818&action=diff "Proposed patch for nagios cronjob") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=823818&action=edit "Proposed patch for nagios cronjob") Proposed patch for nagios cronjob  Attached patch should: 1) try to get the configured nagios_user from the main nagios configuration file 2) fallback to the user 'nagios' if 1) does not lead to a result 3) call the bzip command via 'su --login $NAGIOS_USER --command...' to run as nagios user ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c3)  Lars Vogdt   2019-11-11 13:06:35 UTC  ``` Matthias: would the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c2) solve the issue from your point of view? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-12 09:48:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Lars Vogdt from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c3)) > Matthias: would the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c2) solve the issue from your point of > view?  It will solve the issue. However, I don't recommend to use `su` or `sudo` after all. Discussing this in the security team we found it is better to use `setpriv` instead. The reason for this is that `su` and `sudo` use the PAM stack which can cause side effects or produce undesirable log messages.  A setpriv call for your purpose would look like this:  ``` setpriv --init-groups --ruid $NAGIOS_USER --rgid $NAGIOS_USER \     --inh-caps -all --reset-env /usr/bin/bzip2 "$f" ```  Can you please adjust your patch accoringly? Otherwise it looks good, thank you! ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-12 12:08:58 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2019-3698 for this ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 11:12:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to lars.vogdt@suse.com from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c3)) > Matthias: would the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c2) solve the issue from your point of view?

Thank you. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-02-28 12:15:51 UTC  ``` According to our disclosure policy [1] and the CRD date communicated in [comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1156309#c7) the embargo has now ended. I'm publishing this bug, removing the embargo tag. Since I intend to soon add badness to the new rpmlint-check for cron jobs, the nagios package will soon fail to build without a whitelisting, which depends on the bugfix discussed in this bug.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c0)  Thomas Wagner   2017-03-10 21:41:04 UTC  ``` I installed nagios 4.3.1 in Leap 42.2 from server:monitoring. During installation an empty folder /var/spool/nagios is created. Upon first start of nagios the named pipe /var/spool/nagios is created with user "nagios" and group "nagios". However, it should be created as group "nagcmd" in order to allow control of nagios via the webinterface (like re-sheduling a check). ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c1)  Lars Vogdt   2017-03-30 09:48:16 UTC  ``` Please see my comment in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/478635> - this is not the right fix for your problem. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c2)  Lars Vogdt   2017-03-30 10:53:36 UTC  ``` @Ansgar: I like to leave the final decision to you as I'm just co-maintainer for openSUSE here.   Always allowing the nagcmd group to write into this file might not be the best idea from my pow. Especially as "check_external_commands" might be disabled in the nagios configuration. I did not check, yet, what happens if "someone" writes into the pipe regardless of the configuration settings... ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c3)  Ansgar Esztermann   2018-10-02 08:54:46 UTC  ``` Upstream installs $CHECKRESULTDIR with setgid $command_grp (so when nagios creates the named pipe, it is owned by group nagcmd automatically), but we don't.  Unless there's some compelling reason not to, I'd prefer reverting to upstream behaviour here. However, this must not be done in %post. Instead, the %attr entry needs to be changed. If there are no objections, I'll create an SR. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c4)  Lars Vogdt   2018-10-02 11:28:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ansgar Esztermann from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c3)) > Upstream installs $CHECKRESULTDIR with setgid $command_grp (so when nagios > creates the named pipe, it is owned by group nagcmd automatically), but we > don't. >  > Unless there's some compelling reason not to, I'd prefer reverting to > upstream behaviour here. However, this must not be done in %post. Instead, > the %attr entry needs to be changed. If there are no objections, I'll create > an SR.  Absolutely fine with me.   Let's add security here to also have a look and give their ok. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c5)  Lars Vogdt   2018-10-02 11:34:09 UTC  ``` JFYI from the changelog:  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Fri Jul  8 11:35:37 UTC 2011 - lars@linux-schulserver.de  - removed setuid bit from /var/spool/nagios - configure the    right permissions on service start instead  --------------------------------------------------------------------  From my memory: setting the setguid (I assume the "setuid" in the changes file is a typo) bit for the directory would allow any application in the nagioscmd group to write into this directory.   While this might be wanted for most systems, the current "default" is a bit more secure as it only allows the nagios daemon itself to write into the directory.   Using a permissions file, that allows to adapt the permissions for the directory, might be a possible solution here that allows a very secure standard installation while informed users could change the setup via the permission file (and calling "chkstat --system --set"). ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2018-10-04 13:09:00 UTC  ``` moving to audits ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c7)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-04 13:37:38 UTC  ``` I will look at this ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-12 07:12:50 UTC  ``` So I checked this and setting the directory to setgid is an acceptable solution. If check_external_commands is disabled then the code checks for this and doesn't open the pipe. Separating the group for the daemon from the group that is allowed to run commands is a good idea. The "chkstat --system --set" workaround is too annoying to users as a permanent solution.  While checking this I also had a (brief) look at some of the external commands (we don't package them), but they look good to me. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c9)  Lars Vogdt   2018-10-12 09:06:32 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1028975#c8)) > So I checked this and setting the directory to setgid is an acceptable > solution.

The "chkstat --system > --set" workaround is too annoying to users as a permanent solution.  Thank you for your audit, Johannes.
