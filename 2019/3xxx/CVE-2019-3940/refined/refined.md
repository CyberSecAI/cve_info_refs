  "CVE-2019-3940": {
    "root_cause": "Changes in the DsDaqWebService function in drawsrv.dll in Advantech WebAccess/SCADA version 8.3.3 introduced whitelisting of certain executables in WebAccess specific directories. However, webvrpcs.exe accepts unauthenticated RPC calls to perform remote file operations, including writing to disk, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious executable and save it as one of the whitelisted executables.",
