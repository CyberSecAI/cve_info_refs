    "root_cause": "The Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller contains an endpoint with improper authorization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authorization leading to privilege escalation."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote authenticated malicious user with read permissions can obtain a signed URL granting them write permissions to the bit-service. This allows a read-only user to potentially modify resources they should not have access to.",

      "Network access to the Cloud Controller endpoint."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user with read permissions to request package information."
