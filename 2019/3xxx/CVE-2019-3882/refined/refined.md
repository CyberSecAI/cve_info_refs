{
  "CVE-2019-3882": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "The vfio interface implementation did not limit the number of DMA mappings to device memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Violation of user's locked memory limit"
    ],
    "impact": "System memory exhaustion leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker with administrative ownership of a vfio device"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local attacker administratively granted ownership of the device bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci"
