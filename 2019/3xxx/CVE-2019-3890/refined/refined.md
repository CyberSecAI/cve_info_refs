CVE-2019-3890:
- Root cause: Evolution EWS can silently ignore all certificate errors if configured to ignore an initial error in gnome-online-accounts creation.
- Weakness: Improper validation of SSL certificates in evolution-ews.
- Impact: An attacker could obtain confidential information by tricking the user into connecting to a fake server without the user noticing the difference, as the connection is left open to being viewed and modified.
- Attack vector: Tricking a user to connect to a malicious server.
- Required attacker capabilities: The attacker needs to set up a fake server. The user needs to configure evolution-ews to ignore an initial error in gnome-online-accounts creation and then be tricked into connecting to the attacker's server.
