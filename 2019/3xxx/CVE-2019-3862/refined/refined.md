Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3862:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to a flaw in how `libssh2` parses `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST` packets with an exit status message when no payload is provided. Specifically, the code attempts to perform a memory comparison using `memcmp` without first checking if the packet length is at least as large as the size of the data being compared. This leads to reading beyond the bounds of the allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read caused by incorrect handling of packet lengths. The `memcmp` operation accesses memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   **Lack of proper input validation:** The code does not validate the packet length before attempting to access memory using it which leads to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service by causing a crash or abnormal termination of the affected client application.
*   **Information leak:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information stored in the memory of the client application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** This vulnerability is triggered by a malicious SSH server sending a crafted `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST` packet to a vulnerable client during the SSH handshake or data transfer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Compromised or Malicious SSH Server:** The attacker must control or have compromised an SSH server that a vulnerable client connects to.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to be able to deploy a malicious SSH server and be able to trick a user into connecting to it.
*   **Knowledge of SSH Protocol:** The attacker must be able to construct a specific type of `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST` packet.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `_libssh2_channel_request` function, more specifically when the message type is `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST` and the request type is `exit-status` and no payload is sent.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered during the SSH handshake or during regular data transfer.
*   The fix involves checking the packet length before accessing the packet memory.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in libssh2 version 1.8.1.
*   The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" by Red Hat and "Low" by SUSE.
*   CVSS v3 score of 9.1 on NVD and 3.5 on SUSE is attributed to this CVE.
