  "cveId": "CVE-2019-3930",
  "description": "The function **PARSERtoCHAR** in *libAwCgi.so* is called by the HTTP cgi scripts in multiple contexts. Sometimes without authentication (file\_transfer.cgi) and sometimes with authentication (return.cgi). CGI scripts that pass this function input that exceeds 0x100 bytes overflow a stack buffer. The following proof of concept shows a remote, unauthenticated attacker triggering this bug.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `PARSERtoCHAR` function within `libAwCgi.so`. This function is used by multiple CGI scripts, some of which do not require authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow in the `PARSERtoCHAR` function."
    ],
     "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "HTTP requests to vulnerable CGI scripts like `file_transfer.cgi`"
      ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request with input exceeding 0x100 bytes to the vulnerable CGI script's endpoint. No specific privileges or authentication are required."
