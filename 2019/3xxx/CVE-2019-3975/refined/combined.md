The following snippet shows the vulnerability:

.text:07007018      lea     eax, [ebp+b64Decoded]

.text:07007036      push    ecx
.text:07007037      push    edx                        ; attacked-controlled
.text:07007037                                         ; base64-encoded data
.text:07007038      call    base64_decode(uchar const *,int,uchar *,int *)
.text:0700703D      mov     ecx, [ebp+var_DecodedLen]
.text:07007040      lea     edx, [ebp+passwd_5C]       ; 0x5C bytes to function return address:
.text:07007040                                         ; stack overflow!!!
.text:07007043      lea     eax, [ebp+user_9C]
.text:07007049      push    edx
.text:0700704A      mov     [ebp+ecx+b64Decoded], 0
.text:07007052      lea     ecx, [ebp+b64Decoded]      ; attacker-controlled; up to 0x104 bytes
.text:07007058      push    eax
.text:07007059      push    ecx
.text:0700705A      call    GetUserPasswd(char *,char *,char *)

```

The GetUserPasswd function expects the Base64-decoded data to be in the form of 'USER:PASSWD' and copies the 'user' part to 'user' buffer on the stack and the 'passwd' part to the 'passwd' buffer on the stack. Because both the 'user' and the 'passwd' buffers can be smaller than the input data, a stack-based buffer overflow can occur.

The crash of webvrpcs.exe is shown in Windbg and the Windbg !exploitable extension shows the vulnerability is exploitable:
