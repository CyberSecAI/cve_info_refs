Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a local file disclosure flaw present in the page export function of Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when exporting a page to a Word document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Disclosure:** The core weakness is the ability to access and read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Unrestricted File Access:** The vulnerability allows reading files within the `<install-directory>/confluence/WEB-INF` directory and its subdirectories. This directory contains configuration files and sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in configuration files.
- **Credential Leakage:** The most critical impact is the potential leakage of credentials, especially LDAP credentials if specified within an `atlassian-user.xml` file or `crowd.properties` files.
- **Compromise of Integrations:** Leaked credentials could be used to compromise integrations with other services if credentials or other sensitive data was placed in that directory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Page Export Feature:** The attack is carried out via the page export functionality of Confluence.
- **Word Export:** The vulnerability is triggered when exporting to a Word document.
- **Add Page Permissions:** The attacker must have "Add Page" space permissions to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Confluence instance.
- **"Add Page" Space Permissions:** The attacker needs to have "Add Page" space permissions within Confluence.
- **No Authentication Bypass:** It doesn't appear to allow for authentication bypass, but requires a legitimate account with required permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory explicitly states that Atlassian Cloud instances are NOT affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "critical severity" by Atlassian.
- The provided content includes mitigation steps, specifically setting the `atlassian.confluence.export.word.max.embedded.images` system property to zero, to prevent images from being embedded in Word exports as a temporary workaround while upgrading.
- The vulnerability affects a range of Confluence Server and Data Center versions, specifically all versions starting with 6.1.0 before 6.6.16, from 6.7.0 before 6.13.7, and from 6.14.0 before 6.15.8.
- Fixes were released in Confluence Server and Data Center versions 6.6.16, 6.13.7 and 6.15.8.
