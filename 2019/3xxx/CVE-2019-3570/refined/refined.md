Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3570:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Heap corruption in the `scrypt_enc()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability arises from the possibility of an attacker controlling the scrypt parameters (N, r, and p). This could happen, for example, when an attacker provides an `scrypt_enc()` output, and the system attempts to verify it by calling `scrypt_enc()` with the same parameters. If these parameters are maliciously crafted, it can lead to heap corruption.
- The vulnerability resided in the custom implementation of scrypt algorithm within HHVM's `ext_scrypt`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Heap corruption, which can potentially lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the specific heap layout and the nature of the crafted parameters.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the parameters used in the `scrypt_enc()` function. This could be achieved through manipulation of the input provided to a system that then utilizes the `scrypt_enc()` for verification. 
- Specifically, an attacker could provide a crafted scrypt hash output generated with specific N, r, and p parameters, that would trigger the heap corruption upon verification.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control or influence the input provided to a system where HHVM's `scrypt_enc()` function is called. This could involve manipulating input data, or providing crafted stored hashes, to force the `scrypt_enc()` to process malicious parameters when verifying the hash.
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable code to be executed with their controlled parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented replaces the custom scrypt implementation with libsodium's implementation, which is more robust. The `scrypt_enc()` function now depends on libsodium and is marked as deprecated, with plans for removal in the future.
- The provided text also includes code examples of how to verify `scrypt_enc()` hashes using libsodium as a migration strategy.
