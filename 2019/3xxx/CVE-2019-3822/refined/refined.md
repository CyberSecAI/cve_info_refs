Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-3822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message` function within the `lib/vauth/ntlm.c` file of the curl library. This function is responsible for creating NTLM type-3 headers.
*   The incorrect implementation of a size check using unsigned math allows for a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a stack buffer overflow. Specifically, the code copies data from an NTLMv2 type-2 response header into a local buffer, and the size check is not sufficient to prevent a buffer overflow if the “nt response” data from the server is too large (around 1000 bytes or more).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, where a malicious server can cause a crash in the curl client due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution (Mitigated):** While the primary impact was a crash, the vulnerability could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution if the stack cookies were not present/working. However, stack protection mechanisms like StackGuard that are used in distributions such as Fedora mitigate this risk by triggering a crash if the stack cookie is overwritten.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attack vector is remote, where a malicious or compromised NTLM server provides a crafted NTLMv2 type-2 response with a large “nt response” data.
*   **NTLM Authentication:** This vulnerability is specifically related to NTLMv2 authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control or have compromised an NTLM server that curl connects to.
*   The attacker needs to be able to force the vulnerable curl client to use NTLMv2 authentication
*   The attacker must be capable of sending a malformed NTLMv2 type-2 response to the client that has an unusually large "nt response" value

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in libcurl versions 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0.
*   The fix involves proper handling and validation of sizes and lengths to prevent the overflow in  `Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message`.
*   Some distributions such as Fedora use stack protection mechanisms that mitigate arbitrary code execution but do not prevent DoS.
*   A Red Hat security advisory, RHSA-2019:3701, addresses this issue for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
*   The vulnerability is also referenced in NetApp's advisory NTAP-20190315-0001, noting that the vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data or a DoS.
*   Siemens security advisory SSA-436177 also mentions this vulnerability affecting their SINEMA Remote Connect client and server.
* The fix was introduced in the following commit: `https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/50c94842`.
