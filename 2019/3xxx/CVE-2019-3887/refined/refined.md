```
{
  "CVE-2019-3887": {
    "Root cause": "The KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict APIC MSR register values when nested virtualization is used.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of APIC MSR register values"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker in a guest VM could cause a denial of service (host OS crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker within a guest virtual machine could access the L0's APIC register values via L2 guest, when 'virtualize x2APIC mode' is enabled.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker requires access to a guest VM with nested virtualization enabled.  The attacker must be able to execute code within the guest operating system."
