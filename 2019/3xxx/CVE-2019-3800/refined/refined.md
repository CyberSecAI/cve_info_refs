Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-3800:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The CF CLI (Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface), prior to version v6.45.0, was writing the client ID and secret to its configuration file when a user authenticated using the `--client-credentials` flag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The client ID and secret, which are sensitive authentication credentials, were stored in the CF CLI's configuration file in plaintext. This file is typically stored on the user's local machine.
- **Credential Leakage:** By writing the client ID and secret to the config file, the credentials were exposed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A local, authenticated malicious user with access to the CF CLI config file could use the leaked client ID and secret to impersonate the legitimate client and gain unauthorized access to resources associated with the compromised client. This allows the attacker to act as the compromised client.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the machine where the CF CLI config file is stored. This implies that the attacker has already compromised the target system.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system with access to the CF CLI config file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the filesystem where the CF CLI configuration file is stored.
- **System User Account:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the system and be able to access the config file.
