- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied parameters in derived queries and manually defined queries within Spring Data JPA. Specifically, the predicates `startingWith`, `endingWith`, and `containing` in derived queries could return more results than anticipated when a maliciously crafted query parameter value is supplied. Additionally, LIKE expressions in manually defined queries could return unexpected results if the parameter values were not properly escaped.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **SQL Injection (or similar):** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input when constructing database queries. This allows attackers to manipulate the query logic through specially crafted parameter values.
    - **Information Exposure:** The consequence of the above is that more data than intended may be returned from the database, leading to potential information exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers could potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database that they should not have access to.
    - By manipulating the query, the attacker could potentially bypass access control mechanisms implemented by Spring Data JPA.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered via maliciously crafted query parameter values, supplied through the application's interface when using derived queries or manually defined queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to supply arbitrary values to query parameters that are used within `startingWith`, `endingWith`, `containing` predicates (derived queries) or LIKE expressions (manually defined queries) in Spring Data JPA.
