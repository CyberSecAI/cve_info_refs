Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Uncontrolled search path vulnerability in the installers of Dell Encryption Enterprise and Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The installers search for DLLs in an uncontrolled manner, making them susceptible to DLL hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A low-privileged local attacker can execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges by placing a malicious DLL in the installer's search path.
- This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a directory that is part of the installer's search path.
- The attack occurs during product installation, which is typically done by an administrator.
- User interaction is required in the form of an administrator executing the installer

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local, authenticated, low-privileged user
- Ability to write to the file system in a location that is part of the installer's DLL search path.
- The attack must occur before an administrator executes the installer.

**Affected Products:**
- Dell Encryption Enterprise prior to version 10.4.0
- Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise prior to version 2.4.0

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Dell Encryption version 10.4.0 or later
- Upgrade to Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise 2.4.0 or later
