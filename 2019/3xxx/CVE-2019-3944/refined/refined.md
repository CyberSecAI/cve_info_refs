Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-3944:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Parrot ANAFI drone is susceptible to Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the drone's handling of Wi-Fi deauthentication frames. It does not properly prevent a remote attacker from disconnecting the drone from its controller.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful attack causes the drone to lose connection with its controller, resulting in a denial of service. The drone's fallback behavior is to activate "Smart Return to Home" (RTH), which attempts to return the drone to its take-off point to prevent crashes, although the effectiveness of this mitigation was initially questioned.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is carried out remotely over Wi-Fi by sending deauthentication frames.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the drone and does not need any prior authentication.
