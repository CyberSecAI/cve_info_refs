    "description": "A vulnerability was found in qpid-dispatch-router. Any logged user can access QMF methods on Satellite's qpid broker which allows him to (un)install any available package on any system (managed by the Satellite) that runs katello agent / goferd.",
    "affected_components": [
      "qpid-dispatch-router"
    ],
    "root_cause": "A lack of access control in the message queues maintained by Satellite's QPID broker, used by katello-agent.",
