**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Dell Wyse Management Suite during device unregistration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application allows a malicious user to inject and store arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code when unregistering a device. This malicious code is then executed in the browsers of other users who access the stored data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable application in the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various impacts such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted request during the unregistering of a device, injecting malicious code
- The attack is triggered when another user accesses the data containing the malicious code through their web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges on the Dell Wyse Management Suite
- No specific user interaction is needed for the code to be stored, it gets triggered when other users access the data.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Dell Wyse Management Suite versions prior to 1.4.1.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
