Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3565:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way legacy C++ Facebook Thrift servers (using cpp instead of cpp2) handled messages with containers of fields of unknown types. Specifically, the server did not properly error when encountering these unknown types during the skip operation, allowing it to proceed instead of throwing an exception.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper input validation:** The server did not validate the types of fields within containers, leading to the possibility of processing invalid data.
- **Infinite loop:** The ability to skip unknown types, specifically `T_STOP`, in the parsing process, could cause thrift to enter an unbounded loop, due to the logic of how the protocol skips over data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious client could send specially crafted short messages with containers of invalid types that would take a disproportionately long time for the server to parse (due to the unbounded loop), potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious client:** An attacker needs to be able to send messages to a vulnerable Thrift server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send Thrift messages to a vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerability and be able to craft messages containing invalid types.

**Additional Information:**
- The commit `01686e15ec77ccb4d49a77d5bce3a01601e54d64` addresses this issue by adding a check for invalid skip types and throwing an exception, preventing the unbounded loop.
- The fix was included in Facebook Thrift v2019.05.06.00, indicating that versions prior to this are vulnerable.

The provided information contains the following details:
-  The specific commit that fixed the issue.
