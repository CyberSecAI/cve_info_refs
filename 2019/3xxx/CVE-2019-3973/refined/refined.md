{
  "CVE-2019-3973": {
    "Root cause": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the Cmdguard.sys driver due to improper bounds checking when handling messages sent to its filter port.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking",
       "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit leads to a kernel crash, causing a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
	  "Filter port message manipulation"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to crash the `CmdVirth.exe` process to decrease the connection count of the port, process hollow a copy of `CmdVirth.exe` with malicious code to obtain a port handle, and then send a specially crafted message via the `FilterSendMessage` API."
