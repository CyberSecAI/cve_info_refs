        "Command Injection",
        "Insufficient input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device.",
      "attack_vectors": "By hijacking DNS traffic from the sync module, attackers can redirect requests for updates to a malicious server, feeding malicious commands to the vulnerable `os.execute()` function.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and hijack DNS lookups."
