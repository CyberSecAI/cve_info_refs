Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3924:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The MikroTik RouterOS "The Dude" network discovery feature allows user-defined probes to be sent to discover network services. This feature supports "recursive scanning" where probes can be proxied through the Winbox port (8291). The vulnerability lies in the fact that authentication is not enforced on these proxied probe requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated intermediary/proxy:** The primary vulnerability is that an unauthenticated remote attacker can use a MikroTik router as a proxy to send arbitrary traffic. This circumvents the router's firewall, as the requests originate from the router itself.
- **Lack of authentication:** The Winbox port (8291) does not require authentication for proxied probe requests. This lack of authentication is the core issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Bypassing firewall rules:** Attackers can send traffic to internal network (LAN) hosts from the external network (WAN) that would normally be blocked by the firewall.
- **Network scanning:** Attackers can use the router to scan internal or external networks.
- **Arbitrary traffic proxying:** The router can be used as a proxy to send arbitrary traffic to other machines.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** The exploit example provided on Exploit-DB demonstrates how an attacker could use this vulnerability to upload a webshell to a LAN host and execute a reverse shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network access:** Attackers need network access to the MikroTik router's Winbox port (8291).
- **Malicious probe request:** Attackers craft a specific probe request that is sent to the router, which will proxy the attacker's request to the target machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to reach the router's Winbox port (8291). This can be from the WAN, if the port is exposed, or from a compromised machine within the network.
- The attacker does not need any credentials or prior access to the router.

**Additional notes:**
- The MikroTik probe functionality has limitations, such as only supporting up to three requests and responses and not relaying the full response back to the attacker, but rather matching against a regular expression.
- The vulnerability was fixed in RouterOS 6.42.12 (long-term) and 6.43.12 (stable).
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof of concept showing how the vulnerability could be used to exploit a device on the internal network by uploading a webshell and executing a reverse shell.
- Tenable assigned CVE-2019-3924 to this vulnerability.
- Tenable Research Advisory ID is TRA-2019-07.
- The vulnerability is classified as medium risk by Tenable.
