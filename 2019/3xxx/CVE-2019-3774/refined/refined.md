{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Spring Batch versions 3.0.9, 4.0.1, 4.1.0, and older unsupported versions were susceptible to XML External Entity Injection (XXE) when receiving XML data from untrusted sources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity Injection (XXE)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, cause denial of service, or potentially achieve remote code execution depending on the server's configuration.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted XML data to the vulnerable Spring Batch component."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send XML data to the application. They do not need any special privileges besides being able to reach the vulnerable endpoint."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Spring Batch versions 3.0.9, 4.0.1, 4.1.0 and older"
  ],
  "suggested_remediation": "Upgrade spring-batch jars to 3.0.10, 4.0.2, 4.1.1 or later. Spring Batch components that exhibited this vulnerability now disable the features as advised in the reference cheat sheet [1] by default, but allow user configuration of the components if the feature can be enabled because XML is received from a trusted source."
