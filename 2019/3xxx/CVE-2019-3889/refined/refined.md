Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-3889:

**Root Cause:**
- A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the authentication flow of the OpenShift Container Platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability.
- Improper handling of user input in the authentication flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could steal authentication data by tricking users into clicking a malicious link. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access to the OpenShift Container Platform.
- If an attacker can trick a user into loading the response in an iFrame or using content sniffing browser, it is possible to execute javascript even if the "Content-Type" header is set to "text/plain".

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious link containing malicious javascript which is then sent to a victim user.
- The victim user clicks the malicious link, which sends the request to the vulnerable application.
- The vulnerable application reflects the malicious javascript back to the user, which executes in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable application.
- The attacker gains access to authentication data.
- The attacker can also host the malicious link in an iFrame or use content sniffing browser to bypass the "text/plain" content type protection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute malicious links to potential victims.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into loading the malicious link.
- No specific privilege/access to the system is required for the attacker to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity by Red Hat.
- The fix for this issue is available in OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.1, 4.2 and 3.11.
- The HTTP Response "Content Type" is "text/plain", most browsers won't execute Javascript, but iFrames and content sniffing browsers can be used to exploit this issue.
- Correctly configuring "corsAllowedDomains" in OCP 3 can prevent attackers from getting a response from an attacker-hosted domain.
