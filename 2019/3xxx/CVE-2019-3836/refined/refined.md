Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3836:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly refers to CVE-2019-3836, specifically mentioning "Fixed an invalid pointer access via malformed TLS1.3 async messages" as the vulnerability associated with the CVE ID. The advisory also mentions that GnuTLS versions prior to 3.6.7 are vulnerable, which aligns with the official description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an invalid pointer access within the GnuTLS library.
- This occurs when processing malformed TLS 1.3 asynchronous messages, specifically post-handshake messages.
- The root cause is likely due to a lack of proper initialization of a handshake-related pointer within the `_gnutls13_recv_async_handshake` function, as suggested in the GitLab issue description.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Invalid Pointer Access:** The core vulnerability is an attempt to access memory through an invalid or uninitialized pointer, leading to unpredictable behavior.
- **Asynchronous Message Handling Flaw:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific malformed asynchronous messages exchanged during the TLS 1.3 handshake process.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. The program crashes due to the invalid pointer access and subsequent attempt to free the memory.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the malicious messages can be sent over a network connection.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Authentication Required:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send malformed TLS 1.3 asynchronous messages to a vulnerable GnuTLS server.
- The attacker does not need any prior capabilities beyond the ability to craft and send network packets.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The issue was introduced by a commit that added the ability to handle multiple split handshake messages: `_gnutls13_recv_async_handshake: process multiple and split handshake messages`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a specific test case: '1/4 fragmented keyupdate msg, appdata between'. This test case suggests the vulnerability might relate to how GnuTLS handles fragmented handshake messages with application data interspersed within the handshake.
*   The fix appears to involve an initialization of a local variable (hsk) in the `_gnutls13_recv_async_handshake` function, likely to prevent the uninitialized pointer access.
*   The vulnerability impacts GnuTLS versions 3.6.3 and later, prior to 3.6.7.
* The NetApp advisory specifically states that none of their products are affected due to their usage of the library or versions used, while the opensuse advisory lists the affected products that have been patched.
* RedHat states they fixed this in gnutls 3.6.7 and an attacker could use the flaw to crash an application compiled with gnutls via invalid pointer access.
* The SUSE information lists the affected SUSE products and the fixed version of the package, as well as the CVSS scores.

In summary, CVE-2019-3836 is a moderate to high-severity vulnerability where a network attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition in GnuTLS by sending specially crafted TLS 1.3 asynchronous messages, due to an invalid pointer access during handshake message processing.
