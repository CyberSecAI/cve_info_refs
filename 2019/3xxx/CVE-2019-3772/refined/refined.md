Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-3772

**Description:** The first document explicitly states "Spring Integration (spring-integration-xml and spring-integration-ws modules), versions 4.3.18, 5.0.10, 5.1.1, and older unsupported versions, were susceptible to XML External Entity Injection (XXE) when receiving XML data from untrusted sources."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of XML data received from untrusted sources.
- The spring-integration-xml and spring-integration-ws modules were not correctly configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- XML External Entity Injection (XXE): This allows an attacker to include malicious external entities within the XML data which can lead to various attacks including local file disclosure, remote file inclusion or denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious XML external entities.
- This may result in:
  - Disclosure of local files on the server.
  - Inclusion of remote files.
  - Denial-of-service attacks by causing the system to attempt to resolve external entities.
  - Potential for other server-side vulnerabilities if the parsed XML triggers unexpected actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending maliciously crafted XML data to vulnerable Spring Integration components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send XML data to an application utilizing the vulnerable Spring Integration versions.
- No user authentication seems to be necessary as the vulnerability is due to processing of incoming XML data.
- The attacker does not need to be local to the server if they can access the endpoint receiving the XML.

**Mitigation:**
- Users should upgrade the `spring-integration-ws` and `spring-integration-xml` modules to versions 4.3.19, 5.0.11, 5.1.2 or later, which address the XXE vulnerability by disabling vulnerable features by default.
- It is possible to re-enable the vulnerable feature in the upgraded versions if XML is received from a trusted source.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided document indicates that Spring Integration now disables features that can be exploited, by default, based on recommendations of the OWASP XXE Prevention Cheat Sheet.

The second document is a security advisory for Oracle products and contains no information regarding CVE-2019-3772. It does reference CVE-2019-3772 in the risk matrix of the "Oracle Retail Applications" section but does not provide any details beyond what is included in the first document, therefore this is **UNRELATED** to the technical details.
