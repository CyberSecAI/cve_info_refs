# Security Advisory for Networking Misconfiguration and Insufficient UART Protection Mechanisms

#### This article applies to:

[VMB5000](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/)
[VMB4540](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/)
[VMB4500](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/)
[VMB4000](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/)
[VMB3500](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/)
[VMB3000](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/)

Arlo is aware of two security vulnerabilities that affect some Arlo base stations. One is caused by a network misconfiguration, and the other is caused by insufficient UART protection mechanisms. These vulnerabilities were promptly resolved in a series of *automatic* firmware updates.

This was not a security breach, and no videos or personal information were accessed as a result of the vulnerabilities. As the cybersecurity landscape continually and rapidly evolves, Arlo remains committed and on the forefront of collaborating with security researchers like BugCrowd and Tenable to proactively identify opportunities to further enhance the security of Arlo’s platform.

## Networking Misconfiguration

Arlo base stations have two networking interfaces: one for the internal camera network and one for connection to an external LAN, such as a home network. If an attacker is connected to the same LAN as an Arlo base station, they can access the interface used for the internal camera network. This potentially allows the attacker to control a user’s Arlo camera.

**This vulnerability affects the following products:**

* VMB3010
* VMB4000
* VMB3500
* VMB4500
* VMB5000

**The following firmware updates were released by Arlo to resolve this vulnerability:**

* VMB3010 and VMB4000: 1.12.2.3\_2762
* VMB3500 and VMB4500: 1.12.2.4\_2773
* VMB5000: 1.12.2.2\_2824

**Note:** For all Arlo products, firmware updates are sent to your devices automatically. You do not need to manually update your firmware.

## Insufficient UART Protection Mechanisms

If someone has physical access to an Arlo base station, they can connect to the UART port using a serial connection. After making the connection, an attacker can gain access to sensitive information.

**This vulnerability affects the following products:**

* VMB3010
* VMB4000
* VMB3500
* VMB4500
* VMB5000

**The following firmware updates were released by Arlo to resolve this vulnerability:**

* VMB3010 and VMB4000: 1.12.2.3\_2772
* VMB3500 and VMB4500: 1.12.2.4\_2773
* VMB5000: 1.12.2.3\_59\_4a57cce

**Note:** For all Arlo products, firmware updates are sent to your devices automatically. You do not need to manually update your firmware.
