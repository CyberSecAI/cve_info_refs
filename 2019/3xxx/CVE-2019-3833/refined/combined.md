Additionally, updates for this package are received through the Red Hat Enterprise Linux repository.  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses only the openwsman-python client API bindings, not the server components of openwsman.  This issue affects the versions of openwsman as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1667070#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2019-01-17 11:22:40 UTC  ```  It was found that openwsman can access various secret files without having the correct privileges set. A local attacker could use this for information disclosure.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1667070#c7)  Adam Mariš    2019-02-11 13:47:47 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: NEC Corporation   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1667070#c9)  Adam Mariš    2019-02-25 13:08:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat OpenStack Platform currently only utilizes the client and python client API bindings, not the server components of openwsman. Additionally, updates for this package are received through the Red Hat Enterprise Linux repository.  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses only the openwsman-python client API bindings, not the server components of openwsman.  This issue affects the versions of openwsman as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Important, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1667070#c11)  Cedric Buissart    2019-03-12 10:30:23 UTC  ``` Created openwsman tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1687760](show_bug.cgi?id=1687760 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3816 openwsman: Arbitrary file disclosure due to root working directory [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1667070#c15)  Vitezslav Crhonek    2019-03-20 12:02:45 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1663718](show_bug.cgi?id=1663718) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1667070#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-03-26 05:36:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0638 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0638](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0638)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1667070#c19)  Andrej Nemec    2019-03-27 10:28:25 UTC  ``` References:  <http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1122623>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1667070#c20)  Fedora Update System    2019-03-29 02:58:22 UTC  ``` openwsman-2.6.5-9.fc29 has been pushed to the Fedora 29 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1674478#c0)  Adam Mariš    2019-02-11 13:02:34 UTC  ``` openwsman is vulnerable to infinite loop in process_connection() when parsing specially crafted HTTP requests.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1674478#c1)  Adam Mariš    2019-02-11 13:02:35 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Adam Mariš (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1674478#c2)  Adam Mariš    2019-02-11 13:02:37 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat OpenStack Platform currently only utilizes the client and python client API bindings, not the server components of openwsman. Additionally, updates for this package are received through the Red Hat Enterprise Linux repository.  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses only the openwsman-python client API bindings, not the server components of openwsman.  This issue affects the versions of openwsman as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1674478#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2019-03-12 10:32:58 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1122623>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1674478#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2019-03-12 10:33:40 UTC  ``` Created openwsman tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1687762](show_bug.cgi?id=1687762 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3833 openwsman: Infinite loop in process_connection() allows denial of service [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1674478#c11)  Fedora Update System    2019-03-29 02:58:25 UTC  ``` openwsman-2.6.5-9.fc29 has been pushed to the Fedora 29 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-01-21 11:15:08 UTC  ``` via report to security@suse.de  Hello Klaus,  openwsman upstream has been recently notified of a vulnerability in openwsman-server allowing arbitrary file disclosure via GET request. Our maintainer proposed a patch that allows only POST and NULL request methods, disallowing the rest of them. Could you please confirm?  First of all, we'd like to coordinate the disclosure date and ask about CVE assignment - will SUSE handle CVE assignment or can we (Red Hat) assign CVE?  Secondly, I believe the currently proposed patch won't work as it is possible to do the same even via POST method according to my tests on latest upstream version. Moreover, it is also possible to easily trigger a denial of service to openwsman-server. I haven't tracked down the root cause yet, but I have reproducers to share.

So "POST /etc/shadow ..." works just as well.  By the way, decide_what_to_do() function actually calls remove_double_dots(), however it is still possible to traverse one level above if one puts a dot at the beginning, like "POST ./etc/shadow ..." because root directory will be prepended to this path which is set to ".", hence resulting into double dots (separate CVE?)  Another problem is that POST is behaving like GET requests. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the purpose of this package and it's designed for such system management. Nevertheless, disclosing arbitrary file without authorization (which is used for PUT and DELETE requests) is still a problem.  Another problem is the denial of service caused by invalid request which results into infinite loop (process_connection() calls connection_desctructor() which calls process_connection() again, etc.). But this seems to be unrelated to this one, so probably it requires a separate CVE. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c7)  Adam Majer   2019-01-29 17:29:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adam Maris from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c6)) > Traversing the directory via double dots is actually not necessary, the > problem is that program calls chdir("/") in wsmand.c so there's no need for > traversing. So "POST /etc/shadow ..." works just as well.  When running in foreground mode as `openwsman -d`, this chdir() doesn't occur and all subsequent calls are relative to where `openwsman -d` was started from. So if testing in foreground,  cd / openwsman -d  > echo -e "GET /etc/shadow HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\rContent-Length: 6\r\nHello\r\n" | nc localhost 5985   The solution here would be to chdir to another subdirectory, but to me this is unclear as to *where* as there is no settings where it's suppose to change to. Maybe service_path() ? Then filter all paths that do not start with service_path() ? The attached patch does not filter the supplied paths, only does chroot, so it will fail in a real scenarios.   > By the way, decide_what_to_do() function actually calls > remove_double_dots(), however it is still possible to traverse one level > above if one puts a dot at the beginning, like "POST ./etc/shadow ..." > because root directory will be prepended to this path which is set to ".", > hence resulting into double dots (separate CVE?)  This is trivial fix for that function to just remove all dots, including leading dots. The constructs like /../......./ are already filtered. Only the first leading dots are not, and then another is prepended. But why prepend a dot considering it's in root directory?  I'm uncertain what is the purpose of this function as it strips out leading dots from dot files too, so I've renamed it.   > Another problem is that POST is behaving like GET requests.

But > this seems to be unrelated to this one, so probably it requires a separate > CVE.  Indeed, this resulted in a segfault from recursive call. This seems to be made on purpose. For example,  > echo -e "GET /etc/shadow HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\rContent-Length: 4444446\r\nContent-Type: t\n\nHello\r\n" | nc localhost 5985   I'm made a naive patch that addresses these issues. The connection is not closed, but it seems it's possible to avoid recursive calls and the connection is processed in due time. Looks like 1 second? Would that cause problems on workloads? In either case, it should not be doing this via recursion.  Alternative is to close the connection on error regardless. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c8)  Adam Majer   2019-01-29 17:30:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 795538](attachment.cgi?id=795538&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=795538&action=edit) patch ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c11)  Adam Majer   2019-02-05 13:30:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 796008](attachment.cgi?id=796008&action=diff "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=796008&action=edit "patch") patch  Attached is a proposed patch to address these problems.  1. I've renamed the remove_double_dots to remove_all_leading_dots, as that is what the function attempts to do but fails to account for the initial leading dots  2. in parse_http_request(), the remote io_inc_tail() is never called when part of the request is already parsed and c->loc is closed. Move this before the if() to avoid reparsing the same thing over and over.  3. I've removed infinite recursion bomb between connection_desctructor and process_connection. It's a little ugly where some casts are required, but return value is ignored anyway except to avoid this potential recursive bomb. Note that recursive bomb was triggered by #2 problem in the first place but it could happen independently with a crafted request.  4. I've added a check to verify that remote connection is not closed in the do_close flag... because if it's closed an assert in process_connection then fails or do_select() ends up with an error condition because of invalid socket (socket already closed)  5. I've changed the cwd, which is the base for all requests, to service_path instead of / . I've also moved this prior to checking for the foreground option so running openwsmand with -d param or without results in same cwd.  The `cwd` will probably result in some surprises... alternative is to filter all requests to only this path? Which is preferred? What is expected by users of openwsmand?  I'd welcome feedback on this and whether this fixes problems addressed in [Comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c6) *without* causing some side effects for users. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c12)  Adam Maris   2019-02-11 13:26:14 UTC  ``` >  > I'd welcome feedback on this and whether this fixes problems addressed in > [Comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c6) *without* causing some side effects for users.  Thanks for the patch, it looks good to me regarding fixing these issues. I can't comment much on side effects. However, the default value for service_path is /wsman if not specified otherwise and if it doesn't exist (it's not created by default) then it asserts. Should the creation of this directory be rather addressed in distro specific code (e.g. spec file)?  I think it would be reasonable to decouple this into two CVEs, one for the disclosure addressed by 1 and 5, and another one for the rest, causing DoS. I can get the second CVE. Would that work for you? ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c13)  Marcus Meissner   2019-02-18 13:30:50 UTC  ``` Redhat assigned:  CVE-2019-3833 openwsman: Infinite loop in process_connection() allows denial of service ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c15)  Marcus Meissner   2019-02-21 15:15:34 UTC  ``` CRD: 2019-03-04 ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1122623#c16)  Adam Majer   2019-03-04 15:57:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 798778](attachment.cgi?id=798778&action=diff "filter path relative to service directory") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=798778&action=edit "filter path relative to service directory") filter path relative to service directory  I've added another patch to make sure that all paths are filtered based on the service path (default: /wsman).

The service path approach, while a good one, doesn't work for all cases. wsman standard describes /wsman (authorized) and /wsman-anon (non-authorized) as allowed cases.
