    "description": "It was discovered that mod_auth_mellon incorrectly handled certain requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to access sensitive information.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect handling of certain requests in mod_auth_mellon when used as a reverse proxy with ECP flow",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Authentication Bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive information.",
      "attack_vector": "Exploitation is possible by sending specifically crafted HTTP headers when mod_auth_mellon is configured as a reverse proxy with ECP flow, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to access protected resources.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send specially crafted HTTP requests that include headers normally used in the SAML ECP (Enhanced Client or Proxy) flow to a server utilizing mod_auth_mellon as a reverse proxy. This implies the attacker has some network access to the vulnerable system and possibly a good understanding of the ECP protocol."

           },
      "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is exploitable in environments where Apache is configured as a reverse proxy and mod_auth_mellon is set to require authentication (require valid-user). By sending specific HTTP headers related to SAML ECP flow, an attacker can bypass the authentication, gaining unauthorized access to the proxied resources. The vulnerability does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 due to the lack of ECP support in that version."
