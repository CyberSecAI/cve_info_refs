{
  "CVE-2019-3880": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way Samba implemented an RPC endpoint emulating the Windows registry service API. An unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to create a new registry hive file anywhere they have unix permissions which could lead to creation of a new file in the Samba share.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a path/symlink traversal issue in the winreg_SaveKey RPC endpoint, allowing unprivileged users to write registry files outside of their designated share.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal",
      "Improper access control",
       "Unprivileged file creation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can create new files in a Samba share or, if symlinks are allowed, outside of the share, where they have unix permissions to write new files.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
      "RPC endpoint"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An unprivileged, authenticated user with write permissions to a Samba share and ability to create symlinks if writing outside a share is intended. This could also affect Linux <> Linux configurations."
