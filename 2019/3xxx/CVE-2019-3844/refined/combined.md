# USN-4269-1: systemd vulnerabilities

5 February 2020

Several security issues were fixed in systemd.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [systemd](/security/cves?package=systemd) - system and service manager

## Details

It was discovered that systemd incorrectly handled certain PIDFile files.

A local attacker could possibly use this issue to trick systemd into

killing privileged processes. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2018-16888](/security/CVE-2018-16888))

It was discovered that systemd incorrectly handled certain udevadm trigger

commands. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause systemd

to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-20386](/security/CVE-2019-20386))

Jann Horn discovered that systemd incorrectly handled services that use the

DynamicUser property. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

access resources owned by a different service in the future. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2019-3843](/security/CVE-2019-3843), [CVE-2019-3844](/security/CVE-2019-3844))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that systemd incorrectly handled certain Polkit

queries. A local attacker could use this issue to cause systemd to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code and

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-1712](/security/CVE-2020-1712))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 19.10

* [systemd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd)
  -
  [242-7ubuntu3.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd/242-7ubuntu3.6)

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [systemd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd)
  -
  [237-3ubuntu10.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd/237-3ubuntu10.38)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [systemd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd)
  -
  [229-4ubuntu21.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd/229-4ubuntu21.27)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.
