```
{
  "CVE-2019-3972": {
    "Root cause": "CmdAgent.exe reads from a section object that is writable by the 'Everyone' group. This object contains a SharedMemoryDictionary structure. By modifying the data in this structure, an attacker can cause CmdAgent.exe to perform an out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unprotected shared memory object",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (crash of CmdAgent.exe)",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system with the ability to write to the shared memory object.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Low privileged local process is sufficient."
  }
