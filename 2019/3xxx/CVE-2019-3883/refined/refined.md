{
  "CVE-2019-3883": {
    "description": "In 389-ds-base, requests are handled by worker threads. Each socket will be waited by the worker for at most 'ioblocktimeout' seconds. However this timeout applies only for un-encrypted requests. Connections using SSL/TLS are not taking this timeout into account during reads, and may hang longer. An unauthenticated attacker could repeatedly create hanging LDAP requests to hang all the workers, resulting in a Denial of Service.",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `ioblocktimeout` setting is not enforced on SSL/TLS connections, leading to potential hangs.",
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial-of-service by creating hanging LDAP requests, effectively blocking all worker threads.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, targeting the LDAP port.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication and only requires network access to the LDAP service."
