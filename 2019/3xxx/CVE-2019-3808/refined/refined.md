Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-3808

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 'manage groups' capability in Moodle lacked the 'XSS risk' flag, despite having access that could be exploited via XSS in certain parts of the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing 'XSS risk' flag on the 'manage groups' capability
- Potential for stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the missing flag.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the system, which would be executed when a user with the 'manage groups' capability accesses the affected areas. This could lead to:
- Account compromise of users with the 'manage groups' capability.
- Data theft or manipulation.
- Unauthorized actions within the Moodle platform.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker would need to be able to modify group settings or content within the Moodle platform. This would likely be achieved through existing administrator or teacher-level access.
- The injected malicious script would be stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a role with the 'manage groups' capability (typically teacher or manager roles). This is described as being a "trusted user".
- The attacker must have the ability to modify user group details/settings in Moodle.
- The attacker needs to craft and inject a malicious script within the context of the 'manage groups' capability.

**Affected versions:**
Moodle versions 3.6 to 3.6.1, 3.5 to 3.5.3, 3.4 to 3.4.6, 3.1 to 3.1.15 and earlier unsupported versions.

**Patched versions:**
Moodle versions 3.6.2, 3.5.4, 3.4.7 and 3.1.16

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Fariskhi Vidyan.
- The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description. It mentions that the capability is intended for use by trusted users (teachers and managers by default) which somewhat mitigates impact.
