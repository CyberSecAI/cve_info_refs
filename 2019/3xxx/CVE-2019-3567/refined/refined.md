- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject a new executable path into the `extensions.load` file for osquery. Additionally, an attacker can create a hard link from a parent folder containing a malicious binary to a folder with known "safe" permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unrestricted write access allows the modification of the `extensions.load` file.
    - Lack of proper validation and permissions checks when loading extensions.
    - Ability to create hard links to bypass directory restrictions
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute a malicious binary with SYSTEM permissions, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Modifying the `extensions.load` file
    - Creation of hard links to manipulate file system locations and permissions
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to modify the `extensions.load` file and create hard links. This implies the attacker has some level of access to the system, although the exact level is not specified (could be local user with some elevated privileges).
    - The attacker needs to be able to place the malicious binary on the target system.
