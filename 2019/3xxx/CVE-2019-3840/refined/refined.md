  "CVE-2019-3840": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was discovered in libvirt before version 5.0.0 in the way it gets interface information through the QEMU agent. An attacker in a guest VM can use this flaw to crash libvirtd and cause a denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the `virJSONValueObjectHasKey` function within `util/virjson.c`. This occurs when the libvirt daemon attempts to retrieve interface information from a guest VM via the QEMU agent. Specifically, if the QEMU agent fails to respond to a \"guest-network-get-interfaces\" command, the reply variable can be NULL. Subsequently, when `virJSONValueObjectGet()` is called on this NULL reply, it triggers the dereference.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Improper handling of missing QEMU agent responses"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker within a guest VM can exploit this vulnerability to crash the `libvirtd` service on the host, leading to a denial of service affecting other VMs. The attacker can cause the qemu-ga to fail to reply to the “guest-network-get-interfaces” command.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Guest VM to host attack via QEMU agent"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires an account within the guest VM and the ability to manipulate the qemu guest agent to not respond or to send invalid responses to the host system. It is also noted that the flaw can be triggered if the qemu agent does not reply to the “guest-network-get-interfaces” command."
