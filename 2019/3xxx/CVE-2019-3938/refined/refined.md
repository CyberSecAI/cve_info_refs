  "cve_id": "CVE-2019-3938",
  "description": "Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2 stores usernames, passwords, and other configuration options in the file generated via the \"export configuration\" feature. The configuration file is encrypted using the awenc binary. The same binary can be used to decrypt any configuration file since all the encryption logic is hard coded. A local attacker can use this vulnerability to gain access to devices username and passwords.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The configuration file is encrypted using the awenc binary. The same binary can be used to decrypt any configuration file since all the encryption logic is hard coded.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded encryption logic",
      "Credentials stored in exported configuration files"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can gain access to device usernames and passwords.",
    "attack_vector": "A local attacker can access the exported configuration file, use the awenc tool to decrypt it and obtain credentials.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the device or exported configuration file"
