- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Plain-text storage of TACACS/Radius credentials in the system settings menu.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Credentials for TACACS/Radius authentication are stored in plain text instead of being encrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has authenticated access to the system settings menu can obtain the exposed credentials, which can then be used for further malicious activities. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the network and other systems, along with the potential for data breaches and other impacts.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via the system settings menu of the affected devices. An attacker requires authenticated access to this menu to view the credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have already gained authenticated access to the system settings menu of the affected Dell EMC PowerConnect devices.
