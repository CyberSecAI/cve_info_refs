## Description

![@itsacoderepo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5180740?u=7ac7f210b1a5a3216ffd4e5ef8139aa675cfcee6&v=4&size=48)[itsacoderepo](https://github.com/itsacoderepo)opened [on Jan 2, 2019](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/1927#issue-395324645)

**Describe the bug**

The import of a project is prone to a path traversal and thus an arbitrary file write.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Download [payload.txt](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/files/2721399/payload.txt)
2. `gzip payload.txt`, `payload.txt.gz` is greated
3. Go to OpenRefine, `Import Projects`
4. Choose `payload.txt.gz`
5. Import file
6. `cat /tmp/ohno` should show the content of the file.

**Current Results**

The first 100 bytes are from the file `payload.txt` are chosen as path, *not* the filename itself. An error is also shown but is not related to the path traversal.

**Expected behavior**

Show an error, warn user, do not write file outside of the project folder.

**OpenRefine (please complete the following information):**

* Demo with 3.1 but should work with master

**Datasets**

Payload file

<https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/files/2721399/payload.txt>

**Additional context**

Please also update dependencies. The ant library is out of date and sloppy (compared to other) handling (tar) archive header.
