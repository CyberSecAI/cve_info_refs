Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-3955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the server-side application (Dameware Remote Mini Control) failing to properly validate the `RsaPubKeyLen` field during the key negotiation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The lack of proper validation on `RsaPubKeyLen` allows an attacker to specify an excessively large value. This leads to a heap buffer overflow when the server attempts to copy the client-provided RSA public key using `memcpy` into a fixed-size heap buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the application (DWRCS.exe), resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring any authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to send a crafted message with a large `RsaPubKeyLen` value to the Dameware Remote Mini Control server during the key negotiation process.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Dameware Remote Mini Control version 12.1.0.34 and prior.
*   **Vulnerability Details:** The vulnerability occurs in the `PBE_InitKey` function of the `DWRCRSS.dll`. The provided crash dump highlights this function.
*   **Key Exchange:** The vulnerability is triggered during the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange as part of the initial communication between client and server.
*   **Message Structure:** The exploit leverages the `MSG_000105b9` structure, which includes multiple length-specified fields vulnerable to this type of attack.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 (High) and a CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 (Medium)
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor has released a hotfix to address this issue: [https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Dameware-Mini-Remote-Control-12-1-0-Hotfix-2-Release-Notes](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Dameware-Mini-Remote-Control-12-1-0-Hotfix-2-Release-Notes)
