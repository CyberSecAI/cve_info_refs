#### Description

RouterOS versions 6.45.6 Stable, 6.44.5 Long-term, and below allow remote unauthenticated attackers to trigger DNS queries via port 8291. The queries are sent from the router to a server of the attacker's choice. The DNS responses are cached by the router, potentially resulting in cache poisoning

### Synopsis

#### CVE-2019-3976: Relative Path Traversal in NPK Parsing

RouterOS 6.45.6 Stable, RouterOS 6.44.5 Long-term, and below are vulnerable to an arbitrary directory creation vulnerability via the upgrade package's name field. If an authenticated user installs a malicious package then a directory could be created and the developer shell could be enabled.

See [option\_npk](https://github.com/tenable/routeros/tree/master/option_npk/) in our research GitHub for a proof of concept.

#### CVE-2019-3977: Insufficient Validation of Upgrade Package's Origin

RouterOS 6.45.6 Stable, RouterOS 6.44.5 Long-term, and below insufficiently validate where upgrade packages are download from when using the autoupgrade feature. Therefore, a remote attacker can trick the router into "upgrading" to an older version of RouterOS and possibly resetting all the system's usernames and passwords.

#### CVE-2019-3978: Insufficient Protections of a Critical Resource (DNS Requests/Cache)

RouterOS versions 6.45.6 Stable, 6.44.5 Long-term, and below allow remote unauthenticated attackers to trigger DNS queries via port 8291. The queries are sent from the router to a server of the attacker's choice. The DNS responses are cached by the router, potentially resulting in cache poisoning.

See [winbox\_dns\_request](https://github.com/tenable/routeros/tree/master/poc/winbox_dns_request) in our research GitHub for a proof of concept.

#### CVE-2019-3979: Improper DNS Response Handling

RouterOS versions 6.45.6 Stable, 6.44.5 Long-term, and below are vulnerable to a DNS unrelated data attack. The router adds all A records to its DNS cache even when the records are unrelated to the domain that was queried. Therefore, a remote attacker controlled DNS server can poison the router's DNS cache via malicious responses with additional and untrue records.

#### Combined

By chaining these vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated remote attacker with access to port 8291 on the router, can perform a RouterOS downgrade, reset the system passwords, and potentially gain a root shell.

### Solution

Upgrade to version 6.45.7 Stable or 6.44.6 Long-term or newer.

Additionally, disable the Winbox interface. If you must use it, restrict access to specific IP addresses and never open the port to the internet. Finally, while not related to this disclosure, always disable the default admin user.

#### Description

RouterOS versions 6.45.6 Stable, 6.44.5 Long-term, and below are vulnerable to a DNS unrelated data attack. The router adds all A records to its DNS cache even when the records are unrelated to the domain that was queried. Therefore, a remote attacker controlled DNS server can poison the router's DNS cache via malicious responses with additional and untrue records.
