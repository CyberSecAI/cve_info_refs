{
  "CVE-2019-3978": {
    "Root cause": "Insufficient protections of DNS requests and caching mechanisms.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The router allows remote unauthenticated attackers to trigger DNS queries via port 8291.",
      "The router caches DNS responses, potentially leading to cache poisoning."
    ],
    "Impact": "DNS cache poisoning, potentially allowing attackers to redirect traffic to malicious servers.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote unauthenticated attacker.",
      "Exploitation of port 8291."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to port 8291 on the target router."
  }
}
