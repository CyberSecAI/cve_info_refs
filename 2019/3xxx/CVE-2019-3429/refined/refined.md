- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A file reading vulnerability exists in ZTE ZXCLOUD GoldenData VAP product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthorized file reading leading to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can obtain log file information, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network based (AV:N) and requires low attacker capabilities, although it's considered high difficulty (AC:H). The attacker does not need privileges (PR:N), or user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and needs to exploit the file reading vulnerability, although the attack requires high effort.
