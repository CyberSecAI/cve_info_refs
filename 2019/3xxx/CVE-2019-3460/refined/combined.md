Debian Bug     : 927781

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-5995

    ADLab of VenusTech discovered that the kernel logged the virtual
    addresses assigned to per-CPU data, which could make it easier to
    exploit other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130, CVE-2019-11091

    Multiple researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the way
    that Intel processor designs implement speculative forwarding of
    data filled into temporary microarchitectural structures
    (buffers).  This flaw could allow an attacker controlling an
    unprivileged process to read sensitive information, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the system, or
    across guest/host boundaries to read host memory.

    See <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html>
    for more details.

    To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to
    install updated CPU microcode.  An updated intel-microcode package
    (only available in Debian non-free) was provided via DLA-1789-1.
    The updated CPU microcode may also be available as part of a
    system firmware ("BIOS") update.

CVE-2019-2024

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the em28xx video capture
    driver.  Local users might be able to use this for denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460

    Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Karamba Security Ltd. research
    team discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP
    implementation.  If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker
    could use these to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3882

    It was found that the vfio implementation did not limit the number
    of DMA mappings to device memory.  A local user granted ownership
    of a vfio device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (out-of-memory condition).

CVE-2019-3901

    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition that would allow a
    local user to read performance events from a task after it
    executes a setuid program.  This could leak sensitive information
    processed by setuid programs.  Debian's kernel configuration does
    not allow unprivileged users to access peformance events by
    default, which fully mitigates this issue.

CVE-2019-6133

    Jann Horn of Google found that Policykit's authentication check
    could be bypassed by a local user creating a process with the same
    start time and process ID as an older authenticated process.
    PolicyKit was already updated to fix this in DLA-1644-1.  The
    kernel has additionally been updated to avoid a delay between
    assigning start time and process ID, which should make the attack
    impractical.

CVE-2019-9503

    Hugues Anguelkov and others at Quarkslab discovered that the
    brcmfmac (Broadcom wifi FullMAC) driver did not correctly
    distinguish messages sent by the wifi firmware from other packets.
    An attacker using the same wifi network could use this for denial
    of service or to exploit other vulnerabilities in the driver.

CVE-2019-11190

    Robert Święcki reported that when a setuid program was executed it
    was still possible to read performance events while the kernel set
    up the program's address space.  A local user could use this to
    defeat ASLR in a setuid program, making it easier to exploit other
    vulnerabilities in the program.  Debian's kernel configuration
    does not allow unprivileged users to access peformance events by
    default, which fully mitigates this issue.

CVE-2019-11486

    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the
    Siemens R3964 line discipline.  A local user could use these to
    cause unspecified security impact.  This module has therefore been
    disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
    implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
    escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-1.  This version also includes a fix for Debian bug #927781,
and other fixes included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

    denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
    escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-1.  This version also includes a fix for Debian bug #927781,
and other fixes included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux and linux-latest
packages.  You will need to use "apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs"
or "apt upgrade" as the binary package names have changed.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1663179#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2019-01-03 11:28:24 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of Logical link control and adaptation protocol (L2CAP), part of the bluetooth stack in the  l2cap_parse_conf_rsp, l2cap_parse_conf_req functions.  An attacker with physical access within the range of standard bluetooth transmission can create a specially crafted packet.

Subject: Re: linux-distros membership application - Microsoft

Hi Sasha,

Thank you for posting this application.

Are you also on security@...?  If so, then on one hand also being on
linux-distros would probably be of less use to you since I suspect most
of the issues relevant to Microsoft are in the Linux kernel, but on the
other hand you could serve as a liaison to that group.

This does sound like it includes a Linux distro, but obviously there's
no security track record for it yet, so it's hard to estimate relevance
of information you'd obtain via linux-distros to that product.

You call this "a Linux based distro", but that's not clear to me from
the web page you reference, which talks about managing (third-party?)
distros in the WSL2 subsystem.  Can you clarify this, please?

These look like SaaS offerings.  We do not have any explicit guidelines
on whether "provide public access to a Linux based distribution" is
potentially enough to qualify for linux-distros or not.  We do have
Amazon as a member, so there's that precedent.

It'd be helpful if you could directly address this part: "including some
that had been handled on (linux-)distros, meaning that membership would
have been relevant to you".  Without such examples yet, we'd have to be
guessing whether the membership would have been relevant to you or not.

Right now, the statistics at:

<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros/stats>

only go until the end of 2018, so you'd be able to use them for examples
dating back to 2018 and earlier.  We should ask Gentoo to update these
statistics soon, perhaps for period until end of June 2019, which will
be possible soon.

If Microsoft volunteers for these, I'd like that to be in "primary" role
at least for the technical task of "3. Review and/or test the proposed
patches ..."  I think Amazon hasn't been doing enough on that front,
especially given the request to "inform the list of the work done even
if no issues were encountered".  Given this request, if this were
seriously worked on, I would have expected such reports from Amazon on
almost every issue handled on linux-distros, but this wasn't the case.

I also would like a distro (maybe Microsoft) to volunteer for Technical:

4. Check if related issues exist in the same piece of software (e.g.,
same bug class common across the software, or other kinds of bugs exist
in its problematic component), and inform the list either way

and Administrative:

4. Evaluate relevance to other parties such as the upstream, other
affected distros (not present on the (sub-)list), and other Open Source
projects, see if the report mentions notifying any of these, communicate
your findings and possible concerns to the reporter and the list, and
stay on top of the resulting discussion until a decision is made on who
else to possibly notify (or not) and any such notifications are in fact
made (with the reporter's approval)

These are completely unclaimed now, but are much needed.

For Technical "4. Check if related issues exist ...", we sometimes get
some helpful for varying distros' package maintainers and such, but this
is not consistent.  For example, recently Takashi Iwai of SUSE helped
with Linux Marvell Wi-Fi driver issues - thanks! - but this is more of
an exception than the rule.

The lack of a volunteer distro for Administrative "4. Evaluate relevance
to other parties ..." came up e.g. here:

"Linux kernel: Bluetooth: two remote infoleaks (CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460)"

Great.

Let's discuss this further, and perhaps arrive at a decision in July.

Subject: Linux kernel: Bluetooth: two remote infoleaks (CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460)

Hi,

Ran Menscher (Bcc'ed on this message) reported two issues (crediting
"Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and Karamba Security Ltd. research team")
in Linux's Bluetooth stack to linux-distros and security@k.o on
January 1.  Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly to me, we collectively
failed to handle these issues well.  We did some things right, but not
all of those that ideally would have been done before embargo end.  From
the start, Ran was unwilling to precisely follow the linux-distros list
policy (set a tentative public disclosure date/time) and to stay on top
of the issues, instead expecting linux-distros to act more like a CERT
(coordinate with other parties), which it mostly is not.  I did point
this out to Ran, and suggested contacting Android, but I think no one
did that.  (See the third "forwarded message" below on this "not a CERT"
aspect and what can be done about it.)  The Bluetooth subsystem
maintainers didn't reply.  Distros appeared uninterested in doing
anything about the issues under embargo.  There were also numerous
occasions where I ended up substituting for other distros' roles they
had volunteered for.  And now I am doing Ran's job of making the
mandatory posting to oss-security (after a reminder yesterday).

On the bright side, I appreciate Greg KH's (security@k.o) handling of
these issues.  Greg took care of notifying the Bluetooth maintainers and
produced patches suitable for posting to the Linux lists (but still
needing review and testing), and made such postings as soon as the
embargo was over.  The thread with patches:

[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047@kroah.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047%40kroah.com/)

I also appreciate Yves-Alexis Perez (Debian) assigning the CVE IDs:

Also very helpful was Ran's answer that "According to git blame, the
issues had been introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in 2005)", and in the
first place the discovery of issues and the notification - thank you,
Ran and the Karamba Security research team!

Finally, I think it's good that we're pushing this out without further
delay (which no one requested).  Hopefully, we'll see greater progress
at handling of these issues now that the embargo is over.

I am sorry for the bitterness of my messages (including this one), which
I write from my list admin perspective.  I certainly understand that it
feels differently from a researcher perspective - for some, it'd be nice
to have a send-and-forget list, where the rest of the community would
take care of everything else.  It's just that such a list doesn't
currently exist.  There was oCERT for ~10 years, which provided this
service, but there was surprisingly little demand (vendor-sec and then
(linux-)distros saw much more use) and embargo times were much longer.

CC: Guy Sagy <guy.sagy at karambasecurity.com>
Date: Tue, 1 Jan 2019 09:27:59 +0000

The Linux Kernel's Blutooth stack suffers from two remote information leak vulnerabilities in the code

that handles incoming L2cap configuration packets.
These were both discovered by Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and  Karamba Security Ltd. research team.
We wish to coordinate a disclosure with all relevant parties.

BUG 1 ? HEAP ADDRESS INFOLEAK IN USE OF L2CAP_GET_CONF_OPT

VULNERABILITY
In the function l2cap_get_conf_opt (l2cap_core.c), which is used to parse configuration elements during
an L2cap connection negotiation process.
In this function, there is a ?dual use? for the output parameter ?val?. If the length of the data is 1,2 or 4, then
the returned value Is a value copied from an input buffer (received over BT) and returned ?by value?. If the
length is different, the value is returned as a pointer to the buffer ?by reference?. The buffer is from a kernel
SKB. Since the length is taken from the same buffer and the buffer is received via BT, the attacker controls
whether the val is returned as a pointer or as a value.
The val is later used as a value or as a pointer depending on a different field called ?type?, which is attacker
controlled and taken from the same buffer. The ?val? output parameter is assumed to match the ?type? and is
either used by reference or by value accordingly. This assumption is where the bug is. An attacker can send a
response where - for example ? the type is MTU (which uses 2 bytes from ?val? by-value), and the length is 3,
and so the returned MTU will actually be comprised of the 2 lower bytes of the pointer to the buffer, which
will be leaked to the attacker. It is a form of type confusion without having a sophisticated type system.

EXPLOIT
This flaw can be reached via multiple paths so there may be many ways to exploit it. One such example is using
a response with a ?rejected? result like in the known exploit for CVE-2017-1000251 for Amazon Echo, with an mtu config option sized 0
bytes. The returned mtu will then, usually, be the lower bytes of the pointer to the buffer.

EXPLOIT EFFECT
Leak bytes of heap address to attacker. Currently we only know and tested that it is possible a leak of the 2
lower bytes or a few bits of other data. bug still exists in latest kernel.

BUG 2 ? HEAP DATA INFOLEAK IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS INCLUDING FUNCTION L2CAP_PARSE_CONF_RSP
VULNERABILITY
In the functions l2cap_parse_conf_rsp, l2cap_parse_conf_req (l2cap_core.c), and other locations, there is a while loop
which is used to parse configuration elements during an L2cap connection negotiation process.
In this function, the processing of data is performed in the while loop before the check if all the data processed
is inside the buffer. In addition, if data outside of the buffer is processed, the function will not return an error.
Therefore, data that is out of bands can be processed, and in some cases returned to the attacker.
EXPLOIT
This flaw can be reached via multiple paths so there may be many ways to exploit it. One such example is using
a response with a ?pending? status as with with the known exploit for CVE-2017-1000251 for Samsung Gear S3 exploit,
and make sure the request is aligned to the SKB buffer size and contains a configuration option at the end of the buffer which is of type ?EFS? and
length 0x10 (followed by 2 0x00 bytes). This efs element is then returned to the attacker and contains 0xE
bytes of out-of-bounds heap data. It is important to keep the total returned data size smaller then the return
buff size.
EXPLOIT EFFECT
Leak several bytes of heap data to attacker. Currently we only know that it is possible process 1 configuration
option per request, the length of which is at most the size of the largest configuration element. We have
internally tested a leak using an efs configuration option, leaking approx. 12 bytes. bug still exists in latest kernel.

Thank you Alexander.

The main priority is to coordinate a responsible fix prior to any disclosure.

This conflicts with the ultimatum system suggested which is more relevant to non-responsive vendors.

For this reason the previous mail had no such demands, and will for now accept any internal deadline you will decide on.

The same concern is with the bluetooth list, I hoped to reach the relevant parties via this secure list.

please aid in reaching any party relevant to fixing the issue, as long as responsible disclosure is maintained.

regarding the specific questions:

  1.  According to git blame, the issues had been introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in 2005)
  2.  This issue is different than the reference brought in that it's remotely triggered.
  3.  We would appreciate your help with assigning a CVE ID.
  4.  proper diffs: as per my understanding, the difference should be merely the reference directory for git,

       I would unfortunately request that you make use of the given patch, as it will take me far too long to make further adjustments.

as I see the next steps:

  1.  I await your fix until a deadline of your suggestion
  2.  I only intervene again if no deadline has been decided on until January 14.
  3.  I would request that a proper notification will be sent when I'm both allowed and required to inform oss-security

Thanks,

Hi,

Per published linux-distros list policy, you were/are supposed to
specify a tentative public disclosure date/time (within 14 days max, so
January 14 at the latest and preferably sooner) in your very first
message.  Please do that ASAP.

Are these issues relevant to distros - in other words, when were they
introduced, what's the earliest affected version of the kernel?

Here's an example of Bluetooth issues reported a couple of months ago
and apparently being of no interest to distros:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/10/31/6>

Your report looks better (it even includes patches), yet this lack of
interest in distros doing anything on kernel Bluetooth issues might
apply here as well.

Have you already requested CVE IDs for these?  If not, would you like
linux-distros to assign CVE IDs?

And then there's Greg's request for proper diffs and question about
notifying the Bluetooth maintainers.  We'd like to have that answer,
too.  Please note that the linux-bluetooth mailing list is public, so
only send to there if/once you intend to make the issues public.

Last but not least, please note that as soon as the issues are made
public, per linux-distros list policy you must post about them to the
public oss-security list.  Perhaps do this at the same time with making
your postings to linux-bluetooth, linux-kernel, and netdev lists, but
separately from the posting to those lists (don't use CC, but refer to
the other posting - please see my example linked above).

Thanks,

In my experience, this system is relevant regardless of which side the
delay would have been on.

OK, if you don't, then I set these dates/times:

January 9, 15:00 UTC - tentative public disclosure date/time (may be
postponed if a good reason is given, but will be in effect otherwise).

January 14, 15:00 UTC - the latest allowed public disclosure date/time.

> The same concern is with the bluetooth list, I hoped to reach the relevant parties via this secure list.

You did reach some Linux distros and upstream Linux kernel security
team.  To also reach Bluetooth developers, please e-mail:

BLUETOOTH SUBSYSTEM
M:      Marcel Holtmann <marcel@...tmann.org>
M:      Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@...il.com>

or reply to Greg's offer to contact them for you (which I think is what
he meant).

> please aid in reaching any party relevant to fixing the issue, as long as responsible disclosure is maintained.

My guess is you'll want to notify the two persons above, and possibly
also notify Android security team.  (Android was on linux-distros
before, but quit for lack of actionable information for them in almost
all reports.  This one report might be an exception.)

We're not a CERT, so can't promise to act as such - coordinating with
other parties.  We do have this task/role listed:

<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#contributing-back>

"4. Evaluate relevance to other parties such as the upstream, other
affected distros (not present on the (sub-)list), and other Open Source
projects, see if the report mentions notifying any of these, communicate
your findings and possible concerns to the reporter and the list, and
stay on top of the resulting discussion until a decision is made on who
else to possibly notify (or not) and any such notifications are in fact
made (with the reporter's approval)"

but so far no distro volunteered for this role (maybe distros present in
here should use your request as a reminder, and consider volunteering).

OK, this is important.

OK, I leave this to Red Hat or Debian to handle.

I don't see why.  But I'm not the one to make any use of your patches
anyway, so I'll leave this to others.

This is slightly different from our standard procedure, but OK.

Debian Bug     : 904385 918103 922306

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-14625

    A use-after-free bug was found in the vhost driver for the Virtual
    Socket protocol.  If this driver is used to communicate with a
    malicious virtual machine guest, the guest could read sensitive
    information from the host kernel.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000026

    It was discovered that Linux could forward aggregated network
    packets with a segmentation size too large for the output device.
    In the specific case of Broadcom NetXtremeII 10Gb adapters, this
    would result in a denial of service (firmware crash).  This update
    adds a mitigation to the bnx2x driver for this hardware.

CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460

    Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and Karamba Security Ltd. research
    team discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP
    implementation.  If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker
    could use these to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-8980

    A bug was discovered in the kernel_read_file() function used to
    load firmware files. In certain error conditions it could leak
    memory, which might lead to a denial of service. This is probbaly
    not exploitable in a Debian system.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.168-1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#904385, #918103, and #922306; and other fixes included in upstream
stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 and linux-latest-4.9
packages.  You will need to use "apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs"
or "apt upgrade" as the binary package names have changed.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Subject: Linux kernel: Bluetooth: two remote infoleaks (CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460)

Hi,

Ran Menscher (Bcc'ed on this message) reported two issues (crediting
"Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and Karamba Security Ltd. research team")
in Linux's Bluetooth stack to linux-distros and security@k.o on
January 1.  Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly to me, we collectively
failed to handle these issues well.  We did some things right, but not
all of those that ideally would have been done before embargo end.  From
the start, Ran was unwilling to precisely follow the linux-distros list
policy (set a tentative public disclosure date/time) and to stay on top
of the issues, instead expecting linux-distros to act more like a CERT
(coordinate with other parties), which it mostly is not.  I did point
this out to Ran, and suggested contacting Android, but I think no one
did that.  (See the third "forwarded message" below on this "not a CERT"
aspect and what can be done about it.)  The Bluetooth subsystem
maintainers didn't reply.  Distros appeared uninterested in doing
anything about the issues under embargo.  There were also numerous
occasions where I ended up substituting for other distros' roles they
had volunteered for.  And now I am doing Ran's job of making the
mandatory posting to oss-security (after a reminder yesterday).

On the bright side, I appreciate Greg KH's (security@k.o) handling of
these issues.  Greg took care of notifying the Bluetooth maintainers and
produced patches suitable for posting to the Linux lists (but still
needing review and testing), and made such postings as soon as the
embargo was over.  The thread with patches:

I also appreciate Yves-Alexis Perez (Debian) assigning the CVE IDs:

Also very helpful was Ran's answer that "According to git blame, the
issues had been introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in 2005)", and in the
first place the discovery of issues and the notification - thank you,
Ran and the Karamba Security research team!

Finally, I think it's good that we're pushing this out without further
delay (which no one requested).  Hopefully, we'll see greater progress
at handling of these issues now that the embargo is over.

I am sorry for the bitterness of my messages (including this one), which
I write from my list admin perspective.  I certainly understand that it
feels differently from a researcher perspective - for some, it'd be nice
to have a send-and-forget list, where the rest of the community would
take care of everything else.  It's just that such a list doesn't
currently exist.  There was oCERT for ~10 years, which provided this
service, but there was surprisingly little demand (vendor-sec and then
(linux-)distros saw much more use) and embargo times were much longer.

Subject: [vs-plain] two information leak vulnerabilities in kernel bluetooth stack
CC: Guy Sagy <guy.sagy at karambasecurity.com>
Date: Tue, 1 Jan 2019 09:27:59 +0000

The Linux Kernel's Blutooth stack suffers from two remote information leak vulnerabilities in the code

that handles incoming L2cap configuration packets.
These were both discovered by Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and  Karamba Security Ltd. research team.
We wish to coordinate a disclosure with all relevant parties.

BUG 1 ? HEAP ADDRESS INFOLEAK IN USE OF L2CAP_GET_CONF_OPT

VULNERABILITY
In the function l2cap_get_conf_opt (l2cap_core.c), which is used to parse configuration elements during
an L2cap connection negotiation process.
In this function, there is a ?dual use? for the output parameter ?val?. If the length of the data is 1,2 or 4, then
the returned value Is a value copied from an input buffer (received over BT) and returned ?by value?. If the
length is different, the value is returned as a pointer to the buffer ?by reference?. The buffer is from a kernel
SKB. Since the length is taken from the same buffer and the buffer is received via BT, the attacker controls
whether the val is returned as a pointer or as a value.
The val is later used as a value or as a pointer depending on a different field called ?type?, which is attacker
controlled and taken from the same buffer. The ?val? output parameter is assumed to match the ?type? and is
either used by reference or by value accordingly. This assumption is where the bug is. An attacker can send a
response where - for example ? the type is MTU (which uses 2 bytes from ?val? by-value), and the length is 3,
and so the returned MTU will actually be comprised of the 2 lower bytes of the pointer to the buffer, which
will be leaked to the attacker. It is a form of type confusion without having a sophisticated type system.

EXPLOIT
This flaw can be reached via multiple paths so there may be many ways to exploit it. One such example is using
a response with a ?rejected? result like in the known exploit for CVE-2017-1000251 for Amazon Echo, with an mtu config option sized 0
bytes. The returned mtu will then, usually, be the lower bytes of the pointer to the buffer.

EXPLOIT EFFECT
Leak bytes of heap address to attacker. Currently we only know and tested that it is possible a leak of the 2
lower bytes or a few bits of other data. bug still exists in latest kernel.

BUG 2 ? HEAP DATA INFOLEAK IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS INCLUDING FUNCTION L2CAP_PARSE_CONF_RSP
VULNERABILITY
In the functions l2cap_parse_conf_rsp, l2cap_parse_conf_req (l2cap_core.c), and other locations, there is a while loop
which is used to parse configuration elements during an L2cap connection negotiation process.
In this function, the processing of data is performed in the while loop before the check if all the data processed
is inside the buffer. In addition, if data outside of the buffer is processed, the function will not return an error.
Therefore, data that is out of bands can be processed, and in some cases returned to the attacker.
EXPLOIT
This flaw can be reached via multiple paths so there may be many ways to exploit it. One such example is using
a response with a ?pending? status as with with the known exploit for CVE-2017-1000251 for Samsung Gear S3 exploit,
and make sure the request is aligned to the SKB buffer size and contains a configuration option at the end of the buffer which is of type ?EFS? and
length 0x10 (followed by 2 0x00 bytes). This efs element is then returned to the attacker and contains 0xE
bytes of out-of-bounds heap data. It is important to keep the total returned data size smaller then the return
buff size.
EXPLOIT EFFECT
Leak several bytes of heap data to attacker. Currently we only know that it is possible process 1 configuration
option per request, the length of which is at most the size of the largest configuration element. We have
internally tested a leak using an efs configuration option, leaking approx. 12 bytes. bug still exists in latest kernel.

Date: Thu, 3 Jan 2019 10:24:32 +0000

Thank you Alexander.

The main priority is to coordinate a responsible fix prior to any disclosure.

This conflicts with the ultimatum system suggested which is more relevant to non-responsive vendors.

For this reason the previous mail had no such demands, and will for now accept any internal deadline you will decide on.

The same concern is with the bluetooth list, I hoped to reach the relevant parties via this secure list.

please aid in reaching any party relevant to fixing the issue, as long as responsible disclosure is maintained.

regarding the specific questions:

  1.  According to git blame, the issues had been introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in 2005)
  2.  This issue is different than the reference brought in that it's remotely triggered.
  3.  We would appreciate your help with assigning a CVE ID.
  4.  proper diffs: as per my understanding, the difference should be merely the reference directory for git,

       I would unfortunately request that you make use of the given patch, as it will take me far too long to make further adjustments.

as I see the next steps:

  1.  I await your fix until a deadline of your suggestion
  2.  I only intervene again if no deadline has been decided on until January 14.
  3.  I would request that a proper notification will be sent when I'm both allowed and required to inform oss-security

Thanks,

Hi,

Replying for linux-distros:

Per published linux-distros list policy, you were/are supposed to
specify a tentative public disclosure date/time (within 14 days max, so
January 14 at the latest and preferably sooner) in your very first
message.  Please do that ASAP.

Are these issues relevant to distros - in other words, when were they
introduced, what's the earliest affected version of the kernel?

Here's an example of Bluetooth issues reported a couple of months ago
and apparently being of no interest to distros:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/10/31/6>

Your report looks better (it even includes patches), yet this lack of
interest in distros doing anything on kernel Bluetooth issues might
apply here as well.

Have you already requested CVE IDs for these?  If not, would you like
linux-distros to assign CVE IDs?

And then there's Greg's request for proper diffs and question about
notifying the Bluetooth maintainers.  We'd like to have that answer,
too.  Please note that the linux-bluetooth mailing list is public, so
only send to there if/once you intend to make the issues public.

BLUETOOTH SUBSYSTEM
M:      Marcel Holtmann <marcel@...tmann.org>
M:      Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@...il.com>
L:      linux-bluetooth@...r.kernel.org
W:      <http://www.bluez.org/>
T:      git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth.git
T:      git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git
S:      Maintained
F:      net/bluetooth/
F:      include/net/bluetooth/

Last but not least, please note that as soon as the issues are made
public, per linux-distros list policy you must post about them to the
public oss-security list.  Perhaps do this at the same time with making
your postings to linux-bluetooth, linux-kernel, and netdev lists, but
separately from the posting to those lists (don't use CC, but refer to
the other posting - please see my example linked above).

Thanks,

Alexander

In my experience, this system is relevant regardless of which side the
delay would have been on.

OK, if you don't, then I set these dates/times:

January 9, 15:00 UTC - tentative public disclosure date/time (may be
postponed if a good reason is given, but will be in effect otherwise).

January 14, 15:00 UTC - the latest allowed public disclosure date/time.

> The same concern is with the bluetooth list, I hoped to reach the relevant parties via this secure list.

You did reach some Linux distros and upstream Linux kernel security
team.  To also reach Bluetooth developers, please e-mail:

BLUETOOTH SUBSYSTEM
M:      Marcel Holtmann <marcel@...tmann.org>
M:      Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@...il.com>

or reply to Greg's offer to contact them for you (which I think is what
he meant).

> please aid in reaching any party relevant to fixing the issue, as long as responsible disclosure is maintained.

My guess is you'll want to notify the two persons above, and possibly
also notify Android security team.  (Android was on linux-distros
before, but quit for lack of actionable information for them in almost
all reports.  This one report might be an exception.)

We're not a CERT, so can't promise to act as such - coordinating with
other parties.  We do have this task/role listed:

<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#contributing-back>

"4. Evaluate relevance to other parties such as the upstream, other
affected distros (not present on the (sub-)list), and other Open Source
projects, see if the report mentions notifying any of these, communicate
your findings and possible concerns to the reporter and the list, and
stay on top of the resulting discussion until a decision is made on who
else to possibly notify (or not) and any such notifications are in fact
made (with the reporter's approval)"

but so far no distro volunteered for this role (maybe distros present in
here should use your request as a reminder, and consider volunteering).

OK, this is important.

OK, I leave this to Red Hat or Debian to handle.

I don't see why.  But I'm not the one to make any use of your patches
anyway, so I'll leave this to others.

This is slightly different from our standard procedure, but OK.

><https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/01/11/2>

Since Ubuntu took over quite a few tasks (thanks!), I can suggest the
following tasks for Microsoft:

As primary, administrative: "4. Evaluate relevance to other parties such
as the upstream, other affected distros (not present on the (sub-)list),
and other Open Source projects, ...".

As backup, administrative: "3. Evaluate if the issue (or one of the
issues) is effectively already public ...".

I can also offer to act as a liason between linux-distros and
security@k.o now, and MSRC in the future.

Thanks,
Sasha

Subject: Linux kernel: Bluetooth: two remote infoleaks (CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460)

Hi,

Ran Menscher (Bcc'ed on this message) reported two issues (crediting
"Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and Karamba Security Ltd. research team")
in Linux's Bluetooth stack to linux-distros and security@k.o on
January 1.  Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly to me, we collectively
failed to handle these issues well.  We did some things right, but not
all of those that ideally would have been done before embargo end.  From
the start, Ran was unwilling to precisely follow the linux-distros list
policy (set a tentative public disclosure date/time) and to stay on top
of the issues, instead expecting linux-distros to act more like a CERT
(coordinate with other parties), which it mostly is not.  I did point
this out to Ran, and suggested contacting Android, but I think no one
did that.  (See the third "forwarded message" below on this "not a CERT"
aspect and what can be done about it.)  The Bluetooth subsystem
maintainers didn't reply.  Distros appeared uninterested in doing
anything about the issues under embargo.  There were also numerous
occasions where I ended up substituting for other distros' roles they
had volunteered for.  And now I am doing Ran's job of making the
mandatory posting to oss-security (after a reminder yesterday).

On the bright side, I appreciate Greg KH's (security@k.o) handling of
these issues.  Greg took care of notifying the Bluetooth maintainers and
produced patches suitable for posting to the Linux lists (but still
needing review and testing), and made such postings as soon as the
embargo was over.  The thread with patches:

[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047@kroah.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047%40kroah.com/)

I also appreciate Yves-Alexis Perez (Debian) assigning the CVE IDs:

Also very helpful was Ran's answer that "According to git blame, the
issues had been introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in 2005)", and in the
first place the discovery of issues and the notification - thank you,
Ran and the Karamba Security research team!

Finally, I think it's good that we're pushing this out without further
delay (which no one requested).  Hopefully, we'll see greater progress
at handling of these issues now that the embargo is over.

I am sorry for the bitterness of my messages (including this one), which
I write from my list admin perspective.  I certainly understand that it
feels differently from a researcher perspective - for some, it'd be nice
to have a send-and-forget list, where the rest of the community would
take care of everything else.  It's just that such a list doesn't
currently exist.  There was oCERT for ~10 years, which provided this
service, but there was surprisingly little demand (vendor-sec and then
(linux-)distros saw much more use) and embargo times were much longer.

Subject: [vs-plain] two information leak vulnerabilities in kernel bluetooth stack
CC: Guy Sagy <guy.sagy at karambasecurity.com>
Date: Tue, 1 Jan 2019 09:27:59 +0000

The Linux Kernel's Blutooth stack suffers from two remote information leak vulnerabilities in the code

that handles incoming L2cap configuration packets.
These were both discovered by Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and  Karamba Security Ltd. research team.
We wish to coordinate a disclosure with all relevant parties.

BUG 1 ? HEAP ADDRESS INFOLEAK IN USE OF L2CAP_GET_CONF_OPT

VULNERABILITY
In the function l2cap_get_conf_opt (l2cap_core.c), which is used to parse configuration elements during
an L2cap connection negotiation process.
In this function, there is a ?dual use? for the output parameter ?val?. If the length of the data is 1,2 or 4, then
the returned value Is a value copied from an input buffer (received over BT) and returned ?by value?. If the
length is different, the value is returned as a pointer to the buffer ?by reference?. The buffer is from a kernel
SKB. Since the length is taken from the same buffer and the buffer is received via BT, the attacker controls
whether the val is returned as a pointer or as a value.
The val is later used as a value or as a pointer depending on a different field called ?type?, which is attacker
controlled and taken from the same buffer. The ?val? output parameter is assumed to match the ?type? and is
either used by reference or by value accordingly. This assumption is where the bug is. An attacker can send a
response where - for example ? the type is MTU (which uses 2 bytes from ?val? by-value), and the length is 3,
and so the returned MTU will actually be comprised of the 2 lower bytes of the pointer to the buffer, which
will be leaked to the attacker. It is a form of type confusion without having a sophisticated type system.

EXPLOIT
This flaw can be reached via multiple paths so there may be many ways to exploit it. One such example is using
a response with a ?rejected? result like in the known exploit for CVE-2017-1000251 for Amazon Echo, with an mtu config option sized 0
bytes. The returned mtu will then, usually, be the lower bytes of the pointer to the buffer.

EXPLOIT EFFECT
Leak bytes of heap address to attacker. Currently we only know and tested that it is possible a leak of the 2
lower bytes or a few bits of other data. bug still exists in latest kernel.

BUG 2 ? HEAP DATA INFOLEAK IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS INCLUDING FUNCTION L2CAP_PARSE_CONF_RSP
VULNERABILITY
In the functions l2cap_parse_conf_rsp, l2cap_parse_conf_req (l2cap_core.c), and other locations, there is a while loop
which is used to parse configuration elements during an L2cap connection negotiation process.
In this function, the processing of data is performed in the while loop before the check if all the data processed
is inside the buffer. In addition, if data outside of the buffer is processed, the function will not return an error.
Therefore, data that is out of bands can be processed, and in some cases returned to the attacker.
EXPLOIT
This flaw can be reached via multiple paths so there may be many ways to exploit it. One such example is using
a response with a ?pending? status as with with the known exploit for CVE-2017-1000251 for Samsung Gear S3 exploit,
and make sure the request is aligned to the SKB buffer size and contains a configuration option at the end of the buffer which is of type ?EFS? and
length 0x10 (followed by 2 0x00 bytes). This efs element is then returned to the attacker and contains 0xE
bytes of out-of-bounds heap data. It is important to keep the total returned data size smaller then the return
buff size.
EXPLOIT EFFECT
Leak several bytes of heap data to attacker. Currently we only know that it is possible process 1 configuration
option per request, the length of which is at most the size of the largest configuration element. We have
internally tested a leak using an efs configuration option, leaking approx. 12 bytes. bug still exists in latest kernel.

Thank you Alexander.

The main priority is to coordinate a responsible fix prior to any disclosure.

This conflicts with the ultimatum system suggested which is more relevant to non-responsive vendors.

For this reason the previous mail had no such demands, and will for now accept any internal deadline you will decide on.

The same concern is with the bluetooth list, I hoped to reach the relevant parties via this secure list.

please aid in reaching any party relevant to fixing the issue, as long as responsible disclosure is maintained.

regarding the specific questions:

  1.  According to git blame, the issues had been introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in 2005)
  2.  This issue is different than the reference brought in that it's remotely triggered.
  3.  We would appreciate your help with assigning a CVE ID.
  4.  proper diffs: as per my understanding, the difference should be merely the reference directory for git,

       I would unfortunately request that you make use of the given patch, as it will take me far too long to make further adjustments.

as I see the next steps:

  1.  I await your fix until a deadline of your suggestion
  2.  I only intervene again if no deadline has been decided on until January 14.
  3.  I would request that a proper notification will be sent when I'm both allowed and required to inform oss-security

Thanks,

Subject: Re: [vs-plain] two information leak vulnerabilities in kernel bluetooth stack

Hi,

Replying for linux-distros:

Per published linux-distros list policy, you were/are supposed to
specify a tentative public disclosure date/time (within 14 days max, so
January 14 at the latest and preferably sooner) in your very first
message.  Please do that ASAP.

Are these issues relevant to distros - in other words, when were they
introduced, what's the earliest affected version of the kernel?

Here's an example of Bluetooth issues reported a couple of months ago
and apparently being of no interest to distros:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/10/31/6>

Your report looks better (it even includes patches), yet this lack of
interest in distros doing anything on kernel Bluetooth issues might
apply here as well.

Have you already requested CVE IDs for these?  If not, would you like
linux-distros to assign CVE IDs?

And then there's Greg's request for proper diffs and question about
notifying the Bluetooth maintainers.  We'd like to have that answer,
too.  Please note that the linux-bluetooth mailing list is public, so
only send to there if/once you intend to make the issues public.

BLUETOOTH SUBSYSTEM
M:      Marcel Holtmann <marcel@...tmann.org>
M:      Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@...il.com>
L:      linux-bluetooth@...r.kernel.org
W:      <http://www.bluez.org/>
T:      git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth.git
T:      git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git
S:      Maintained
F:      net/bluetooth/
F:      include/net/bluetooth/

Last but not least, please note that as soon as the issues are made
public, per linux-distros list policy you must post about them to the
public oss-security list.  Perhaps do this at the same time with making
your postings to linux-bluetooth, linux-kernel, and netdev lists, but
separately from the posting to those lists (don't use CC, but refer to
the other posting - please see my example linked above).

Thanks,

Alexander

In my experience, this system is relevant regardless of which side the
delay would have been on.

OK, if you don't, then I set these dates/times:

January 9, 15:00 UTC - tentative public disclosure date/time (may be
postponed if a good reason is given, but will be in effect otherwise).

January 14, 15:00 UTC - the latest allowed public disclosure date/time.

> The same concern is with the bluetooth list, I hoped to reach the relevant parties via this secure list.

You did reach some Linux distros and upstream Linux kernel security
team.  To also reach Bluetooth developers, please e-mail:

BLUETOOTH SUBSYSTEM
M:      Marcel Holtmann <marcel@...tmann.org>
M:      Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@...il.com>

or reply to Greg's offer to contact them for you (which I think is what
he meant).

> please aid in reaching any party relevant to fixing the issue, as long as responsible disclosure is maintained.

My guess is you'll want to notify the two persons above, and possibly
also notify Android security team.  (Android was on linux-distros
before, but quit for lack of actionable information for them in almost
all reports.  This one report might be an exception.)

We're not a CERT, so can't promise to act as such - coordinating with
other parties.  We do have this task/role listed:

<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#contributing-back>

"4. Evaluate relevance to other parties such as the upstream, other
affected distros (not present on the (sub-)list), and other Open Source
projects, see if the report mentions notifying any of these, communicate
your findings and possible concerns to the reporter and the list, and
stay on top of the resulting discussion until a decision is made on who
else to possibly notify (or not) and any such notifications are in fact
made (with the reporter's approval)"

but so far no distro volunteered for this role (maybe distros present in
here should use your request as a reminder, and consider volunteering).

OK, this is important.

OK, I leave this to Red Hat or Debian to handle.

I don't see why.  But I'm not the one to make any use of your patches
anyway, so I'll leave this to others.

This is slightly different from our standard procedure, but OK.

Hi,

Ran Menscher (Bcc'ed on this message) reported two issues (crediting
"Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and Karamba Security Ltd. research team")
in Linux's Bluetooth stack to linux-distros and security@k.o on
January 1.  Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly to me, we collectively
failed to handle these issues well.  We did some things right, but not
all of those that ideally would have been done before embargo end.  From
the start, Ran was unwilling to precisely follow the linux-distros list
policy (set a tentative public disclosure date/time) and to stay on top
of the issues, instead expecting linux-distros to act more like a CERT
(coordinate with other parties), which it mostly is not.  I did point
this out to Ran, and suggested contacting Android, but I think no one
did that.  (See the third "forwarded message" below on this "not a CERT"
aspect and what can be done about it.)  The Bluetooth subsystem
maintainers didn't reply.  Distros appeared uninterested in doing
anything about the issues under embargo.  There were also numerous
occasions where I ended up substituting for other distros' roles they
had volunteered for.  And now I am doing Ran's job of making the
mandatory posting to oss-security (after a reminder yesterday).

On the bright side, I appreciate Greg KH's (security@k.o) handling of
these issues.  Greg took care of notifying the Bluetooth maintainers and
produced patches suitable for posting to the Linux lists (but still
needing review and testing), and made such postings as soon as the
embargo was over.  The thread with patches:

[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047@kroah.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047%40kroah.com/)

I also appreciate Yves-Alexis Perez (Debian) assigning the CVE IDs:

Also very helpful was Ran's answer that "According to git blame, the
issues had been introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in 2005)", and in the
first place the discovery of issues and the notification - thank you,
Ran and the Karamba Security research team!

Finally, I think it's good that we're pushing this out without further
delay (which no one requested).  Hopefully, we'll see greater progress
at handling of these issues now that the embargo is over.

I am sorry for the bitterness of my messages (including this one), which
I write from my list admin perspective.  I certainly understand that it
feels differently from a researcher perspective - for some, it'd be nice
to have a send-and-forget list, where the rest of the community would
take care of everything else.  It's just that such a list doesn't
currently exist.  There was oCERT for ~10 years, which provided this
service, but there was surprisingly little demand (vendor-sec and then
(linux-)distros saw much more use) and embargo times were much longer.

The Linux Kernel's Blutooth stack suffers from two remote information leak \
vulnerabilities in the code

that handles incoming L2cap configuration packets.
These were both discovered by Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and  Karamba Security Ltd. \
research team. We wish to coordinate a disclosure with all relevant parties.

BUG 1 ? HEAP ADDRESS INFOLEAK IN USE OF L2CAP_GET_CONF_OPT

VULNERABILITY
In the function l2cap_get_conf_opt (l2cap_core.c), which is used to parse \
configuration elements during an L2cap connection negotiation process.
In this function, there is a ?dual use? for the output parameter ?val?. If the length \
of the data is 1,2 or 4, then the returned value Is a value copied from an input \
buffer (received over BT) and returned ?by value?. If the length is different, the \
value is returned as a pointer to the buffer ?by reference?. The buffer is from a \
kernel SKB. Since the length is taken from the same buffer and the buffer is received \
via BT, the attacker controls whether the val is returned as a pointer or as a value.
The val is later used as a value or as a pointer depending on a different field \
called ?type?, which is attacker controlled and taken from the same buffer. The ?val? \
output parameter is assumed to match the ?type? and is either used by reference or by \
value accordingly. This assumption is where the bug is. An attacker can send a \
response where - for example ? the type is MTU (which uses 2 bytes from ?val? \
by-value), and the length is 3, and so the returned MTU will actually be comprised of \
the 2 lower bytes of the pointer to the buffer, which will be leaked to the attacker. \
It is a form of type confusion without having a sophisticated type system.

EXPLOIT
This flaw can be reached via multiple paths so there may be many ways to exploit it. \
One such example is using a response with a ?rejected? result like in the known \
exploit for CVE-2017-1000251 for Amazon Echo, with an mtu config option sized 0 \
bytes. The returned mtu will then, usually, be the lower bytes of the pointer to the \
buffer.

EXPLOIT EFFECT
Leak bytes of heap address to attacker. Currently we only know and tested that it is \
possible a leak of the 2 lower bytes or a few bits of other data. bug still exists in \
latest kernel.

BUG 2 ? HEAP DATA INFOLEAK IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS INCLUDING FUNCTION \
L2CAP_PARSE_CONF_RSP VULNERABILITY
In the functions l2cap_parse_conf_rsp, l2cap_parse_conf_req (l2cap_core.c), and other \
locations, there is a while loop which is used to parse configuration elements during \
an L2cap connection negotiation process. In this function, the processing of data is \
performed in the while loop before the check if all the data processed is inside the \
buffer. In addition, if data outside of the buffer is processed, the function will \
not return an error. Therefore, data that is out of bands can be processed, and in \
some cases returned to the attacker. EXPLOIT
This flaw can be reached via multiple paths so there may be many ways to exploit it. \
One such example is using a response with a ?pending? status as with with the known \
exploit for CVE-2017-1000251 for Samsung Gear S3 exploit, and make sure the request \
is aligned to the SKB buffer size and contains a configuration option at the end of \
the buffer which is of type ?EFS? and length 0x10 (followed by 2 0x00 bytes). This \
efs element is then returned to the attacker and contains 0xE bytes of out-of-bounds \
heap data. It is important to keep the total returned data size smaller then the \
return buff size.
EXPLOIT EFFECT
Leak several bytes of heap data to attacker. Currently we only know that it is \
possible process 1 configuration option per request, the length of which is at most \
the size of the largest configuration element. We have internally tested a leak using \
an efs configuration option, leaking approx. 12 bytes. bug still exists in latest \
kernel.

Thank you Alexander.

The main priority is to coordinate a responsible fix prior to any disclosure.

This conflicts with the ultimatum system suggested which is more relevant to \
non-responsive vendors.

For this reason the previous mail had no such demands, and will for now accept any \
internal deadline you will decide on.

The same concern is with the bluetooth list, I hoped to reach the relevant parties \
via this secure list.

please aid in reaching any party relevant to fixing the issue, as long as responsible \
disclosure is maintained.

regarding the specific questions:

  1.  According to git blame, the issues had been introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in \
2005)  2.  This issue is different than the reference brought in that it's remotely \
triggered.  3.  We would appreciate your help with assigning a CVE ID.
  4.  proper diffs: as per my understanding, the difference should be merely the \
reference directory for git,

       I would unfortunately request that you make use of the given patch, as it will \
take me far too long to make further adjustments.

as I see the next steps:

  1.  I await your fix until a deadline of your suggestion
  2.  I only intervene again if no deadline has been decided on until January 14.
  3.  I would request that a proper notification will be sent when I'm both allowed \
and required to inform oss-security

Thanks,

Hi,

Replying for linux-distros:

Per published linux-distros list policy, you were/are supposed to
specify a tentative public disclosure date/time (within 14 days max, so
January 14 at the latest and preferably sooner) in your very first
message.  Please do that ASAP.

Are these issues relevant to distros - in other words, when were they
introduced, what's the earliest affected version of the kernel?

Here's an example of Bluetooth issues reported a couple of months ago
and apparently being of no interest to distros:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/10/31/6>

Your report looks better (it even includes patches), yet this lack of
interest in distros doing anything on kernel Bluetooth issues might
apply here as well.

Have you already requested CVE IDs for these?  If not, would you like
linux-distros to assign CVE IDs?

And then there's Greg's request for proper diffs and question about
notifying the Bluetooth maintainers.  We'd like to have that answer,
too.  Please note that the linux-bluetooth mailing list is public, so
only send to there if/once you intend to make the issues public.

Last but not least, please note that as soon as the issues are made
public, per linux-distros list policy you must post about them to the
public oss-security list.  Perhaps do this at the same time with making
your postings to linux-bluetooth, linux-kernel, and netdev lists, but
separately from the posting to those lists (don't use CC, but refer to
the other posting - please see my example linked above).

Thanks,

In my experience, this system is relevant regardless of which side the
delay would have been on.

OK, if you don't, then I set these dates/times:

January 9, 15:00 UTC - tentative public disclosure date/time (may be
postponed if a good reason is given, but will be in effect otherwise).

January 14, 15:00 UTC - the latest allowed public disclosure date/time.

You did reach some Linux distros and upstream Linux kernel security
team.  To also reach Bluetooth developers, please e-mail:

BLUETOOTH SUBSYSTEM
M:      Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>
M:      Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@gmail.com>

or reply to Greg's offer to contact them for you (which I think is what
he meant).

My guess is you'll want to notify the two persons above, and possibly
also notify Android security team.  (Android was on linux-distros
before, but quit for lack of actionable information for them in almost
all reports.  This one report might be an exception.)

We're not a CERT, so can't promise to act as such - coordinating with
other parties.  We do have this task/role listed:

<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#contributing-back>

"4. Evaluate relevance to other parties such as the upstream, other
affected distros (not present on the (sub-)list), and other Open Source
projects, see if the report mentions notifying any of these, communicate
your findings and possible concerns to the reporter and the list, and
stay on top of the resulting discussion until a decision is made on who
else to possibly notify (or not) and any such notifications are in fact
made (with the reporter's approval)"

but so far no distro volunteered for this role (maybe distros present in
here should use your request as a reminder, and consider volunteering).

OK, this is important.

> 3.  We would appreciate your help with assigning a CVE ID.

OK, I leave this to Red Hat or Debian to handle.

I don't see why.  But I'm not the one to make any use of your patches
anyway, so I'll leave this to others.

This is slightly different from our standard procedure, but OK.

Bluetooth: Check L2CAP option sizes returned from l2cap\_get\_conf\_optWhen doing option parsing for standard type values of 1, 2 or 4 octets,
the value is converted directly into a variable instead of a pointer. To
avoid being tricked into being a pointer, check that for these option
types that sizes actually match. In L2CAP every option is fixed size and
thus it is prudent anyway to ensure that the remote side sends us the
right option size along with option paramters.
If the option size is not matching the option type, then that option is
silently ignored. It is a protocol violation and instead of trying to
give the remote attacker any further hints just pretend that option is
not present and proceed with the default values. Implementation
following the specification and its qualification procedures will always
use the correct size and thus not being impacted here.
To keep the code readable and consistent accross all options, a few
cosmetic changes were also required.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1664110#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2019-01-07 17:47:35 UTC  ``` A new software page cache side channel attack scenario was discovered in operating systems that implement the very common 'page cache' caching mechanism. A page cache stores memory pages of running programs and/or libraries in use on a system to improve performance.  A malicious user/process could use 'in memory' page-cache knowledge to infer access timings to shared memory and gain knowledge which can be used to :  - Reduce effectiveness of cryptographic strength by monitoring algorithmic behaviour. - Infer access patterns of memory to determine code paths taken (ie, observe process execution patterns)  - Exfiltrate data to a blinded attacker through page-granularity access times as a side-channel.

The L2CAP_CONF_EFS and L2CAP_CONF_RFC messages can be sent from
userspace so their structure sizes need to be checked before parsing
them.

Based on a patch from Ran Menscher.

True, but we care about more than just the kernel side of things.

Can I suggest that we fork the discussion around security-bugs.rst to
LKML? I can suggest an initial patch to address your comments here but I
think that this is better handled on LKML.

My concern with Monday is timezones: we should do the math here, but I'd
like to avoid spilling over to Sunday (or very early Monday for that
matter) for some timezones.

As far as I understand specific dates for the microarchitectural bugs
were set pretty late in the process.

It's not just the microarchitectural bugs I was referring to, we are
getting security reports from users about security bugs in various
distros and we end up circling back with relevant distros to patch them
up. A recent example would be:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1834499](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1834499) where an
internal user has reported a kernel memory leak due to a missing patch
in Ubuntu.

Microsoft's history with Linux is a rather recent one. I can offer the
following examples if you're willing to give us a few months off of the
"1 year" requirement:

I'd love to develop a framework that would allow for sharing of reports
between linux-distros/security@.../MSRC given the explicit approval of
the reporter. I think that the current "silo" model is broken.

Microsoft in general, and MSRC in particular have proved during
Meltdown/Spectre that they are a trusted entity which can work well with
the open source community to advance our common goals.

I'm not a member of security@k.o, but that list isn't what we're looking
for. We've talked about this with Greg before sending this application,
and he has pointed out that security@k.o is not a disclosure list, but
rather just a way to pull in kernel folks to fix issues. Some (most?) of
the kernel bugs that get fixed don't go through that list to begin with.

The kernel's documentation with regards to security issues and
disclosure actually points to linux-distros:
<https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/security-bugs.rst> .

To complicate your question further: the Linux usage on our cloud has
surpassed Windows, as a by-product of that MSRC has started receiving
security reports of issues with Linux code both from users and vendors.
It's also the case that issues that are common for Windows and Linux
(like those speculative hardware bugs) are shared with us via MSRC as
well.

If you think that there's value in connecting between these 3
entities, I'd be happy to do so (maybe as part of a new task).

Indeed. When we debated linux-distros application internally, I tried to
do this estimate based on issues previously handled by linux-distros,
and it seemed like it would be valuable here.

With Sphere it's also hard to guess how are customers will be using it,
it's a rather unique mix of HaaS (the chip contains cores that would
belong to the user) and SaaS (where we provide mechanism to manage the
IoT device that the user will build on). I can go over this in more
detail if you'd like.

With WSLv2, users can choose to bring in a third party distro userspace
to run on top our kernel+lightweight userspace. This means that users
can be running a Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/etc userspace modified to run on
WSLv2, on top of a kernel we supply.

For us it means that we are now the proud owners of multiple
frankensteined distro userspaces as well as a custom kernel. You might
call it out as being derivative of those distros, but I believe that at
the very least this is similar to the OpenVZ/CloudLinux scenario.

Honestly, these ones are even harder to deal with than the regular IaaS
offerings we have: customers who use these offerings expect (and

Sure! Issues on the stats page that would not have been reported to MSRC
but are relevant to us would include:

 - On the kernel side, issues such as CVE-2017-7533
  (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/08/03/2>) would be
  relevant for all our offerings.

 - Core libraries affect us as well, for example CVE-2017-1000408
   (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/12/11/4>). This
   would affect our Sphere and SaaS offerings, as well as probably make
   us run through them through test gauntlet for WSLv2.

 - Higher level Linux tools, such as the one in CVE-2018-14722
   (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/08/14/7>) affect
   mostly our IaaS offerings, but I expect that we'd again validate the
   rest of our offerings with the fix.

This could be interesting for us. we already work closely with multiple
distros as part of our public IaaS offering, as well as my work
maintaining the stable tree means I interact often with many subsystem
maintainers. We could leverage that for this task.

I think that this task would also benefit from collaboration with MSRC,
where for example we could verify whether the Bluetooth issue you brought
up would affect Windows, and whether issues reported to MSRC also affect
Linux.

"Some (most?) of the kernel [security] bugs that get fixed don't go
through" linux-distros as well.

I'm not entirely happy with the wording used there, which currently is:

---
Fixes for sensitive bugs, such as those that might lead to privilege
escalations, may need to be coordinated with the private
<linux-distros@...openwall.org> mailing list so that distribution vendors
are well prepared to issue a fixed kernel upon public disclosure of the
upstream fix. Distros will need some time to test the proposed patch and
will generally request at least a few days of embargo, and vendor update
publication prefers to happen Tuesday through Thursday. When appropriate,
the security team can assist with this coordination, or the reporter can
include linux-distros from the start. In this case, remember to prefix
the email Subject line with "[vs]" as described in the linux-distros wiki:
<<http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists>>
---

This says that "Distros [...] will generally request at least a few days
of embargo", but the actual policy of (linux-)distros is that the
reporter must provide a tentative public disclosure date/time in their
very first message.

Also, this doesn't say that by disclosing something to (linux-)distros
the reporter accepts the list's policy, and leaves actually reading that
wiki page with the policy optional.

I don't readily have suggested edits, but we should address these issues
somehow.  Please feel free to suggest edits.

On a related note, this might not be representative, but I ran a Twitter
poll on days of week for vulnerability disclosures:

<https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/923885360001757185>

Poll: What days of week work best for you for public disclosure by
others of vulnerabilities in software you (or your employer, etc.) use?

23% No preference or Other
33% Mon
36% Tue, Wed, Thu
 8% Fri, Sat, Sun

164 votes

12:13 PM - 27 Oct 2017

As you can see, Mon fared really well - almost same as Tue, Wed, Thu
combined, meaning that it might be _the_ preferred day of week for
vulnerability disclosures.  So we probably shouldn't exclude Mondays.

I'm not sure.  The microarchitectural "bugs" would have been
inappropriate to bring to the distros list earlier than in 14 days prior
to their public disclosures, and I don't know if the public disclosure
dates on those were specific enough to achieve that.  Maybe you know?

Thanks!  Ideally, you'd also demonstrate that Microsoft fixed those
issues (where relevant) within days of their public disclosure (so that
some days of advance notice would have made a difference).  Can you?

Or are you merely pointing out the kind of issues that would have been
relevant to you and presumably fixed promptly now, but were not relevant
and thus were not fixed back then?  That's less than ideal if so.

If Microsoft joins for its Linux offerings (including Linux on top of
Windows), then checking if the Linux issues also affect Windows (itself)
would involve sharing beyond the need-to-know condition of
(linux-)distros list policy, so isn't allowed by default.  It could
still be done with explicit approval of the reporter, though, and I
expect most people would give such approval if asked.
