Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3783:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2019-3783
*   **Description:** Cloud Foundry Stratos versions prior to 2.3.0 deploy with a public default session store secret.
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application is using a default, publicly known secret for its session store.
*   **Weakness:** Use of hardcoded/default credentials.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious user with the default session store secret can brute-force another userâ€™s current Stratos session and act on behalf of that user. This leads to unauthorized access and potential compromise of user accounts and data.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker who obtains the default session store secret can use it to hijack active user sessions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to obtain the default session store secret, which is publicly known. Then, they need the capability to brute-force or predict session identifiers.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade Stratos to version 2.3.0 or greater.
