Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Foreman API returning sensitive compute resource credentials (passwords or tokens) in plaintext when a compute resource is deleted via the API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive credentials in API responses.
*   **Lack of Proper Handling of Secrets:** The API response was not properly sanitized to remove or mask sensitive data before being sent to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Attackers with the ability to trigger the API call can obtain plaintext credentials.
*   **Compromise of Compute Resources:**  An attacker could use the exposed credentials to gain control of the compute resources managed by Foreman.
*  **Privilege Escalation**: If an attacker gains access to credentials that have a higher permission level, they could use these to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Access:** The attack vector is through the Foreman API, specifically the endpoint used for deleting compute resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account in Foreman.
*   **`delete_compute_resource` permission:** The attacker's account must be granted the "delete\_compute\_resource" permission.
*   **API Access:** The attacker must be able to make API requests to the Foreman server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Foreman versions 1.1 and higher and was fixed in versions 1.20.3, 1.21.1, and 1.22.0.
*   A temporary mitigation is to avoid granting the `delete_compute_resource` permission to untrusted users.
*   The fix implemented involves adding a "destroy rabl" for compute resources, indicating changes to the API's response structure during deletion operations.
*   The issue was tracked as bug #26450 in the Foreman project.
*   The vulnerability was also tracked as bug 1696400 in Red Hat Bugzilla.
