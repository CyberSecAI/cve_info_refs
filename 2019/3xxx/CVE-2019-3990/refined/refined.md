Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3990:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control on the `/api/users/search` endpoint in Harbor. This endpoint was intended to be restricted to administrators, but non-admin users were able to bypass this restriction.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **User Enumeration:** The `/api/users/search` endpoint allowed unauthorized access to information about registered users due to the lack of proper access control.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The API allowed non-admin users to list all usernames, user IDs, and confirm email addresses associated with usernames.
*   **Bypass of intended restrictions:**  The API endpoint meant for administrators was accessible to non-admin users, violating the intended security policy.
*   **Insecure Search Functionality:** The search functionality did not properly sanitize the input. Using partial email matches or single characters in the username search returned more information than intended.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of User Information:** Attackers could obtain usernames, user IDs, and email addresses.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowledge of user information could be used in subsequent attacks, such as targeted phishing or brute-force attacks.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Unauthorized access to user information represents a privacy violation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** Attackers could send HTTP GET requests to the `/api/users/search` endpoint.
*   **Exploitation of API:** The vulnerability is in the REST API of Harbor.
*   **Abuse of search functionality:** Attackers could exploit the search functionality with no parameters, email filters, and username filters to retrieve user data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Valid Harbor User Account:** Attackers need to have a valid, non-admin account on the Harbor instance.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network access to the Harbor instance.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Attackers must be able to send HTTP GET requests and understand how to use the search parameters.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Nick Manfredi of Tenable Research.
*   The vulnerability affects Harbor versions 1.7.\*, 1.8.\*, 1.9.0, and 1.9.1
*   Patches were released in versions 1.8.6 and 1.9.3.
*   The fix involved requiring a complete username for search queries and removing support for querying by email.
*   There is no workaround for this issue other than upgrading to the patched versions.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
