CVE-2019-3690:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The chkstat tool in the permissions package followed symbolic links owned by regular users, then adjusts the permissions and ownership according to its settings.
  - Weakness: chkstat follows symbolic links owned by regular users, then adjusts the permissions and ownership according to its settings. The program only checks whether the final path component is a symbolic link, and even that check is subject to TOCTOU race conditions.
  - Impact: A compromised user account that can write a file/directory used by chkstat can leverage this to escalate privileges to root the next time chkstat is run on this file.
  - Attack vector: Local. A compromised user account can write a file/directory used by chkstat.
  - Required attacker capabilities: Control over a path that is traversed by chkstat. Ability to write to a file/directory used by chkstat.
