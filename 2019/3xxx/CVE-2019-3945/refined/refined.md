Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-3945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an invalid memory access within the "webserver" service of the Parrot ANAFI drone, triggered by sending a specific SDK command with an oversized Date field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Invalid memory access within the webserver when handling a specific SDK command ("g_arsdk_cmd_desc_Common_Common_CurrentDateTime") with an unexpectedly large Date field.
- The "control" service, which listens for SDK commands, does not properly validate the size of the Date field before passing it to the "webserver" service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The webserver service crashes.
- The webserver service restarts.
- This results in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition affecting the functionality of the drone.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending the specific SDK command ("g_arsdk_cmd_desc_Common_Common_CurrentDateTime") with a Date field larger than expected.
- The attack is initiated by sending the malformed command to the control service.
- The vulnerability is triggered within the webserver, where it attempts to access SDK notification module and crashes due to invalid memory access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the drone's SDK through the control service.
- No specific authentication is mentioned, implying an unauthenticated attacker could perform this attack if they have the ability to send commands to the control service.
