Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage of database credentials within Fuji Electric V-Server project files. These credentials, used for connecting to SQL servers, are saved in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Storage:** Database credentials, including usernames and passwords, are stored directly in the project file without any encryption or obfuscation. This exposes sensitive information to anyone with access to the file.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information, namely the database credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker who obtains the project file can easily extract the plaintext database credentials. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to the database server, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Access:** An attacker needs to gain access to the V-Server project files (.vpr). This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   Compromising the system where the project files are stored.
    *   Social engineering to obtain the files from legitimate users.
    *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access to the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Project Files:** The attacker must be able to access the project files where the credentials are stored.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability exists irrespective of user authentication on the V-Server itself since the credentials are in the project file.
