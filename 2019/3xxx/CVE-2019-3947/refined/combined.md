# Fuji Electric V-Server Denial of Service and Information Disclosure

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

#### CVE-2019-3946: Unauthenticated, Remote Denial of Service

Tenable discovered a denial of service vulnerability in Fuji Electric's V-Server before version 6.0.33.0. The denial of service is the result of an integer overflow that occurs while handling a crafted command 51 message sent to UDP port 8005. The following proof of concept reproduces the issue:

#### CVE-2019-3947: Plaintext Password Storage

In addition, a DB credentials disclosure vulnerability exists in V-Server project files. V-Server can connect to an SQL Server. This allows a database to be used for log storage. The DB credentials entered through the V-Server UI are saved in the project file. But it seems the DB credentials are stored in plain text, which may be viewed by unauthorized users. Below is an example project file with visible database credentials.

### Solution

Upgrade to V-Server 6.0.33.0 or later.
