## CVE-2019-3997

The content is related to CVE-2019-3997, providing a detailed analysis of the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Description:** Authentication bypass in SimpliSafe SS3 firmware 1.0-1.3 allows a local, unauthenticated attacker to pair a rogue keypad to an armed system.

**Root Cause:** The base station allows pairing of new devices after a button on the bottom of the base station is pressed, even without proper authentication. A rogue keypad (already paired to another base station) can be added to the "victim" base station.

**Weakness:** Unauthenticated keypad pairing.

**Attack Vector:** Physical access to the base station is required. The attacker needs to press the pairing button on the base station and then use a rogue keypad to pair with the base station.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Physical access to the SimpliSafe SS3 base station.
*   A rogue keypad already paired to another SimpliSafe base station.
*   Knowledge of how to put the base station into pairing mode (by pressing the button).

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can disarm the alarm system without knowing the PIN.

**Affected Products:** SimpliSafe SS3 firmware versions 1.0-1.3.

**Mitigation:** Update the base station firmware to version 1.4.x or higher.
