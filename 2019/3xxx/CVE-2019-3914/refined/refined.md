Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-3914:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw that exists due to the way firewall access control rules are processed. Specifically, when a network object with a crafted hostname is added, the hostname is incorporated into the iptables command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary commands due to insufficient input validation.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The system fails to sanitize user-provided input when creating firewall rules, allowing command injection through the hostname field of a network object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected device.
- Potential Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for complete control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Network Object Creation: The attack is initiated by creating a new network object with a crafted hostname.
- Firewall Rule Association: The crafted network object is then used in a firewall access control rule which triggers the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: An attacker must be authenticated to the device's administrative web application to perform the command injection.
- Web Interface Access: The attacker must have the ability to access the device's web interface to create and manage firewall rules.
- Network Connectivity: The attacker needs to be on the same network or have remote access to the device's web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The proof of concept shows that the command output is not directly returned in the HTTP response but can result in a root shell on the device.
- The vulnerability exists within the API backend.
- The crafted hostname needs to include backticks.
- The affected firmware version is 02.01.00.05.
