Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-3466:

**Root Cause:**

The `pg_ctlcluster` script in the `postgresql-common` package for Debian and Ubuntu does not properly drop privileges when creating temporary directories for sockets and statistics. Specifically, it creates these directories with the permissions of the `postgres` user, which can be exploited to achieve privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Directory Creation:** The `pg_ctlcluster` script creates directories used for socket and statistics with `postgres` user ownership without proper privilege dropping, even when executed in a context where it should not have those privileges.
*   **Configuration File Override:** The script uses configuration files owned by the postgres user, particularly `/var/lib/postgresql/cluster-version/cluster-name/postgresql.auto.conf` which can override settings, allowing for manipulation of `socketdir` and `stats_temp_directory` variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with access to the `postgres` account can use this vulnerability to create arbitrary directories, controlled by the `postgres` user, and then further manipulate the system to escalate privileges to root.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By setting the `stats_temp_directory` to a path where a shared object file will be loaded during sudo execution, and placing a malicious library there, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system and the `postgres` user account.
*   **Directory Manipulation:** The vulnerability relies on manipulating the `stats_temp_directory` configuration variable and creating an arbitrary directory owned by the `postgres` user.
*   **Shared Object Injection:** A malicious shared object library (`libaudit.so.1`) needs to be placed in the manipulated directory path for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the postgres user:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run commands as the `postgres` user.
*   **Ability to alter PostgreSQL configuration:** The attacker needs to be able to execute `alter system` commands to set the `stats_temp_directory`.
*   **Understanding of shared library loading:** The attacker requires understanding of how shared libraries are loaded by binaries like `sudo`.
*   **Ability to write files in specific locations:** The attacker needs to be able to create files in the exploited directory to inject malicious code.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability has been present since 2013, based on Debian git history.
*   The vulnerability is present in `postgresql-common` packages in Debian and Ubuntu.
*   The exploit involves setting the `stats_temp_directory` to a directory like `/usr/lib/sudo/haswell` and placing a malicious `libaudit.so.1` there which will get executed by sudo.
