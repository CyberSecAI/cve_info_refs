Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3839:

**CVE-2019-3839**

**Summary:** The provided documents describe CVE-2019-3839 as an unauthorized file system access vulnerability in Ghostscript due to available privileged operators not being properly secured even after the fix for CVE-2019-6116.

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that some privileged operators and dictionaries remained accessible after the fix for CVE-2019-6116. These operators should have been restricted within the `-dSAFER` sandbox environment but were not, thus allowing an attacker to access file system outside the intended constraints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Privileged Operators:** Certain privileged operators that should have been restricted within the safer mode were still accessible. This constitutes a failure to properly sanitize the environment and block sensitive functionalities that allow file system access.
*  **Safer Mode Bypass:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass the `-dSAFER` restriction, designed to limit the capabilities of PostScript execution to prevent unauthorized system access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized File System Access:** An attacker could use this flaw to access the file system outside the restrictions imposed by the `-dSAFER` sandbox.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could allow the execution of arbitrary code, potentially giving the attacker control over the system.
*   **Denial of Service:** It's mentioned that the vulnerability could result in a denial of service, though file system access and code execution is more severe.
*    **Safer Mode Bypass:** Specially crafted PostScript files could bypass safer mode protections, allowing access to the file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially Crafted PostScript Files:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or system into processing a malicious PostScript file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide a Malicious PostScript File:** The attacker needs to provide or inject a crafted PostScript file that leverages the vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Needed:**  The vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in some cases, particularly when the crafted file is processed remotely.
*   **User Interaction in Some Cases:**  Some content notes mention user interaction is required in some cases. This may mean that a user has to open or otherwise use the malicious file for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
*   Some sources indicate this vulnerability is related to incomplete protection of the attack vectors addressed in CVE-2019-6116.
*   Several different vendors patched this vulnerability, implying a broad impact.
*   The CVSS score varies between sources, especially between different versions. RedHat provides additional details about their CVSSv3 implementation on their website.

**Relevant Content:**

*   The openSUSE security update (openSUSE-SU-2019:2222-1 and openSUSE-SU-2019:2223-1) directly mention this CVE, describing it as fixing an unauthorized file system access caused by available privileged operators.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3970-1) states that Ghostscript could be made to access files or run programs if it opened a specially crafted file. It also mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution and denial of service
*   Red Hat bugzilla bug reports (1673304 and 1747956) describes the issue as a missing attack vector protection for CVE-2019-6116.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4442-1) mentions the vulnerability leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution despite the safer sandbox mode being enabled.
*   The SUSE CVE entry notes that some privileged operators remained accessible after the CVE-2019-6116 patch and could lead to a file system access bypass outside of the constrains of -dSAFER.
