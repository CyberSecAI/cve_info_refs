Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-3775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Cloud Foundry UAA (User Account and Authentication) allows users to modify their own email addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper validation or restriction on email address modifications by users, specifically the ability of a user to change their email to one already in use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A malicious, authenticated user can change their email address to that of another user, potentially leading to impersonation. This could allow an attacker to gain access to the target user's resources and perform unauthorized actions, compromising the security and integrity of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote and requires an authenticated user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected Cloud Foundry UAA instance, and be able to access the functionality used to modify their email address.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all UAA releases prior to v70.0
- The fix is to upgrade to UAA release v70.0
- The issue was reported by Daniel Le Gall of SCRT.
