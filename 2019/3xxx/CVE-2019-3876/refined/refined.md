  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2019-3876",
      "description": "A flaw was found in the /oauth/token/request custom endpoint of the OpenShift OAuth server allowing for XSS generation of CLI tokens due to missing X-Frame-Options and CSRF protections. If not otherwise prevented, a separate XSS vulnerability via JavaScript could further allow for the extraction of these tokens.",
      "root_cause": "Missing X-Frame-Options and CSRF protections in the /oauth/token/request endpoint of the OpenShift OAuth server.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Missing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection",
		"Missing X-Frame-Options header"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could generate CLI tokens for a user without their direct interaction, potentially leading to unauthorized access if the token is extracted using another XSS vulnerability.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious website could make requests to the vulnerable `/oauth/token/request` endpoint via the victim's browser.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to get a user to visit a malicious webpage, and the user must have a valid session with the OpenShift identity provider. Successful exploitation could be made easier by a separate XSS vulnerability.",
	  "affected_products": [
        "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11"
      ]
