| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1719782#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-06-12 14:35:01 UTC  ``` Token Macro Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allowed attackers able to control the contents of files processed with the ${XML} macro to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks. Token Macro Plugin no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-03-20 21:15:46 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Openshift OAuth server. An XSS vulnerability in oauth/token/request endpoint that could allow to retrieve a token for CLI usage when using non default configs.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c5)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:08:54 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Mo Khan (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c6)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:08:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the OAuth server shipped in OpenShift Container Platform version v3.0 through v3.11.  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Moderate.  For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c7)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:08:56 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Since at least v3.4, the OpenShift documentation [1] has specified the format for  corsAllowedOrigins to accurately match intended hostnames.  Since at least v3.7, installs will default to use the correct regular expression formatted variables.  Earlier versions may be configured with plain strings, a configuration which will persist across cluster upgrades, opening them to cross origin vulnerabilities such as this.   At a minimum, you should ensure that the corsAllowedOrigin definition within master-config.yaml contains elements in the form   ~~~ corsAllowedOrigins: - (?i)//my\.subdomain\.domain\.com(:|\z) ~~~  and not the form  ~~~ corsAllowedOrigins: - domain.com ~~~  as the first will permit cross origin requests only if the host matches exactly, whereas the second will permit from any host that merely contains the string (such as ABCDdomain.com or even domain.comABCD.com).    Footnotes:  [1] <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#corsAllowedOrigins>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c9)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:31:57 UTC  ``` Tracking this to the atomic-openshift component.  3.6 cluster-master: # rpm -qf /usr/bin/openshift  3.11 cluster-master: # ps -ef | grep openshift # cat /proc/(PID)/cgroup ... determine docker container ID from cgroup identifier # docker exec -ti (container) /bin/bash $ rpm -qf /usr/bin/openshift   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c10)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:43:05 UTC  ``` Additional notes:  This is limited to OpenShift ... the affected endpoint does not exist in Kubernetes.   The OpenShift OAuth server exposes a custom endpoint at <master>/oauth/token/request that can be used to get a token for CLI usage.  Without additional CSRF protections, tokens may be able to be generated without user interaction (e.g. when the user has a valid session open with the identity provider).  Due to the token being potentially generated we are left overly dependent on CORS to now prevent it from being extracted from the user's browser.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-24 21:00:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:1851 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1851](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1851)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-25 01:18:22 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-3876>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-03-20 21:15:46 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Openshift OAuth server. An XSS vulnerability in oauth/token/request endpoint that could allow to retrieve a token for CLI usage when using non default configs.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c5)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:08:54 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Mo Khan (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c6)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:08:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the OAuth server shipped in OpenShift Container Platform version v3.0 through v3.11.  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Moderate.  For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c7)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:08:56 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Since at least v3.4, the OpenShift documentation [1] has specified the format for  corsAllowedOrigins to accurately match intended hostnames.  Since at least v3.7, installs will default to use the correct regular expression formatted variables.  Earlier versions may be configured with plain strings, a configuration which will persist across cluster upgrades, opening them to cross origin vulnerabilities such as this.   At a minimum, you should ensure that the corsAllowedOrigin definition within master-config.yaml contains elements in the form   ~~~ corsAllowedOrigins: - (?i)//my\.subdomain\.domain\.com(:|\z) ~~~  and not the form  ~~~ corsAllowedOrigins: - domain.com ~~~  as the first will permit cross origin requests only if the host matches exactly, whereas the second will permit from any host that merely contains the string (such as ABCDdomain.com or even domain.comABCD.com).    Footnotes:  [1] <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html#corsAllowedOrigins>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c9)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:31:57 UTC  ``` Tracking this to the atomic-openshift component.  3.6 cluster-master: # rpm -qf /usr/bin/openshift  3.11 cluster-master: # ps -ef | grep openshift # cat /proc/(PID)/cgroup ... determine docker container ID from cgroup identifier # docker exec -ti (container) /bin/bash $ rpm -qf /usr/bin/openshift   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c10)  Dave Baker    2019-03-27 00:43:05 UTC  ``` Additional notes:  This is limited to OpenShift ... the affected endpoint does not exist in Kubernetes.   The OpenShift OAuth server exposes a custom endpoint at <master>/oauth/token/request that can be used to get a token for CLI usage.  Without additional CSRF protections, tokens may be able to be generated without user interaction (e.g. when the user has a valid session open with the identity provider).  Due to the token being potentially generated we are left overly dependent on CORS to now prevent it from being extracted from the user's browser.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-24 21:00:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:1851 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1851](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1851)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1691107#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-25 01:18:22 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-3876>   ``` |  |
