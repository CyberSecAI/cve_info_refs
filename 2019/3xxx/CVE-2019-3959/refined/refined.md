{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused because browsers automatically include session cookies when performing requests. Therefore, if the victim user is authenticated to the site, the site cannot distinguish between the forged or legitimate request sent by the victim.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can perform actions with the permissions of a victim user, provided the victim user has an active session and is induced to trigger the malicious request. For instance, an attacker could convince a victim WallacePOS user into clicking a link that, when clicked, causes a new user to be added.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked, performs an action on the application.",
       "The victim user must be authenticated to the site and be induced to click the link."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to craft a malicious link and induce an authenticated user to click on it."
