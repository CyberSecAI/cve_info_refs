Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3788:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Cloud Foundry UAA (User Account and Authentication) Release, where client configurations allow the use of wildcards in the subdomain part of redirect URIs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure redirect URI configuration: The UAA allows clients to specify redirect URIs that include a wildcard in the subdomain (e.g., `*.example.com`). This allows for a broader range of valid redirect URIs than intended.
- Open redirect: The wildcard allows attackers to redirect users to arbitrary subdomains, which can be exploited for phishing attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Phishing: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can craft a malicious link that appears legitimate but redirects the victim to a phishing site.
- Theft of access code: If a user clicks a malicious link, the attacker can obtain a UAA access code. With the access code an attacker can potentially impersonate the user or access resources associated with the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- The attacker crafts a malicious link that includes a redirect URI with a wildcard subdomain matching the UAA configuration.
- The attacker sends the malicious link to a victim.
- The victim clicks on the link and is redirected to an attacker-controlled site.
- If the victim attempts to authenticate through the crafted link, the attacker receives a UAA access code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs, and send them to potential victims.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the UAA instance, other than the ability to send crafted URLs to users.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is considered a high severity issue.
- The fix is to upgrade UAA Release to version 71.0 or greater.
