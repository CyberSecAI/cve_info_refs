- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing unauthorized access to files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can download arbitrary files from the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access, likely via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local network access and some form of authenticated access, as the CVSS score indicates a "Low" privilege is required.
