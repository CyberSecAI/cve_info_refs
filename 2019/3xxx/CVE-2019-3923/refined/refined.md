Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper validation of user-supplied input in Nessus versions 8.2.1 and earlier. This lack of proper input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the browser session of another user. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
   - Session hijacking.
   - Defacement of the user interface.
   - Unauthorized data access or modification.
   - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an authenticated, remote attacker crafting a specially crafted request containing malicious script code.
- This malicious input is then stored by the application. When other users view the stored data, the malicious script code is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Nessus.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted request to the vulnerable Nessus instance, containing the malicious script.

**Additional Information:**
- Tenable released Nessus 8.2.2 to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Tenable on 2019-01-29.
- The initial advisory release was on 2019-02-01.
