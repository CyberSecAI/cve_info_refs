Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-3807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The PowerDNS Recursor did not properly validate DNSSEC records in the answer section of responses received from authoritative servers when the AA (Authoritative Answer) flag was not set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Insufficient validation of DNSSEC signatures. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of DNS responses without the AA flag set, where the DNSSEC validation was bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could bypass DNSSEC validation, potentially leading to serving of incorrect or malicious DNS data.

**Attack Vectors:**
Crafted DNS responses from authoritative servers. Specifically, the attacker would need to send a crafted response with the AA flag not set to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS responses to a PowerDNS Recursor instance that is vulnerable. This could be achieved by controlling or compromising an authoritative DNS server that the recursor relies on, or by performing a man-in-the-middle attack between the recursor and the legitimate authoritative servers. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable recursor, as the vulnerability is triggered by the content of the DNS response, not by the source IP address.

**Affected Versions:**
PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.1.0 up to and including 4.1.8 are affected. Versions 4.0.x and 4.1.9 are not affected.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ralph Dolmans and George Thessalonikefs of NLNetLabs.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry for this issue is bug #1669151.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "Medium" severity.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry clarifies that this bugzilla entry is for community support, and that the dependent bugs are for status for individual community products.
