| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1122675#c0)  Malte Kraus   2019-01-21 15:27:47 UTC  ``` from [bnc#1119444](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1119444): > > osc/fetch.py/move_package: this builds the destination file name based on the contents of the downloaded file. An attacker with MITM capabilities can manipulate that file name to contains slashes (see osc/util/*query.py), then the package will be stored in an unintended file system location. This way, arbitrary files can be overwritten. At this point, signatures of the package have not been verified. >  > You need to bypass SSL and/or deliver from a "trusted" project for that. But > yes, the code can be improved, can you open > a dedicated report for this?  Scenario: someone builds a package they trust from e.g. a coffee shop (open Wi-Fi). (Or the ISP gets asked to fiddle with some packets.)  If I'm reading the output of 'osc buildinfo' right, OBS and IBS use plain HTTP for downloads, so TLS doesn't come into play.  I guess an evil project RPM repository does make exploiting this even easier (no man-in-the-middle required), but at least there's a scary warning when trusting a new project. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1122675#c2)  Malte Kraus   2020-03-02 12:47:47 UTC  ``` This issue will be handled according to our disclosure policy outlined in [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_disclosure_policy](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ASecurity_disclosure_policy)  The information listed here is not public. Please - do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - do not make this bug public - do not submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap) until this is public  In accordance with our policy we will make this issue public latest at  Internal CRD: 2020-05-31 or earlier  This is the latest possible date and we prefer to make it public earlier if the situation allows it. In that case we'll post a comment here setting the new date.  Only a member of the security team is allowed to make this issue public. Please speak to us if you want to take part in  the public disclosure.  In doubt please talk to us on IRC (#security) or send us a mail (security@suse.de). ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1122675#c3)  Adrian Schröter   2020-04-01 11:49:54 UTC  ``` The download protocol matters on the mirror, it can be http, yes.  But the validation happens via gpg.  So I do not see a security issue here. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1122675#c4)  Malte Kraus   2020-04-01 11:52:29 UTC  ``` I haven't looked at this in a year, but from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1122675#c0):  > At this point, signatures of the package have not been verified.  So, GPG doesn't seem to be a protection at all. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1122675#c5)  Adrian Schröter   2020-04-01 11:58:05 UTC  ``` ah, sorry ... one need to scroll in that comment to see it, sorry.
