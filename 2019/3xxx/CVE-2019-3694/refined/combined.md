We can make this bug public at any time. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-25 12:08:06 UTC  ``` similar issues in %post node 256 %post node 257 if [ $1 = 1 ]; then 258 /usr/sbin/munin-node-configure --shell | sh 259 fi 260 chown -R munin:munin %{dbdir} 261 chmod 755 %{dbdir} 262 touch %{logdir}/munin-node.log 263 chown munin:munin %{logdir}/* 264 chown root:root %{logdir}/munin-node.log* 265 chown -R nobody:nobody %{dbdir}/plugin-state/* >/dev/null 2>&1 ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2019-12-19 09:55:27 UTC  ``` can you please have look? We want to make these issue public in the near future. Thank you ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c4)  Johannes Segitz   2020-01-24 10:40:25 UTC  ``` Please submit for this ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2020-07-20 12:48:32 UTC  ``` ping, please have a look ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c6)  Wolfgang Rosenauer   2020-07-24 06:18:16 UTC  ``` Do you have hints what the correct solution is? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c7)  Johannes Segitz   2020-07-24 08:21:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wolfgang Rosenauer from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c6)) So the easiest solution would be to remove this snippets and have rpm create the files with proper permissions.   For the log files that might be tricky since you don't want to overwrite them upon update. Doesn't munin create them if they're missing? If not you can use runuser to touch them as munin directly, that's safe ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2021-06-23 11:51:40 UTC  ``` Can you please submit for this? Feel free to reach out if you have questions. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c9)  Johannes Segitz   2022-12-12 12:27:39 UTC  ``` This has been open for a really long time. Can you please work on this? Otherwise I'll file a drop request next week ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2023-01-10 17:23:31 UTC  ``` There are new maintainers. @Wolfgang: Do you want to reassign this bug to them? ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c12)  Johannes Segitz   2023-02-06 12:37:24 UTC  ``` script was dropped, thanks ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1155078#c13)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2024-06-13 15:15:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1155078) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1180707> Factory / munin ``` |  |
