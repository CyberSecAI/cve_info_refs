Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/869353. Note that while multiple products released patches for the original CVE-2014-0114 flaw, the reversion described by this CVE-2019-3834 flaw only occurred in JON 3. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2019-05-16 20:36:17 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1677721#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2019-02-15 17:12:20 UTC  ``` JON had resolved struts1 flaw [CVE-2014-0114](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0114) with <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0511.html>, but reverted the fix in a later release.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1677721#c7)  Chess Hazlett    2019-05-16 20:37:36 UTC  ``` Statement:  While the original flaw, [CVE-2014-0114](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0114), was resolved as a precaution in JON 3.2.1, later further research revealed that JON did not expose the properties in an exploitable way, and was not vulnerable.   ``` |  |

# Does CVE-2014-0114 affect Struts 1 in Red Hat products?

Solution Verified
- Updated 2024-08-05T07:13:13+00:00 -
English

* [English](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/869353)
* [Japanese](https://access.redhat.com/ja/solutions/870563)

## Environment

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
  + 5.x
* Red Hat Network Satellite
  + 5.6
  + 5.5
  + 5.4
* Red Hat JBoss Fuse
  + 6.x
* Fuse ESB Enterprise
  + 7.x
* Red Hat JBoss Operations Network (JON)
  + 3.x

## Issue

* Does [CVE-2014-0114](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0114) affect Struts 1 in Red Hat products?

## Resolution

Initial triage indicates that all releases of Struts 1 are affected by this issue. This means that all Red Hat products that include Struts 1 are potentially vulnerable. Struts 1 is no longer supported upstream, and an upstream patch may not necessarily be shipped.

The environment section of this article lists all supported Red Hat products that include Struts 1. Red Hat released the following patches:

* [RHSA-2014:0474](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014%3A0474) for RHEL 5
* [RHSA-2014:0500](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014%3A0500) for Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4, 5.5, 5.6
* [RHSA-2014:0497](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014%3A0497) for JBoss Fuse 6.1.0
* [RHSA-2014:0498](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014%3A0498) for Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0
* [RHSA-2014:0511](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014%3A0511) for JON 3.2.1

This flaw allows attackers to manipulate ClassLoader properties on the server. The impact of this depends on which ClassLoader properties are exposed. Exploits that lead to remote code execution have been published. These exploits rely on ClassLoader properties that are exposed on Tomcat 8, which is not included in any supported Red Hat products. However, some Red Hat products do expose ClassLoader properties that could potentially be exploited.

The following products expose ClassLoader properties that could be used by an attacker to read or execute files on the server that are outside the context path of the vulnerable Struts 1 application:

* Red Hat Network Satellite 5.x on RHEL 6 (Tomcat 6)
* Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0
* Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.0

The following products expose ClassLoader properties that could be used by an attacker, but for currently unknown reasons, they do not appear to be exploitable:

* RHEL 5 - Tomcat 5.5
* Red Hat Network Satellite 5.x on RHEL 5 (Tomcat 5.5)

The following products do not expose ClassLoader properties that are vulnerable to any currently known attack:

* JON 3.2.0

NOTE: [CVE-2019-3834](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-3834) was created when it was discovered that the remediation to JBoss Operations Network 3 (JON) had been reverted. The remediation to this new CVE should be the same as is for CVE-2014-0114.

## Root Cause

[CVE-2014-0094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0094) and [CVE-2014-0112](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0112) describe flaws in Struts 2, that allow a remote attacker to manipulate the class loader on a vulnerable server, potentially leading to arbitrary remote code execution. Several security researchers have identified that Struts 1 is vulnerable to a similar issue, and some of these reports use [CVE-2014-0094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0094) to identify the flaw in Struts 1. The Apache security team [has announced](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmail-archives.apache.org%2Fmod_mbox%2Fstruts-announcements%2F201404.mbox%2F%253C535F5F52.4040108%2540apache.org%253E) that Struts 1 is affected by a similar issue, and assigned [CVE-2014-0114](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0114) to the flaw in Struts 1.
