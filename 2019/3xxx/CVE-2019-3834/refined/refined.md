Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-3834:

**Root Cause:**
- CVE-2019-3834 arises from the reversion of a fix for CVE-2014-0114 in JBoss Operations Network (JON) 3. The fix for CVE-2014-0114 was initially applied in JON 3.2.1 but was later reverted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the ability of attackers to manipulate ClassLoader properties on the server.
- This manipulation could allow attackers to bypass the security context of the application.
- The core issue originates from a flaw in Struts 1, as described by CVE-2014-0114.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can allow attackers to read or execute files on the server that are outside the context path of the vulnerable Struts 1 application.
- In some cases, this could lead to remote code execution on the server.
- The specific impact depends on the exposed ClassLoader properties of the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers exploit the vulnerability by manipulating ClassLoader properties via Struts 1.
- The exact method of manipulation is not detailed, but it allows the attacker to influence class loading behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send requests that can manipulate the vulnerable Struts 1 application and its class loading behavior.
- They need to be able to reach the vulnerable server over the network.

**Additional Notes:**

- The original fix for CVE-2014-0114 was applied as a precaution in JON 3.2.1
- Later analysis determined JON did not expose the properties in an exploitable manner, which led to the fix being reverted
- However, the reversion reintroduced the possibility of exploitation if the system is later configured to expose vulnerable properties.
- While the original vulnerability (CVE-2014-0114) affected multiple products, CVE-2019-3834 specifically highlights the reversion of the fix in JON 3.
- The fix for CVE-2019-3834 is stated to be the same as the fix for CVE-2014-0114.
