# [R3] Multiple Premisys Identicard Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

The below vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Tenable for version 3.1.190 of Premisys Identicard. Latest versions of the software have not been tested due to access limitations, but are presumed to also be vulnerable.

#### CVE-2019-3906: Hardcoded Backdoor Account (Admin Access to Service)

The service contains hardcoded credentials of "IISAdminUsr" : "Badge1" that allow admin access to the service via the Premisys WCF Service endpoint on port 9003.

These credentials are unable to be changed by the user, and the only mitigation appears to be limiting traffic to this endpoint, which may or may not impact the availability of the service itself.

These credentials can be used by an attacker to dump contents of the badge system database, modify contents, or other various tasks with unfettered access.

#### CVE-2019-3907: Weak Hashing / Encryption Usage

User credentials and other sensitive information are stored with a known-weak encryption method (Base64 encoded MD5 hashes - salt + password).

#### CVE-2019-3908: Hardcoded Password (Viewing Backups)

Identicard backups are stored in an "idbak" format, which appears to be a password protected zip file. The password to unzip the contents is hardcoded into the application ("ID3nt1card"). This password is not configurable by an end user, which limits the ability to adequately protect content stored in backups.

An attacker with access to these backups could obtain access to potentially sensitive information within the backup. They could also arbitrarily modify contents of the backup, which could affect a future restore.

#### CVE-2019-3909: Default Database Credentials (Full Access to Service Databases)

The Identicard service installs with a default database username and password of "PremisysUsr" / "ID3nt1card". Instructions are provided to meet password standards when domain policies requires over 10 characters. This password is simply "ID3nt1cardID3nt1card". Users are unable to change these passwords without vendor intervention.

### Solution

IDenticard has released version 4.2 which fixes CVE-2019-3907 and CVE-2019-3908. CVE-2019-3906 was fixed in a previous release. ICS-CERT has also released a mitigation guide in their [advisory](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-031-02).

IDenticard recommends users upgrade to Version 4.2 to address all three vulnerabilities. This software update is provided free of charge. To obtain the new software update and additional information visit <https://identicard.helpdocs.io/article/8ikfxeqgdx-identicard-premi-sys-v-4-2> or contact the IDenticard Technical Support Team at (800) 220-8096.

In addition to upgrading to Version 4.2, CVE-2019-3908 requires users to set a new password for the backup/restore feature. For more information see the following link:

<https://identicard.helpdocs.io/article/s02n8lcmwg-backup-premi-sys-4-2-database-with-a-password>

**--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------**

IDenticard also recommends users change the Service Database default username and password.

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Restrict or monitor access to Port 9003/TCP.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.
