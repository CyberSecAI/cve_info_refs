**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Normal User:** No special attacker capabilities or position are needed. A standard student account within the Moodle platform is sufficient for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Moodle versions prior to 3.6.3 and 3.5.5.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in versions 3.6.3 and 3.5.5.
