- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A security vulnerability exists in a management port.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to send specific packets to the device causing a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Building a link to the device and sending specific packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to establish a link to the device, which implies local network access.
