Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The Facebook Thrift Go servers did not properly handle messages containing fields with unknown types. Specifically, when asked to skip over a field with an unknown type, the server would not return an error. Instead, it would attempt to skip the field which, in the case of a map with a large number of fields, could take a very long time to process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Lack of error handling:** The core issue is the absence of proper error handling when encountering an unknown field type during parsing.
- **Inefficient processing:** The server would enter a loop of no-op calls when attempting to skip a map with many fields of unknown types, leading to excessive processing time.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious client could send short messages containing structures with unknown types that would cause the server to spend excessive time parsing, effectively leading to a denial-of-service. The server becomes unresponsive due to being tied up in parsing the malicious message.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious client:** The attacker needs to control a client application that can send specially crafted messages with fields of unknown types.
- **Network communication:** The attack is launched by sending these malicious messages to a vulnerable Facebook Thrift server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted Thrift server.
- **Thrift message crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft messages that contain fields of an unknown type.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerability was identified in the binary protocol but is considered common to all protocols in fbthrift.
- A test case demonstrated that skipping a map with a large number of fields of unknown type resulted in almost 30 seconds of processing time.
- The fix implemented involves adding an error when asked to skip an unknown field type.
- This commit also fixes CVE-2019-3552
