# CVE-2019-3564

**Description:** Go Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages with containers of fields of unknown type. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages which would take a long time for the server to parse, potentially leading to denial of service. **Affected Versions:** This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2019.03.04.00. **References:**

Properly error when asked to skip an unknown field type

Summary:
We weren't returning an error when asked to skip over a field with and
unknown type.  In this particular test case the code attempts to skip
over a map with a large number of fields of unknown type and the ~3B
noop calls take almost 30s.  A misbehaving client could DoS a server
by sending short messages that take a long time to parse.  There may
have been other failure modes as well.

The test covers the binary protocol because that is where the issue
was found.  However, the issue is common to all protocols.

This fixes [CVE-2019-3552](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h27g-g76x-xqpw "CVE-2019-3552").
