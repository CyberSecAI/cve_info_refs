Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `strrpos` and `strripos` functions within HHVM's string handling implementation. Specifically, when negative offsets are passed to these functions, they could potentially calculate an out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The core weakness is the potential for `strrpos` and `strripos` to read memory locations outside of the intended string bounds when provided with crafted negative offset values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** By reading out-of-bounds memory, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in memory adjacent to the manipulated string. The specific impact would depend on the memory layout and what data happens to be stored there.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves passing specially crafted negative offset values to the `strrpos` or `strripos` functions.
- This could occur anywhere user-supplied data might influence these functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the offset parameter passed to `strrpos` or `strripos`. This could be through user input, data from a file, or other means of providing data to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves adjusting how the offset is handled before calling the underlying search functions ( `bstrrstr` and `bstrrcasestr`). The code now uses `len + std::min(pos + s_len, 0)` to ensure the calculated offset is within the bounds of the string.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
- The fix was implemented in commit [46003b4](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/46003b4ab564b2abcd8470035fc324fe36aa8c75), which is included in the provided data.
- The fix was included in HHVM versions 4.0.4, 3.30.5, and 3.27.8 as mentioned in the blog post.
