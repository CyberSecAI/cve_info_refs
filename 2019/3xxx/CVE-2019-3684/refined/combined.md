| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c0)  Malte Kraus   2019-04-09 09:30:31 UTC  ``` When the setup routine for SUSE Manager detects that the system has no swap, it creates a swap file with insecure permissions. The setup itself was already fixed for the upcoming SUSE Manager 4 [1]. But current versions still create these swap files with insecure permissions and any systems where this setup has run still have wrong permissions on /SWAPFILE.  1: <https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/pull/562/commits/1b426ad5ed0a7191a6fb46bb83e98ae4b99a5ade> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2019-04-09 09:43:38 UTC  ``` this is CVE-2019-3684 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c2)  Ruediger Oertel   2019-04-09 23:00:00 UTC  ``` I don't have the slightest idea why this bug ends up with me ... ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c3)  Malte Kraus   2019-04-10 08:40:50 UTC  ``` Maybe I'm doing something stupid there, Rüdiger, but 'ibs maintainer SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:Update:Products:Manager32:Update/susemanager' gives me (only) your name. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c4)  Julio González Gil   2019-04-10 09:42:23 UTC  ``` This is correctly assigned to SUSE Manager, and since I fixed for 4.0 (well, for new installations), I am the right assignee. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c5)  Julio González Gil   2019-05-13 12:35:57 UTC  ``` Fix for Uyuni (and SUSE Manager) 4.0: <https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/pull/965>  As soon as it's approved and merged, I will port back to 3.2 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c6)  Julio González Gil   2019-05-13 13:52:50 UTC  ``` SUSE Manager 3.2: <https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/pull/7802> SUSE Manager 3.1: <https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/pull/7801> ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c7)  Julio González Gil   2019-05-13 14:04:06 UTC  ``` Sorry, SUSE Manager 3.1 is  <https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/pull/7803> ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1131954#c8)  Julio González Gil   2019-05-13 15:07:18 UTC  ``` All PRs merged.  @Security, what' the procedure?
