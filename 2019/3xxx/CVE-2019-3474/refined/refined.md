Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-3474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the `/ssf/s/viewFile` endpoint of the Micro Focus Filr web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The `filename` parameter in the `/ssf/s/viewFile` endpoint is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory structure.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `filename` parameter, allowing directory traversal sequences like `../` to be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An authenticated, low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the Filr server, which can lead to information disclosure.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive configuration files like `/vastorage/conf/vaconfig.zip`, which contains the database credentials, among other things.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, `/ssf/s/viewFile`.
- **Manipulated `filename` Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the `filename` parameter within the GET request to include path traversal sequences, e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.
- **`viewType` Parameter set to `image`:** The exploit is triggered when the `viewType` parameter is set to `image`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with low privileges on the Micro Focus Filr system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Filr application server.
