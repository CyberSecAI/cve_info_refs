Throw on bad types during skipping data

Summary:
The current code silently returns on bad types. In case when we have an invalid data, we may get a container of a large size with a bad type, this would lead to us running long loop doing nothing (though we already can say that the data is invalid).

The new code would throw an exception as soon as we try to skip a value of invalid type.

# CVE-2019-3558

**Description:** Python Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages with containers of fields of unknown type. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages which would take a long time for the server to parse, potentially leading to denial of service. **Affected Versions:** This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2019.02.18.00. **References:**
