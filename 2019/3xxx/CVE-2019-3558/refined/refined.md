Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Facebook Thrift server handled messages with containers containing fields of unknown or invalid types. Instead of throwing an error immediately when encountering an unexpected type during data skipping, the server would silently proceed, potentially entering a long, unproductive loop trying to skip the invalid data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of input validation**: The server did not properly validate the types of data it received within containers.
- **Inefficient error handling**: The server did not immediately raise an error when encountering an invalid type during skipping. Instead, it would attempt to skip the invalid data leading to a resource consumption issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious client could send a specially crafted short message containing a container with a large size and bad type. This would cause the server to spend an excessive amount of time trying to parse and skip the invalid data, effectively tying up resources and preventing it from processing legitimate requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious client sends a specifically crafted message that includes a container with an invalid data type. The server attempts to process this message leading to excessive resource consumption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the vulnerable Thrift server. This likely requires network connectivity and the ability to form Thrift messages (or at least manipulate the underlying byte stream).
- No authentication is mentioned, so it's likely that an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves throwing an exception when an invalid type is encountered during skipping.
- The provided code diffs show the addition of exception throwing in `TProtocolException.cpp` and `TProtocol.py` when an invalid skip type is detected, and a test is added to check that an exception is thrown when an invalid type is encountered.
- The vulnerability exists in Python Facebook Thrift servers before version v2019.02.18.00, as per Facebook's advisory.
