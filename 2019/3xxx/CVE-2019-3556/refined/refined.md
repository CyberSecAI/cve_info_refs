Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-3556:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `dump-pcre-cache` admin endpoint in HHVM. This endpoint allows an attacker to write the PCRE cache to a file. The issue is that there was no restriction on the file path, allowing it to be written to any location the webserver user had permissions to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted File Write:** The admin endpoint `dump-pcre-cache` did not properly validate or sanitize the file path, allowing an attacker to specify any file path writable by the HHVM process.
- **Admin Endpoint Access:** The vulnerability requires access to the admin endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Creation:** An attacker could overwrite existing files or create new files with arbitrary content.
- **Potential for Code Execution:** By overwriting configuration files or other critical system files, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Admin Endpoint Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the HHVM admin endpoints.
- **File Path Manipulation:** The attacker needs to supply a malicious file path through the "file" parameter of the `dump-pcre-cache` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the HHVM server.
- **Admin Endpoint Credentials (if protected):**  If the admin endpoints are password protected, the attacker will need to bypass or have access to the credentials.
- **Knowledge of Admin Endpoint Command:** The attacker needs to know the `dump-pcre-cache` command and the "file" parameter.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in the following HHVM versions: 4.56.2, 4.78.1, 4.79.1, 4.80.1, 4.81.1, 4.82.1, and 4.83.1.
- The fix involved creating a temporary file using `mkdtemp` in `AdminRequestHandler::handleDumpStaticStringsRequest()` and `AdminRequestHandler::handleRequest()`, which are then moved into the desired path. The code also removes any existing file at the target path before creating the new one.
- The commit also adds the ability to write these files through a folly::File instead of a filename.
