Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-3981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to force a downgrade of the authentication protocol used by the MikroTik Winbox client to an older, vulnerable Diffie-Hellman implementation, even if a stronger ECSRP-5 implementation is supported.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Protocol Downgrade:** The Winbox client can be coerced into using the less secure Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, despite the availability of a more robust ECSRP-5 method.
- **Cleartext Credentials:** After the vulnerable DH key exchange, the client sends the user's username and an MD5 hash of their password (salted with an attacker-defined salt) to the server (in this case, the attacker).
- **Weak Hashing:** The use of MD5 for password hashing is considered weak and easily crackable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** A successful MitM attack allows the attacker to recover the user's username and the MD5 hash of their password. This could enable unauthorized access to the MikroTik RouterOS device and other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker needs to intercept the communication between the Winbox client and the MikroTik RouterOS device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between a Winbox client and a vulnerable MikroTik router.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the network traffic to force the client to downgrade the authentication protocol.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects MikroTik Winbox version 3.20 and below.
- It was introduced by a fix aimed at preventing MitM attacks (switching from Diffie-Hellman to ECSRP-5) that was not properly implemented.
- MikroTik was aware of the issue, but did not plan to patch within a 90 day disclosure timeframe.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for this vulnerability is available.
