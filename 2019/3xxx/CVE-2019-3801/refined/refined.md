  "CVE-2019-3801": {
    "Description": "Cloud Foundry cf-deployment, versions prior to 7.9.0, contain java components that are using an insecure protocol to fetch dependencies when building. A remote unauthenticated malicious attacker could hijack the DNS entry for the dependency, and inject malicious code into the component.",
    "Root cause": "Java components within Cloud Foundry cf-deployment use an insecure HTTP protocol to fetch dependencies during the build process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of insecure HTTP protocol for fetching dependencies."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could hijack the DNS entry for the dependency and inject malicious code into the component.",
    "Attack vector": "DNS hijacking",
     "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to manipulate DNS entries.",
      "Remote access"
    ],
    "Affected products": [
      "CredHub 2.1 versions prior to 2.1.3",
      "CredHub 1.9 versions prior to 1.9.10",
       "cf-deployment All versions prior to v7.9.0",
      "UAA Release (OSS) All versions prior to v64.0"
    ],
    "Mitigation": "Upgrade CredHub to 2.1.3 or greater for 2.1 versions, 1.9.10 or greater for 1.9 versions, cf-deployment to v7.9.0 or greater, and UAA Release (OSS) to v64.0 or greater."
