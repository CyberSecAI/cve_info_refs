Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-3786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) CLI, in versions prior to 1.5.0, does not verify the authenticity of backup scripts included in BOSH deployments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Authentication of Backup Scripts:** BBR does not check if backup scripts are legitimate, which allows malicious users to inject their own scripts.
*   **Metadata Manipulation:** A malicious user can modify the metadata file of a BBR job to include extra backup files from other jobs upon restore. This allows for the execution of scripts from unexpected sources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By modifying the metadata, an attacker can force BBR to execute arbitrary scripts on the deployment VMs during the restore process. This grants the attacker significant control over the affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Authenticated Malicious User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user who has the ability to modify the metadata of BBR jobs in the BOSH environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to interact with BOSH and the BBR infrastructure.
*   **Access to BBR Job Metadata:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the metadata associated with BBR jobs.
*   **Knowledge of BBR Scripting:** The attacker must be able to create and inject malicious scripts into the BBR workflow.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The specific exploit mentioned in the advisory was related to hooks within the cfcr-etcd-release, making clusters using that release and BBR vulnerable.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of authenticity checks on backup scripts within the BBR CLI. This can be exploited by a malicious authenticated user who can modify BBR job metadata to include malicious scripts, leading to arbitrary script execution on deployment VMs during a restore. The vulnerability is considered high severity due to the level of control it grants attackers.
