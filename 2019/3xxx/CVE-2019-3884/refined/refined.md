Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2019-3884:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the garbage collection mechanism of atomic-openshift. Specifically, the issue occurs due to a lack of proper validation of owner references across namespaces.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-namespace owner references are not properly validated.
- The garbage collection mechanism can be tricked into deleting valid child objects based on spoofed UUIDs from a different namespace.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause the deletion of valid child objects by creating OpenShift objects that spoof the parent UUID of objects in a different namespace. This can lead to denial of service or disruption of application functionality relying on those objects.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create OpenShift objects.
- The attacker needs to be able to determine the UUID of objects in another namespace, which may not be directly exposed and may be discovered through other vulnerabilities.
- The attacker then creates objects with a spoofed parent UUID belonging to the other namespace.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the capability to create objects within the OpenShift environment.
-  The attacker needs some knowledge of the target system, specifically UUIDs from other namespaces.
