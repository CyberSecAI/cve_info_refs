  "CVE-2019-3465": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the way XMLSecLibs uses XPath expressions to select Reference elements inside SignedInfo elements. The XPath expression `./secdsig:SignedInfo/secdsig:Reference` can select multiple `Reference` elements from different `SignedInfo` elements if they are children of the same parent, which leads to signature validation bypass.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect validation of cryptographic signatures in XML messages due to flawed XPath expressions used for selecting Reference elements.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could craft a malicious SAML assertion with a valid signature without access to the signing key, leading to impersonation or privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious XML document containing multiple SignedInfo elements with references and modifying the SAML assertion.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have an account in the target Identity Provider (IdP) and the ability to generate a valid SAML response from that IdP. No limitation on what is included in the malicious assertion."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of XPath expressions in XMLSecLibs when selecting Reference elements within SignedInfo sections.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The XPath expression used to locate references was too broad, causing it to include references outside of the relevant SignedInfo section.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could create a crafted XML message and have it validated as correctly signed by adding an unsigned reference to a modified assertion in another SignedInfo, bypassing signature verification.",
       "Attack vectors": "Manipulating the XML structure to include multiple SignedInfo sections and crafting a new, unsigned reference in a second SignedInfo section.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to generate a valid SAML response from a targeted identity provider."
