# CVE-2019-3795: Insecure Randomness When Using a SecureRandom Instance Constructed by Spring Security

LOW | APRIL 04, 2019 | CVE-2019-3795
# Description

Spring Security versions 4.2.x prior to 4.2.12, 5.0.x prior to 5.0.12, and 5.1.x prior to 5.1.5 contain an insecure randomness vulnerability when using SecureRandomFactoryBean#setSeed to configure a SecureRandom instance.

* Spring Security 5.0 to 5.0.11
* Spring Security 5.1 to 5.1.4
