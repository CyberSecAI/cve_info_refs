Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-3795

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of randomness when using `SecureRandomFactoryBean#setSeed` to configure a `SecureRandom` instance in Spring Security. Specifically, the issue arises when a seed is provided to the `SecureRandom` instance using `setSeed`, leading to predictable random number generation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Randomness:** The core vulnerability is the generation of predictable random numbers due to the way a seed is handled by `SecureRandomFactoryBean#setSeed`. Using a seed directly without proper initialization can make the output predictable.
- **Direct Seed Usage:** The vulnerability is triggered when an application uses `SecureRandomFactoryBean#setSeed` to set a seed for a `SecureRandom` instance, making the generated random numbers predictable if an attacker can inspect the seed and output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised Security:** The vulnerability leads to compromised security due to the predictability of random numbers. An attacker might be able to predict or guess security tokens, session IDs, cryptographic keys or other security related random material.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability is triggered only when the attacker can inspect the random material.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to Seed and Random Output:** The attack requires that an attacker has access to the seed value that was used to configure `SecureRandom` and the generated random material.
- **Application Misconfiguration:** This vulnerability is triggered by the application that provides the seed using `SecureRandomFactoryBean#setSeed` and makes the resulting random material available for inspection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to access and observe both the seed that was used and the random numbers that were generated using the insecurely configured `SecureRandom` instance. This may require access to system logs, network traffic, or other means to obtain this information.

**Affected Versions:**
- Spring Security 4.2.x prior to 4.2.12
- Spring Security 5.0.x prior to 5.0.12
- Spring Security 5.1.x prior to 5.1.5

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Spring Security 4.2.12 or later for 4.2.x users.
- Upgrade to Spring Security 5.0.12 or later for 5.0.x users.
- Upgrade to Spring Security 5.1.5 or later for 5.1.x users.
