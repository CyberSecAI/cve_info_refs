{
  "CVE-2019-3811": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in sssd. If a user was configured with no home directory set, sssd would return '/' (the root directory) instead of '' (the empty string / no home directory). This could impact services that restrict the user's filesystem access to within their home directory through chroot() etc.",
    "affected_component": "sssd",
    "root_cause": "The `fallback_homedir` option in SSSD was incorrectly returning '/' when a user had no home directory specified in the passwd file, instead of returning an empty string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect default return value",
      "Improper handling of missing configuration data"
    ],
    "impact": "Services relying on SSSD to provide the user's home directory for filesystem access restrictions (like `chroot()`) might grant unintended access to the root directory, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data exposure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Adjacent network access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a user account with an empty home directory configured. They also need to have access to a service that relies on SSSD for home directory information and that uses such information to restrict user filesystem access."
