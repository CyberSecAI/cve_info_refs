#### Impact

High

#### Details

Dell Networking OS10 versions prior to 10.4.3 contain a cryptographic key vulnerability due to an underlying application using undocumented, pre-installed X.509v3 key/certificate pairs. An unauthenticated remote attacker with the knowledge of the default keys may potentially be able to intercept communications or operate the system with elevated privileges.

Dell Networking OS10 versions prior to 10.4.3 contain a cryptographic key vulnerability due to an underlying application using undocumented, pre-installed X.509v3 key/certificate pairs. An unauthenticated remote attacker with the knowledge of the default keys may potentially be able to intercept communications or operate the system with elevated privileges.

Dell Technologies recommends all customers consider both the CVSS base score and any relevant temporal and environmental scores that may impact the potential severity associated with a particular security vulnerability.
