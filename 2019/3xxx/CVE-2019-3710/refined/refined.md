- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Dell Networking OS10 versions prior to 10.4.3 use undocumented, pre-installed X.509v3 key/certificate pairs in an underlying application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hardcoded/default cryptographic keys/certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the default keys may intercept communications or operate the system with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Knowledge of the default X.509v3 key/certificate pairs and network access to the vulnerable device.
