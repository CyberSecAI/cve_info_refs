  "CVE-2019-3701": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. The privileged user \"root\" with CAP_NET_ADMIN can create a CAN frame modification rule that makes the data length code a higher value than the available CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum calculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data (e.g. cgw_csum_xor_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag_list pointer in skb_shared_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system crash. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames.",
    "Root cause": "The CAN gateway implementation lacks proper validation of the CAN data length code (can_dlc) after modifications, allowing it to exceed the available CAN frame data size. This, combined with certain checksum calculations, leads to out-of-bounds memory writes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Use of bitwise logical operations on the length field without boundary checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "System crash, arbitrary memory rewrite, information leak (kernel stack memory)",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can create a CAN frame modification rule leading to a system crash.",
        "Physically present attacker able to attach a specially designed USB device could potentially cause a denial of service (system crash)."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (root privileges)",
       "Physical access for USB attack vectors"
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability has been present since the start in v3.2. An unprivileged user namespace is needed to exploit the bug. Those exist from SLE12 up but can code checked capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) until commit  90f62cf30a78  net: Use netlink_ns_capable to verify the permisions of netlink  messages  in v3.15-rc5 (not backported). In other words, branches based on 3.12 and newer are buggy but only branches based on 4.4 and newer can be exploited by an unprivileged user. The vulnerability is \"root only\" even on newer kernels (after considering the netlink capability check)."
