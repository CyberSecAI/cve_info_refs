- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A remote web page can inject arbitrary HTML code into the Oculus Browser UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input sanitization or insufficient checks allow arbitrary HTML injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can spoof the Oculus Browser UI and potentially execute code.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote web page is used as the attack vector, allowing the injection of malicious HTML code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host or control a web page that the Oculus Browser user visits. The attacker's web page is the source of the malicious HTML.
