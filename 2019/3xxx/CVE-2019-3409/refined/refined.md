- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate parameter verification allows unauthorized users to inject commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can control the user terminal system.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the command injection vulnerability via network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device and have access to the device's management interface.
