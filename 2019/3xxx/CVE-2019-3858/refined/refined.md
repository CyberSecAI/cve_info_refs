   "cve": "CVE-2019-3858",
   "description": "A server could send a specially crafted partial SFTP packet with a zero value for the payload length. This zero value would be used to then allocate memory resulting in a zero byte allocation and possible out of bounds read (CWE-130).",
   "affected_versions": "versions 0.3 up to and including 1.8.0",
   "fixed_versions": "libssh2 >= 1.8.1",
   "solution": "libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the length of the payload is not zero before allocing the memory buffer using the value.",
   "credit": "Reported by Chris Coulson of Canonical Ltd.",
   "attack_vector": "A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory."
