{
  "CVE-2019-3843": {
    "Description": "A systemd service that uses the DynamicUser property can create SUID/SGID binaries that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future when the UID/GID will be recycled.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect handling of services using the DynamicUser property in systemd.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "A systemd service with `DynamicUser=yes` can create SUID/SGID binaries that persist even after the service terminates, retaining the transient UID/GID.",
      "Reused UIDs/GIDs expose new services to previously created SUID/SGID binaries."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can use SUID/SGID binaries created by a previous service to access the resources of a new service reusing the same UID/GID, resulting in privilege escalation and/or access to unauthorized resources.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A compromised or malicious service utilizing the `DynamicUser` property can create a SUID/SGID binary on the filesystem.",
      "Local attacker uses the created SUID/SGID binary to execute programs with the privileges of the transient user/group.",
      "If the same UID/GID is reused by another service, the attacker can access the new service's resources."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Local access to the system.",
      "Ability to execute a compromised or malicious service that uses DynamicUser property",
       "Ability to execute the created SUID/SGID binary."
     ],
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability is fixed by restricting SUID/SGID bits on binaries created by services using the DynamicUser property using `RestrictSUIDSGID=yes`.",
        "The issue was not present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 because DynamicUser was not a feature in the systemd version shipped with that release.",
      "Affected products include Cluster Network Switch (NetApp CN1610), NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node, SnapProtect, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Fedora 30."
