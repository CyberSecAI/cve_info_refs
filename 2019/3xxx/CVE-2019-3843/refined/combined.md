| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-01 16:04:35 UTC  ``` It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the UID/GID will be recycled.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-05 12:46:49 UTC  ``` A compromised or malicious service that uses DynamicUser property could leave on the filesystem a SUID/SGID binary that would allow other users to execute programs with the privileges of the transient user/group created by systemd. If the same UID/GID is reused by another service in the future, the SUID/SGID binary can be used to access the new service's resources.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-05 13:30:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they did not include support for DynamicUser property.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c17)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-04 07:52:23 UTC  ``` Upstream patches: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/3c27973b13724ede05a06a5d346a569794cda433> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/f69567cbe26d09eac9d387c0be0fc32c65a83ada> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/9d880b70ba5c6ca83c82952f4c90e86e56c7b70c> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/7445db6eb70e8d5989f481d0c5a08ace7047ae5b> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/62aa29247c3d74bcec0607c347f2be23cd90675d> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/bf65b7e0c9fc215897b676ab9a7c9d1c688143ba>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c19)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-26 08:26:40 UTC  ``` References: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1771> [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1814596](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/systemd/%2Bbug/1814596)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c20)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-26 08:41:18 UTC  ``` Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1703356](show_bug.cgi?id=1703356 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3843 systemd: services with DynamicUser can create SUID/SGID binaries [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c21)  Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek    2019-04-26 10:58:21 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/pull/54> contains a backport for v241-stable.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c22)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-26 13:38:59 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jann Horn (Google Project Zero)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-28 15:53:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:1794 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1794](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1794)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1684607#c24)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-28 16:32:35 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1703356#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-26 08:41:12 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1703356#c1)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-26 08:41:14 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=medium  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1684607,1703356  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1703356#c2)  Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek    2019-04-26 10:57:44 UTC  ``` I/We decided to only apply the patches for this to F30. Upstream we decided to treat the issue as hardening. I backported the patches for v241-stable, but I think it's too risky to backport them to v239-stable for F29, especially that the impact of this issue is even lower in previous releases, since DynamicUser= is used even less there.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1703356#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-04-26 11:30:52 UTC  ``` systemd-241-8.git9ef65cb.fc30 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-7322053e74>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1703356#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-04-27 22:30:27 UTC  ``` systemd-241-8.git9ef65cb.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report. See [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for instructions on how to install test updates. You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-7322053e74>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1703356#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-04-29 01:41:45 UTC  ``` systemd-241-8.git9ef65cb.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [systemd](/security/cves?package=systemd) - system and service manager

## Details

It was discovered that systemd incorrectly handled certain PIDFile files.

A local attacker could possibly use this issue to trick systemd into

killing privileged processes. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2018-16888](/security/CVE-2018-16888))

It was discovered that systemd incorrectly handled certain udevadm trigger

commands. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to cause systemd

to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-20386](/security/CVE-2019-20386))

Jann Horn discovered that systemd incorrectly handled services that use the

DynamicUser property. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

access resources owned by a different service in the future. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2019-3843](/security/CVE-2019-3843), [CVE-2019-3844](/security/CVE-2019-3844))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that systemd incorrectly handled certain Polkit

queries. A local attacker could use this issue to cause systemd to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code and

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-1712](/security/CVE-2020-1712))

### Reduce your security exposure

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-7322053e74
2019-04-29 01:40:59.966408
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : systemd
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 241
Release : 8.git9ef65cb.fc30
URL : <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd>
Summary : System and Service Manager
Description :
systemd is a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts
the rest of the system. It provides aggressive parallelization
capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and
implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control
logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a
replacement for sysvinit. Other parts of this package are a logging daemon,
utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname,
date, locale, maintain a list of logged-in users, system accounts,
runtime directories and settings, and daemons to manage simple network
configuration, network time synchronization, log forwarding, and name
resolution.

This package was built from the 241-stable branch of systemd,
commit <https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable/commit/9ef65cb>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

- Fix hang in flush\_accept (#1702358) - Fix handling of RUN keys in udevd - Some
documentation and minor logging fixes - Backport the addition of
RestrictSUIDSGID= from systemd-242 and enable RestrictSUIDSGID=yes for systemd
services which use DynamicUser=yes (#1703356, CVE-2019-3843). The defaults
in v242 were changed to enable RestrictSUIDSGID=yes if DynamicUser=yes is
specified, but this backport doesn't do this and RestrictSUIDSGID=yes has to
be requested explicitly. Maintainers of other services packages for Fedora
should consider doing this. No need to log out or reboot.
