**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the super user function of Red Hat Quay.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability.
- Inadequate input validation of the service key name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the service key's name field.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with the ability to create/modify service keys can inject malicious JavaScript code into the name field.
- When an administrator accesses or attempts to modify the service key with the injected script, the script will execute within the administrator's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify service keys in Red Hat Quay.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by implementing both client-side XSS prevention and server-side validation of the service key name.
- The bug was closed in Red Hat Bugzilla on November 11, 2019.
