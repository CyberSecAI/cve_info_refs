Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-3683:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `keystone-json-assignment` package in SUSE OpenStack Cloud 8 incorrectly assigned the "member" role to users listed in `/etc/keystone/user-project-map.json` for *all* projects, instead of only assigning it to the appropriate project(s). This was due to a flaw in the package's logic before commit `d7888c75505465490250c00cc0ef4bb1af662f9f`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Role Assignment:** The core issue is that users were granted more permissions than intended. Specifically, they were granted full “member” role access to every project within the OpenStack environment.
- **Authorization Bypass:** This bypasses the intended authorization model where users should only have access to their specific projects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Users gained unauthorized access to projects they should not have been able to see.
- **Data Modification:** Users could modify, create, and delete resources within arbitrary projects, leading to potential data corruption or loss.
- **Resource Manipulation:** The ability to create or delete resources could impact the availability of services.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While users were not elevated above the 'member' role, the fact that they gained access to all projects means they bypassed the intended privilege separation between projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network Access**: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authentication Required**: The attacker needs a valid user account listed in `/etc/keystone/user-project-map.json` to exploit the vulnerability. This means that a user with at least *some* valid access to OpenStack (even limited access) could have escalated their access significantly, once authenticated.
-   **Network Access**:  The attacker must be able to connect to the OpenStack environment over the network.

**Additional Notes:**

- SUSE rated this issue as having "important" severity and has provided patches to resolve the issue.
- The CVSS v3 score is 8.8 at NVD and 8.0 at SUSE. The access vector is listed as "Network" in NVD and "Adjacent Network" in SUSE.
- The vulnerability existed in SUSE OpenStack Cloud 8, HPE Helion OpenStack 8, and SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 8.
- The issue has been resolved and fixed according to the SUSE Bugzilla entry (1124864).
