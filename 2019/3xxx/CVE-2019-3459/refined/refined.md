  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's implementation of the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP), part of the Bluetooth stack, has a flaw in the `l2cap_get_conf_opt`, `l2cap_parse_conf_rsp` and `l2cap_parse_conf_req` functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of length and type fields in L2CAP configuration packets.",
      "The output parameter `val` can be returned as a value or a pointer depending on the length of the data.",
      "The processing of data in the while loop is performed before checking if all the data processed is within the buffer.",
      "Data outside of the buffer can be processed and returned to the attacker."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a specially crafted Bluetooth packet. The response to this packet can contain part of the kernel stack, which can be used in a further attack. This can result in a heap address information leak and heap data information leak from the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted L2CAP configuration packet within the range of standard Bluetooth transmissions.",
      "Using a response with a 'rejected' result and an MTU config option sized 0 bytes.",
       "Using a response with a 'pending' status and a configuration option at the end of the buffer of type EFS and a length of 0x10."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Physical access within the range of standard Bluetooth transmission and the ability to create and send specially crafted packets.",
     "add_information": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of L2CAP configuration packets where an attacker-controlled length can cause the function to return a pointer to a kernel buffer, even when the 'type' field suggests a return by value. Also an attacker can manipulate length fields to cause the parsing to read past the end of the buffer, potentially leaking heap data. The issues were introduced in Linux-2.6.12-rc2 (in 2005)."
