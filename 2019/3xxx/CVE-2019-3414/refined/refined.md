- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the security management interface when obtaining resources of a specified operation code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XSS vulnerability. Malicious script code can be transmitted within a parameter during security management operations. The front-end does not properly process the interface response, leading to execution of the malicious script.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Execution of malicious script may lead to user cookie theft or exposure of other important information.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker injects malicious script code into a parameter that is used to obtain the resources of a specified operation code within the security management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to invoke the security management interface and supply the malicious script code within a parameter. The attacker also needs to have the ability to cause a user to interact with the page where the malicious script is rendered.
