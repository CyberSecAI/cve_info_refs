  "CVE-2019-3804": {
    "description": "The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* cockpit: Crash when parsing invalid base64 headers (CVE-2019-3804)",
    "root_cause": "The `g_base64_decode_inplace()` function in glib was used incorrectly by cockpit, leading to a crash.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted request with an invalid base64-encoded cookie, causing the web service to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "HTTP request with crafted headers"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Cockpit web service. No authentication is required.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability was fixed by switching from `g_base64_decode_inplace()` to the simpler `g_base64_decode()` function in `cockpitauth.c`. The `g_base64_decode_inplace()` function requires the len parameter to be initialized which was not done. The fix is present in cockpit version 184 and later."
