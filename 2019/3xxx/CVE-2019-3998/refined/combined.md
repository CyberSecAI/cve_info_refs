# SimpliSafe SS3 Unauthenticated Wi-Fi Config Modification

Low

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

The configuration used for connecting to a Wi-Fi network can be changed by an unauthenticated Bluetooth LE client.

There is a button on the bottom of the base station (next to the batteries) that, after being pressed, will enable Bluetooth LE on the base station. At this point,
a Bluetooth LE client can pair with the base station.

Next, the client can send a message to service "000000ff-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb" characteristic "0000ff01-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb" to modify the Wi-Fi credentials. This is done by sending a JSON via Bluetooth LE to set the "ssid", "pass", and "token".

Exploitation of this issue was most reliable if the base station had an entry sensor previously paired to it. However, this is expected.

Furthermore, the base station must be configured in one of the following states:

1. Alarm is actively connected to a Wi-Fi network.
2. Alarm is not configured with Wi-Fi credentials at all. And therefore, there is not an active Wi-Fi connection.

#### Proof of Concept

Below is a log obtained over a UART connection to the base station's ESP32 chip. The log contains boot information, an initial Wi-Fi connection to SSID 'simplitest', and finally, a malicious configuration change causing the device to connect to SSID 'christest' with password 'mypassword'.

### Solution

There is no solution at this time. SimpliSafe has indicated a fix will be available at the end of March in firmware version 1.6.

### Disclosure Timeline

 10/18/2019 - Tenable contacts [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to see if they have a PGP key.
10/18/2019 - SimpliSafe responds with a link to their key.
10/18/2019 - Tenable sends vulnerability disclosure. 90-day date is 01/16/2020.
10/21/2019 - SimpliSafe acknowledges receipt of the report and will work to reproduce the findings and complete their due diligence. It will take "a number of days."
10/24/2019 - SimpliSafe informs us that our firmware is out of date.
10/25/2019 - Tenable asks what the latest version is. There are no release notes.
10/25/2019 - SimpliSafe says the latest base station version is "1.4.58.X".
