Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-3789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Cloud Foundry Gorouter's behavior when handling route services. A space developer can create a private domain that mimics the external domain of a route service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is that the Gorouter prioritizes internal routes over external ones. This allows a malicious or compromised space developer to effectively "shadow" a route service by creating a matching private domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can redirect traffic intended for an external route service to an application they control within the Cloud Foundry platform. This enables the attacker to intercept, modify, or deny service to the intended external service. This could lead to data theft, manipulation, or a denial of service for legitimate users of the route service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the Cloud Foundry platform's API and requires the attacker to be authenticated as a space developer. The attacker must create a private domain that duplicates the external domain of the target route service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have space developer permissions within the Cloud Foundry environment.
- They need to know the external domain name of the route service they are targeting.
- They need to be able to create a private domain matching the external domain of the route service.
- They need to be able to map the private domain to an application under their control.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of Cloud Foundry Routing Release prior to 0.188.0.
- The advisory emphasizes upgrading to 0.188.0 or greater to mitigate this vulnerability.
