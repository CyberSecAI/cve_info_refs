Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-3398

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a path traversal issue in the `downloadallattachments` resource within Confluence Server and Data Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal: The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when constructing file paths, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Write: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By writing malicious files to specific locations on the server, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the `downloadallattachments` resource.
- Requires Authentication: The attacker needs to have permission to add attachments to pages and/or blogs, create a new space or personal space, or have admin permissions for a space.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account with the necessary permissions within the Confluence instance to add attachments or have administrative privileges.
- Network access to the vulnerable Confluence server is required.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of Confluence Server from 2.0.0 before 6.6.13, from 6.7.0 before 6.12.4, from 6.13.0 before 6.13.4, from 6.14.0 before 6.14.3, and from 6.15.0 before 6.15.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Fixed Versions:**
- Confluence Server and Data Center versions 6.6.13, 6.12.4, 6.13.4, 6.14.3 and 6.15.2.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "critical" severity by Atlassian.
- The vulnerability resides in the `downloadallattachments` resource.
- The exploit allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the server, which can lead to remote code execution.
- A temporary workaround is provided which involves blocking the affected URL to prevent exploitation until the system is patched.
