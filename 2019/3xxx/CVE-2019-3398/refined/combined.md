### Description

A remote attacker who has permission to add attachments to pages and / or blogs or to create a new space or a personal space or who has 'Admin' permissions for a space can exploit this path traversal vulnerability to write files to arbitrary locations which can lead to remote code execution on systems that run a vulnerable version of Confluence Server or Data Center.

**Affected versions:**

* All versions of Confluence Server from 2.0.0 before 6.6.13 (the fixed version for 6.6.x), from 6.7.0 before 6.12.4 (the fixed version for 6.12.x), from 6.13.0 before 6.13.4 (the fixed version for 6.13.x), from 6.14.0 before 6.14.3 (the fixed version for 6.14.x), and from 6.15.0 before 6.15.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

### **Path traversal in the downloadallattachments resource - CVE-2019-3398**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

Confluence Server and Data Center had a path traversal vulnerability in the downloadallattachments resource. A remote attacker who has permission to add attachments to pages and / or blogs, or to create a new space or personal space, or who has 'Admin' permissions for a space, can exploit this path traversal vulnerability to write files to arbitrary locations which can lead to remote code execution on systems that run a vulnerable version of Confluence Server or Data Center.

All versions of Confluence Server from 2.0.0 before 6.6.13 (the fixed version for 6.6.x), from 6.7.0 before 6.12.4 (the fixed version for 6.12.x), from 6.13.0 before 6.13.4 (the fixed version for 6.13.x), from 6.14.0 before 6.14.3 (the fixed version for 6.14.x), and from 6.15.0 before 6.15.2 are affected by this vulnerability.  This issue can be tracked here:

* Released Confluence Server and Data Center versions 6.6.13, 6.12.4, 6.13.4 and 6.14.3 that contains a fix for this issue and can be be downloaded from [https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives "https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-archives")

### ****What You Need to Do****

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade to the latest version (6.15.2). For a full description of the latest version of Confluence Server and Data Center, see the [Release Notes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-6-15-release-notes-965554120.html "https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-6-15-release-notes-965554120.html"). You can download the latest version of Confluence from the [Atlassian website](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download "https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download") and find our [Confluence installation and upgrade guide here.](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-installation-and-upgrade-guide-214864161.html)

**If you cannot upgrade Confluence Server to version 6.15.2 or higher.**

(1) If you have a **current feature version** (a feature version released on 4th October 2018 or later), upgrade to the **next bugfix version of your current feature version**.

   | If you have feature version | then upgrade to bugfix version: |
| --- | --- |
| 6.12.0, 6.12.1, 6.12.2, 6.12.3 | 6.12.4 |
| 6.13.0, 6.13.1, 6.13.2, 6.13.3 | 6.13.4 |
| 6.14.0, 6.14.1, 6.14.2 | 6.14.3 |

(2) If you have a current **enterprise release version** (an enterprise release version released on 4th April 2017 or later), upgrade to the **latest version of your enterprise release version.**

   | If you have enterprise release version | then upgrade to version: |
| --- | --- |
| 6.6.0, 6.6.1, 6.6.2, 6.6.3, 6.6.4, 6.6.5, 6.6.6, 6.6.7, 6.6.8, 6.6.9, 6.6.10, 6.6.11, 6.6.12 | 6.6.13 |
| 6.13.0, 6.13.1, 6.13.2, 6.13.3 | 6.13.4 |

(3) If you have an older version (a feature version released before 4th October 2018, or an enterprise release version released before 4th April 2017), either upgrade to the **latest version of Confluence Server or Data Center**, or to the **latest version of an enterprise release version**.

### Mitigation

If you are unable to upgrade Confluence immediately, then as a **temporary workaround**, you should block the affected `<base-url>/<context-path>/pages/downloadallattachments.action` URL. Disabling this URL will prevent anyone downloading all attachments via the attachments page, or the attachments macro. Downloading individual attachments will still work.

To block the URL directly in Tomcat:

1. Stop Confluence.
2. Edit `<install-directory>/conf/server.xml`.
3. Add the following inside the `<Host>`  element:

   ```
   <Context path="/pages/downloadallattachments.action" docBase="" >
       <Valapp className="org.apache.catalina.valapps.RemoteAddrValapp" deny="*" />
   </Context>
   ```

   If you run Confluence with a context path, for example `/wiki`, you will need to include your context path in the path, as shown here:

   ```
   <Context path="/wiki/pages/downloadallattachments.action" docBase="" >
       <Valapp className="org.apache.catalina.valapps.RemoteAddrValapp" deny="*" />
   </Context>
   ```
4. Save the file, and restart Confluence.

To verify that the workaround was applied correctly:

1. Navigate to a page or blog that has 2 or more attachments.
2. Go to **More options** ![](/doc/files/704577869/704577870/2/1517274795952/ellipsis.png) > **Attachments** and then click **Download all attachments**.

You should see a 404 error and no files should be downloaded.
