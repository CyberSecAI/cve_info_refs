| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1651826#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-11-21 00:38:38 UTC  ``` Bundler through version 1.17.1 creates a directory with insecure permissions in /tmp/ that, in certain circumstances, is used by Bundler to load rubygems, allowing attackers to write malicious libraries to this location and be later executed.  Bundler contains some helper code which creates a temporary directory in case a user's home directory is not present or writeable, however it creates it via non-randomized path, `/tmp/bundler/home/username`. Permissions for this directory are 0777 which allows an attacker to create subdirectory with an arbitrary username. Bundler processes started under an effective user without a home directory will load rubygems from this attacker-writable location, allowing for code execution.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1651826#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-11-21 00:38:49 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Lukáš Zapletal (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1651826#c4)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-14 04:41:43 UTC  ``` Introduced by:  <https://github.com/bundler/bundler/commit/2dfb263b0f>  It seems the first upstream release including this vuln was 1.14.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1651826#c6)  Cedric Buissart    2019-01-08 12:37:37 UTC  ``` Doran, isn't <https://github.com/bundler/bundler/commit/02e7f67727b45> (predating 2dfb263b0f) also vulnerable ?
