Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-3881:

*   **Vulnerability:** Insecure permissions on a directory in `/tmp/`
*   **Root Cause:** Bundler, through version 1.17.1, creates a directory with insecure permissions (0777) in `/tmp/` (specifically `/tmp/bundler/home/username`) when a user's home directory is not present or writable. The path is predictable.
*   **Weakness:** The insecure permissions (0777) allow any attacker to create subdirectories with arbitrary usernames within `/tmp/bundler/home/`.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can create a malicious library in the attacker-writable location.
*   **Impact:** Bundler processes, when run under an effective user *without* a home directory, will load rubygems from this attacker-controlled location, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected versions:** Bundler through 1.17.1. The vulnerability was introduced in commit `2dfb263b0f` and possibly also `02e7f67727b45`.
*   **Fixed in Version:** bundler 2.1.0
