Package        : linux
Version        : 3.16.68-2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-3846 CVE-2019-5489 CVE-2019-10126 CVE-2019-11477
                 CVE-2019-11478 CVE-2019-11479 CVE-2019-11810 CVE-2019-11833
                 CVE-2019-11884

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
    (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
    Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
    discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
    obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
    same memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-11477

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
    kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
    retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
    resource usage.

CVE-2019-11479

    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
    kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
    which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
    bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.

    This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
    (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard-
    coded value of 48.  We recommend raising this to 512 unless you know
    that your network requires a lower value.  (This value applies to
    Linux 3.16 only.)

CVE-2019-11810

    It was discovered that the megaraid_sas driver did not correctly
    handle a failed memory allocation during initialisation, which
    could lead to a double-free.  This might have some security
    impact, but it cannot be triggered by an unprivileged user.

CVE-2019-11833

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
    uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks.  A
    local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
    filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    ensure that new connection names were null-terminated.  A local
    user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-2.  Packages for PC architectures (amd64 and i386) are already
available, and packages for Arm architectures (armel and armhf) will be
available soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-05-22 18:45:25 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel. A heap overflow in mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie function in marvell/mwifiex/scan.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.  Upstream patch submission:  [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20190529125220.17066-1-tiwai@suse.de/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20190529125220.17066-1-tiwai%40suse.de/)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c5)  Wade Mealing    2019-05-28 07:34:05 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This flaw requires a system with marvell wifi network card to be attempting to connect to a attacker controlled wifi network.  A temporary mitigation may be to only connect to known-good networks via wifi, or connect to a network via ethernet.  Alternatively if wireless networking is not used the mwifiex kernel module can be blacklisted to prevent misuse of the vulnerable code.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c6)  Wade Mealing    2019-05-28 08:01:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is currently rated as Important as it is possible for an attacker to setup a wifi access point with identical configuration in another location and intercept have the system auto connect and possibly be exploited.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c9)  Petr Matousek    2019-05-30 12:55:07 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q2/133>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c10)  Petr Matousek    2019-05-30 12:56:38 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1715475](show_bug.cgi?id=1715475 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3846 kernel: Heap overflow in mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie function in marvell/mwifiex/scan.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c11)  Petr Matousek    2019-05-30 13:00:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: huangwen (ADLab of Venustech)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-10 19:00:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:2703 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2703](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2703)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-11 16:42:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:2741 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2741](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2741)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-09-12 12:45:58 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

## Details

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12984](/security/CVE-2019-12984))

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel

when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13233](/security/CVE-2019-13233))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit).

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the

Linux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A

physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15218](/security/CVE-2019-15218))

It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate data size information from the device. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15221](/security/CVE-2019-15221))

Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some

situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing

outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3701](/security/CVE-2019-3701))

Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's

HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some

situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2019-3819](/security/CVE-2019-3819))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-4095-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 ESM.

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-11833](/security/CVE-2019-11833))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel on ARM processors allowed a tracing

process to modify a syscall after a seccomp decision had been made on that

syscall. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass seccomp

restrictions. ([CVE-2019-2054](/security/CVE-2019-2054))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-4095-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

13 August 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

Jann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when

performing core dumps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11599](/security/CVE-2019-11599))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

An update that solves 11 vulnerabilities and has 167 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.1 was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-11477: A sequence of SACKs may have been crafted by a remote
attacker such that one can trigger an integer overflow, leading to a
kernel panic. (bsc#1137586).
- CVE-2019-11478: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs
which would fragment the TCP retransmission queue. A remote attacker may
have been able to further exploit the fragmented queue to cause an
expensive linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same
TCP connection. (bsc#1137586)
- CVE-2019-11479: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs
which would fragment the RACK send map. A remote attacker may be able to
further exploit the fragmented send map to cause an expensive
linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same TCP
connection. This would have resulted in excess resource consumption due
to low mss values. (bsc#1137586)
- CVE-2019-12819: The function \_\_mdiobus\_register() in
drivers/net/phy/mdio\_bus.c calls put\_device(), which will trigger a
fixed\_mdio\_bus\_init use-after-free. This will cause a denial of service
(bnc#1138291).
- CVE-2019-12818: The nfc\_llcp\_build\_tlv function in
net/nfc/llcp\_commands.c may return NULL. If the caller did not check for
this, it will trigger a NULL pointer dereference. This will cause denial
of service. This affects nfc\_llcp\_build\_gb in net/nfc/llcp\_core.c
(bnc#1138293).
- CVE-2019-12456: An issue was discovered in the MPT3COMMAND case in
\_ctl\_ioctl\_main in drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas\_ctl.c that allowed local
users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
impact by changing the value of ioc\_number between two kernel reads of
that value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability. (bnc#1136922)
- CVE-2019-12380: An issue was discovered in the efi subsystem in the
Linux kernel phys\_efi\_set\_virtual\_address\_map in
arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c and efi\_call\_phys\_prolog in
arch/x86/platform/efi/efi\_64.c mishandle memory allocation failures
(bnc#1136598).
- CVE-2019-3846: A flaw that allowed an attacker to corrupt memory and
possibly escalate privileges was found in the mwifiex kernel module
while connecting to a malicious wireless network (bnc#1136424).
- CVE-2019-10124: An attacker could exploit an issue in the hwpoison
implementation to cause a denial of service (BUG). (bsc#1130699)
- CVE-2019-12382: In the drm\_load\_edid\_firmware in
drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_edid\_load.c was an unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which
might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and system crash) (bnc#1136586).
- CVE-2019-11487: The Linux kernel allowed page->\_refcount reference count
overflow, with resultant use-after-free issues, if about 140 GiB of RAM
exists. This is related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c, fs/splice.c,
include/linux/mm.h, include/linux/pipe\_fs\_i.h, kernel/trace/trace.c,
mm/gup.c, and mm/hugetlb.c. It can occur with FUSE requests
(bnc#1133190).

An update that solves 15 vulnerabilities and has 115 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.0 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-11477: A sequence of SACKs may have been crafted by a remote
attacker such that one can trigger an integer overflow, leading to a
kernel panic. (bsc#1137586).
- CVE-2019-11478: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs
which would fragment the TCP retransmission queue. A remote attacker may
have been able to further exploit the fragmented queue to cause an
expensive linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same
TCP connection. (bsc#1137586)
- CVE-2019-11479: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs
which would fragment the RACK send map. A remote attacker may be able to
further exploit the fragmented send map to cause an expensive
linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same TCP
connection. This would have resulted in excess resource consumption due
to low mss values. (bsc#1137586)
- CVE-2019-12819: The function \_\_mdiobus\_register() in
drivers/net/phy/mdio\_bus.c calls put\_device(), which will trigger a
fixed\_mdio\_bus\_init use-after-free. This will cause a denial of service
(bnc#1138291).
- CVE-2019-12818: The nfc\_llcp\_build\_tlv function in
net/nfc/llcp\_commands.c may return NULL. If the caller did not check for
this, it will trigger a NULL pointer dereference. This will cause denial
of service. This affects nfc\_llcp\_build\_gb in net/nfc/llcp\_core.c
(bnc#1138293).
- CVE-2019-12456: local users could cause a denial of service or possibly
have unspecified other impact by changing the value of ioc\_number
between two kernel reads of that value, aka a "double fetch"
vulnerability. (bnc#1136922)
- CVE-2019-12380: phys\_efi\_set\_virtual\_address\_map in
arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c and efi\_call\_phys\_prolog in
arch/x86/platform/efi/efi\_64.c mishandle memory allocation failures
(bnc#1136598).
- CVE-2019-3846: A flaw that allowed an attacker to corrupt memory and
possibly escalate privileges was found in the mwifiex kernel module
while connecting to a malicious wireless network (bnc#1136424).
- CVE-2019-10124: An attacker could exploit an issue in the hwpoison
implementation to cause a denial of service (BUG). (bsc#1130699)
- CVE-2019-12382: An issue was discovered in drm\_load\_edid\_firmware in
drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_edid\_load.c. There was an unchecked kstrdup of
fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and system crash) (bnc#1136586).
- CVE-2019-11487: The Linux kernel before 5.1-rc5 allowed page->\_refcount
reference count overflow, with resultant use-after-free issues, if about
140 GiB of RAM exists. This is related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c,
fs/splice.c, include/linux/mm.h, include/linux/pipe\_fs\_i.h,
kernel/trace/trace.c, mm/gup.c, and mm/hugetlb.c. It can occur with FUSE
requests (bnc#1133190).
- CVE-2019-5489: The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c allowed
local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes
on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information.
(Fixing this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote
exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in
accessing public files from an Apache HTTP Server (bnc#1120843).
- CVE-2019-11833: fs/ext4/extents.c did not zero out the unused memory
region in the extent tree block, which might allow local users to obtain
sensitive information by reading uninitialized data in the filesystem
(bnc#1135281).
- CVE-2018-7191: In the tun subsystem dev\_get\_valid\_name is not called
before register\_netdevice. This allowed local users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) via an ioctl(TUNSETIFF)
call with a dev name containing a / character. This is similar to
CVE-2013-4343 (bnc#1135603).
- CVE-2019-11085: Insufficient input validation in Kernel Mode Driver in
Intel(R) i915 Graphics may have allowed an authenticated user to
potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access
(bnc#1135278).

Hi,

There is a heap overflow in marvell wifi driver in Linux kernel allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code.

Description

==========

The problem is inside mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie function in
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/scan.c.

When STA connects to AP, mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie function will be
called to update bss descriptor.In mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie function,
the IEs of beacon packet is parsed. When processing WLAN_EID_SUPP_RATES
element,it does not check the length of rates data before calling memcpy,the
dst buffer bss_entry->data_rates is a array with size
MWIFIEX_SUPPORTED_RATES(14).

Remote attacker can build a fakeAP sending malicous beacon packet with long
WLAN_EID_SUPP_RATES element(element_len>14)，when victim STA connects to the
fakeAP, will trigger the heap buffer overflow.

int mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie(struct mwifiex_adapter *adapter,

                                       struct mwifiex_bssdescriptor
*bss_entry)

{

.....

         /* Process variable IE */

         while (bytes_left >= 2) {

                  element_id = *current_ptr;

                  element_len = *(current_ptr + 1);

                  total_ie_len = element_len + sizeof(struct
ieee_types_header);

                  if (bytes_left < total_ie_len) {

                          mwifiex_dbg(adapter, ERROR,

                                       "err: InterpretIE: in processing\t"

                                       "IE, bytes left < IE length\n");

                          return -1;

                  }

                  switch (element_id) {

                  case WLAN_EID_SSID:

                          bss_entry->ssid.ssid_len = element_len;

                          memcpy(bss_entry->ssid.ssid, (current_ptr + 2),

                                 element_len);

                          mwifiex_dbg(adapter, INFO,

                                       "info: InterpretIE: ssid: %-32s\n",

                                       bss_entry->ssid.ssid);

                          break;

                  case WLAN_EID_SUPP_RATES:

                          memcpy(bss_entry->data_rates, current_ptr + 2,
//overflow!!!!!!!!!!!

                                 element_len);

                          memcpy(bss_entry->supported_rates, current_ptr +
2,

                                 element_len);

                          rate_size = element_len;

                          found_data_rate_ie = true;

                          break;

                  case WLAN_EID_FH_PARAMS:

                          fh_param_set =

                                   (struct ieee_types_fh_param_set *)
current_ptr;

                          memcpy(&bss_entry->phy_param_set.fh_param_set,

                                 fh_param_set,

Installation instructions:
+------------------------+

Upgrade the packages as root:
# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.186-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.186 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.186-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.186 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-05-22 18:45:25 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel. A heap overflow in mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie function in marvell/mwifiex/scan.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.  Upstream patch submission:  [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20190529125220.17066-1-tiwai@suse.de/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20190529125220.17066-1-tiwai%40suse.de/)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c5)  Wade Mealing    2019-05-28 07:34:05 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This flaw requires a system with marvell wifi network card to be attempting to connect to a attacker controlled wifi network.  A temporary mitigation may be to only connect to known-good networks via wifi, or connect to a network via ethernet.  Alternatively if wireless networking is not used the mwifiex kernel module can be blacklisted to prevent misuse of the vulnerable code.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c6)  Wade Mealing    2019-05-28 08:01:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is currently rated as Important as it is possible for an attacker to setup a wifi access point with identical configuration in another location and intercept have the system auto connect and possibly be exploited.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c9)  Petr Matousek    2019-05-30 12:55:07 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q2/133>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c10)  Petr Matousek    2019-05-30 12:56:38 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1715475](show_bug.cgi?id=1715475 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3846 kernel: Heap overflow in mwifiex_update_bss_desc_with_ie function in marvell/mwifiex/scan.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c11)  Petr Matousek    2019-05-30 13:00:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: huangwen (ADLab of Venustech)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-10 19:00:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:2703 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2703](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2703)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-11 16:42:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:2741 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2741](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2741)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1713059#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-09-12 12:45:58 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# USN-4117-1: Linux kernel (AWS) vulnerabilities

2 September 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems

## Details

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not

sufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking

protocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux

devices. ([CVE-2019-10638](/security/CVE-2019-10638))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12984](/security/CVE-2019-12984))

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel

when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13233](/security/CVE-2019-13233))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-14283](/security/CVE-2019-14283))

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-14284](/security/CVE-2019-14284))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the

virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.

([CVE-2019-3900](/security/CVE-2019-3900))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 19.04

* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [5.0.0.1014.15](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/5.0.0-1014.16)
* [linux-image-5.0.0-1014-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [5.0.0-1014.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/5.0.0-1014.16)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 928989

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
    (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
    Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
    discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
    obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
    same memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503

    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access
    validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), which a
    attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-11477

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
    kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
    retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
    resource usage.

CVE-2019-11479

    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
    kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
    which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
    bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.

    This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
    (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard-
    coded value of 48.  We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
    that your network requires a lower value.

CVE-2019-11486

    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the
    Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to
    cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been
    disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
    implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-11815

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram
    Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially
    privilege escalation.  This protocol module (rds) is not auto-
    loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where
    it is explicitly loaded.

CVE-2019-11833

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
    uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks.  A
    local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
    filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    ensure that new connection names were null-terminated.  A local
    user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.168-1+deb9u3~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 42.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 15 vulnerabilities and has 62 fixes
is now available.
Description:
Example: The openSUSE Leap 42.3 kernel was updated to 4.4.180 to receive
various security and bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-11477: A sequence of SACKs may have been crafted by a remote
attacker such that one can trigger an integer overflow, leading to a
kernel panic. (bsc#1137586).
- CVE-2019-11478: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs
which would fragment the TCP retransmission queue. A remote attacker may
have been able to further exploit the fragmented queue to cause an
expensive linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same
TCP connection. (bsc#1137586)
- CVE-2019-11479: It was possible to send a crafted sequence of SACKs
which would fragment the RACK send map. A remote attacker may be able to
further exploit the fragmented send map to cause an expensive
linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same TCP
connection. This would have resulted in excess resource consumption due
to low mss values. (bsc#1137586)
- CVE-2019-12819: The function \_\_mdiobus\_register() in
drivers/net/phy/mdio\_bus.c calls put\_device(), which will trigger a
fixed\_mdio\_bus\_init use-after-free. This will cause a denial of service
(bnc#1138291).
- CVE-2019-12818: The nfc\_llcp\_build\_tlv function in
net/nfc/llcp\_commands.c may return NULL. If the caller did not check for
this, it will trigger a NULL pointer dereference. This will cause denial
of service. This affects nfc\_llcp\_build\_gb in net/nfc/llcp\_core.c
(bnc#1138293).
- CVE-2019-12456: An issue was discovered in the MPT3COMMAND case in
\_ctl\_ioctl\_main in drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas\_ctl.c that allowed local
users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
impact by changing the value of ioc\_number between two kernel reads of
that value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability (bnc#1136922).
- CVE-2019-12380: phys\_efi\_set\_virtual\_address\_map in
arch/x86/platform/efi/efi.c and efi\_call\_phys\_prolog in
arch/x86/platform/efi/efi\_64.c mishandle memory allocation failures
(bnc#1136598).
- CVE-2019-11487: The Linux kernel allowed page->\_refcount reference count
overflow, with resultant use-after-free issues, if about 140 GiB of RAM
exists. This is related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c, fs/splice.c,
include/linux/mm.h, include/linux/pipe\_fs\_i.h, kernel/trace/trace.c,
mm/gup.c, and mm/hugetlb.c. It can occur with FUSE requests
(bnc#1133190).
- CVE-2019-3846: A flaw that allowed an attacker to corrupt memory and
possibly escalate privileges was found in the mwifiex kernel module
while connecting to a malicious wireless network (bnc#1136424).
- CVE-2019-12382: An issue was discovered in drm\_load\_edid\_firmware in
drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_edid\_load.c. There was an unchecked kstrdup of
fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and system crash) (bnc#1136586).
- CVE-2019-5489: The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c allowed
local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes
on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information.
(Fixing this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote
exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in
accessing public files from an Apache HTTP Server (bnc#1120843).
- CVE-2019-11833: fs/ext4/extents.c did not zero out the unused memory
region in the extent tree block, which might allow local users to obtain
sensitive information by reading uninitialized data in the filesystem
(bnc#1135281).
- CVE-2018-7191: In the tun subsystem dev\_get\_valid\_name is not called
before register\_netdevice. This allowed local users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) via an ioctl(TUNSETIFF)
call with a dev name containing a / character. This is similar to
CVE-2013-4343 (bnc#1135603).
- CVE-2019-11190, CVE-2019-11191: The Linux kernel allowed local users to
bypass ASLR on setuid programs (such as /bin/su) because
install\_exec\_creds() is called too late in load\_elf\_binary() in
fs/binfmt\_elf.c, and thus the ptrace\_may\_access() check has a race
condition when reading /proc/pid/stat (bnc#1131543 bnc#1132374
bnc#1132472).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1720616#c0)  msiddiqu    2019-06-14 11:20:20 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem on certain 64-bit PowerPC with the hash page table MMU handled memory above 512TB. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.  Upstream commit that introduced this issue: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f384796c40dc>  Upstream fix: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ca72d88378b2f2444d3ec145dd442d449d3fefbc>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1720616#c1)  Petr Matousek    2019-06-14 12:49:56 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1720341](show_bug.cgi?id=1720341) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1720616#c2)  Petr Matousek    2019-06-24 09:44:02 UTC  ``` Note from the reporter:  This bug only affects machines using 64-bit CPUs with the hash page table MMU, see below for more detail on affected CPUs.  To trigger the bug a process must allocate memory above 512TB. That only happens if userspace explicitly requests it with mmap(). That process must then fork(), at this point the child incorrectly inherits the "context id" of the parent associated with the mapping above 512TB. It may then be possible for the parent/child to write to each other's mappings above 512TB, which should not be possible, and constitutes memory corruption.  If instead the child process exits, all its context ids are freed, including the context id that is still in use by the parent for the mapping above 512TB. That id can then be reallocated to a third process, that process can then read/write to the parent's mapping above 512TB. Additionally if the freed id is used for the third process's primary context id, then the parent is able to read/write to the third process's mappings *below* 512TB.  If the parent and child both exit before another process is allocated the freed context id, the kernel will notice the double free of the id and print a warning such as:  ida_free called for id=103 which is not allocated. WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 7293 at lib/idr.c:520 ida_free_rc+0x1b4/0x1d0  Only machines using the hash page table (HPT) MMU are affected, eg. PowerPC 970 (G5), PA6T, Power5/6/7/8/9. By default Power9 bare metal machines (powernv) use the Radix MMU and are not affected, unless the machine has been explicitly booted in HPT mode (using disable_radix on the kernel command line). KVM guests on Power9 may be affected if the host or guest is configured to use the HPT MMU. LPARs under PowerVM on Power9 are affected as they always use the HPT MMU. Kernels built with PAGE_SIZE=4K are not affected.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1720616#c3)  Petr Matousek    2019-06-24 09:46:09 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Ellerman   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1720616#c4)  Petr Matousek    2019-06-24 09:48:39 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue. Updates will be released as they become available.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1720616#c8)  Marian Rehak    2019-06-25 08:06:05 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1723697](show_bug.cgi?id=1723697 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-12817 kernel: ppc: unrelated processes being able to read/write to each other's virtual memory [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1720616#c9)  Petr Matousek    2019-06-25 09:16:03 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q2/200>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1720616#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-10 19:00:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:2703 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2703](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2703)   ``` |  |

                 CVE-2019-11884
Debian Bug     : 928989

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
    (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
    Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
    discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
    obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
    same memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503

    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access
    validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), which a
    attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-11477

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
    kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
    retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
    resource usage.

CVE-2019-11479

    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
    kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
    which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
    bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.

    This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
    (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard-
    coded value of 48.  We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
    that your network requires a lower value.

CVE-2019-11486

    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the
    Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to
    cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been
    disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
    implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-11815

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram
    Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially
    privilege escalation.  This protocol module (rds) is not auto-
    loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where
    it is explicitly loaded.

CVE-2019-11833

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
    uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks.  A
    local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
    filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    ensure that new connection names were null-terminated.  A local
    user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

tracker page at:

# CVE-2019-5489

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-5482.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-5544.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5489 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5489)

#### Description

The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13 allowed local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information. (Fixing this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in accessing public files from an Apache HTTP Server.

                 CVE-2019-11884
Debian Bug     : 928989

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
    (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
    Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
    discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
    obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
    same memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503

    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access
    validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), which a
    attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-11477

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
    kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
    retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
    resource usage.

CVE-2019-11479

    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
    kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
    which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
    bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.

    This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
    (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard-
    coded value of 48.  We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
    that your network requires a lower value.

CVE-2019-11486

    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the
    Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to
    cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been
    disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
    implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-11815

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram
    Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially
    privilege escalation.  This protocol module (rds) is not auto-
    loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where
    it is explicitly loaded.

CVE-2019-11833

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
    uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks.  A
    local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
    filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    ensure that new connection names were null-terminated.  A local
    user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
