Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3731:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a timing discrepancy in the RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition and Micro Edition Suite. This timing discrepancy can be observed by an attacker, which can then be used to extract sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the software processes cryptographic operations, leading to variations in execution time depending on the input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious remote user can potentially exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information, potentially leading to data exposure.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be remote, and needs to be able to observe timing differences in the processing of cryptographic operations. The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction. It does however have a High complexity.

**Affected Versions**
- RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition versions before 4.1.4
- RSA Micro Edition Suite versions before 4.4
