Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-3396:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a server-side template injection flaw within the Widget Connector macro of Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center. Specifically, the `_template` parameter in the macro is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code into a Velocity template.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of the `_template` parameter, which allows the injection of malicious code into the Velocity template engine.
- **Path Traversal:**  The vulnerability also facilitates path traversal by injecting relative paths into the template parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the Confluence server.
- **Arbitrary File Read:**  The vulnerability can also be used to achieve arbitrary file read.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/rest/tinymce/1/macro/preview` endpoint. This request includes a `widget` macro with a malicious `_template` parameter, pointing to a malicious file on the attacker's server.
- The `url` parameter within the `widget` macro is used to trigger the vulnerability, but it can point to any external video service. The important factor is that the `_template` parameter is processed by the Velocity template engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to a vulnerable Confluence server.
- The attacker needs to have a server hosting malicious Velocity templates or use a ftp server.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center versions before 6.6.12, from version 6.7.0 before 6.12.3, from version 6.13.0 before 6.13.3, and from version 6.14.0 before 6.14.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Daniil Dmitriev.
- The fix involves sanitizing the `_template` parameter by removing it before rendering the HTML output.
- The exploit can be performed by using Metasploit.
