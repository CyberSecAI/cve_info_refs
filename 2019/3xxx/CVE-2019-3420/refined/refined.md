- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Information leak vulnerability in ZTE ZXHN H108N product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could obtain sensitive information and perform unauthorized operations.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly specified, but the CVSS vector implies adjacent network access (AV:A).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within the adjacent network (AV:A) and requires no privileges or user interaction (PR:N/UI:N).
