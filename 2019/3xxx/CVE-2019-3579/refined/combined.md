# [Exponential Project Update](https://blog.mybb.com/2024/07/03/exponential-project-update/)

Posted on [July 3, 2024](https://blog.mybb.com/2024/07/03/exponential-project-update/ "6:56 pm")  by  [MyBB Team](https://blog.mybb.com/author/mybbteam/ "View all posts by MyBB Team")

![mybb-exponential@4x](https://blog.mybb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mybb-exponential404x.png)

MyBB’s ecosystem spans across several platforms connecting contributors, authors, and users. In this post, we’ll collect a number of recent highlights from around the Project.

## 10³ Stars on GitHub

Software is often divided into [closed- and open-style development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar).

Back in [2009](//blog.mybb.com/2009/08/19/getting-involved-development-site-opens/%29), MyBB switched from the former to the latter, enabling administrators and developers, who tweak their forums in the most random ways, to submit and see their fixes in official releases. The move also opened up the development process and allowed a crowd of enthusiasts to critique any upcoming changes and test them on their own servers, and with custom plugins.

Since then, code from 100+ contributors has made its way into MyBB, and earlier this year, the Project’s [main repository](https://github.com/mybb/mybb) passed the symbolic threshold of **1K stars** from members of the open source community.

If you have patches of your own, or would like to otherwise make MyBB a better forum software, explore some of the options in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/feature/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## 10² Stars for Top Extensions

If you’ve been using MyBB, you’ll know that the core package is only a part of its identity: extensions have an important place in the ecosystem that’s been maturing for two decades.

Today, the [Extend platform](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php) hosts over 1300 projects that have published more than five thousand releases downloaded well over two million times, and a pair of extensions have already crossed the **100-star mark** — taking a portion of over 6.5 thousand stars given in total.

Starring projects allows you to find them in a [single place](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=panel&panelaction=stars) when you’re ready to start your new forum, and subscribing to them (which was done more than a thousand times) will notify you of new releases to check out.

As we work to define MyBB as lightweight software with modern features,
we aim to further strengthen extensions as a pillar of the application by [building](https://github.com/orgs/mybb/projects/3/views/3) authoring aids and APIs into the core to make the experience easier and more pleasant for everyone involved.

## 10¹ Development News

In recent months, numerous key elements of the upcoming series have taken shape. Read ten notes about the View system, extending MyBB, merged features, requirements, and upcoming works in the [**1.9 Development Milestone**](https://community.mybb.com/thread-241255.html) thread.

We have also published a [Quick Start](https://community.mybb.com/thread-241225.html) cheatsheet, allowing you to set up the development branch and preview it right away using your favorite workflow.

If you’re ready for some tinkering and a deeper dive, read [Experimenting with Inheritance Basics](https://community.mybb.com/thread-241300.html), where we make use of the new theming system and track how the application handles it so far.

## 10⁰ Familiar-looking Theme

When patrolling the Extend section, we noticed one submission was particularly reminiscent, but we couldn’t put our finger on it. A careful investigation that included, among other methods, reading its documentation revealed that it’s MyBB 1.9’s official theme — for MyBB 1.8.

The [Curves UI](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=view&pid=1594) takes the upcoming series’ look and backports it visually into the current stable version. It is also maintained on GitHub, where you can work with authors to improve it further.

It joins many responsive [Community-maintained themes](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=browse&category=themes), so it’s another good starting point for customization, and if you’re looking to prepare your forum for the style transition into 1.9.x, you can now use its latest build to make the eventual switch extra smooth.

## The Base

With the Community-driven environment giving the Project its *power*, the *base* of organizing work and tying up all loose ends is done by the MyBB Team.

To ensure this exponentiation yields the best product, we’ve recently brushed up and published the [list of Roles](https://mybb.com/about/team/roles/), including ten non[–](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako%3AeNqVlE2P2jAQhv-K5YruBaoE6HaVQ6XCUqmHVbeA2kPTwxAP4DaxU9tZESH--8Y2AZMVK60vieZ9Zub1555mkiFNaK-354KbhOxTQZpxY7ZY4E1CUroCjSnt-3hK_1fAFAgz3YIyKT1leLWUXJgl7swjMMbFxgKD-K4fMm0Fiy1lGZCfPvZfFJsD45W26shrh5MV5_EnKA6rHPVLL4oXoGrbZipzqSyQ0ndRFJ2mcwFOpGKoQhQAOmjrPf7K8_xIrddRtF7H8RV0GKBN79fQ0QVq615Fxx0Dr6CxXYEAv3NjPL7m92346G34-Cp-3N1UHA69Xiouz5nTDDc5kod6MiFLhILMpd124cXdAHZck0clM9SaDAaf7T-rMqM9UHtgqhAMl8IRC1RPPMO2RttzEJNZJnWtDRYdZUi-CYNKQE6-l6hcKd1hRrbzX8wMeQABm-aQCtNBxmSOGkFlW_Ke3OMT5rL0mAfPiQn5HX0YNTeDuM8fr__ClROGLn47bOMzxo1sLkTu1I4Y9HGyLxrImm-EU26Hl9ICs0pxU4diUFWW-tzvbHLx40vQ5xStylKq0MEpYbYzKLRd0bDReQJTWRSVaH20ubRPC1QFcNY8ZO4FOD4N_ogxUP_s6To0HFRGLmqR0cSoCvu0KhkYvOewUVDQZA25xsMzLOh9uw?type=png)management focus areas within the Team. Those now include separate teams for testing and developer relations, in adjustment according to the direction we’d like to take.

While those spots are often filled through invitation, if some of the listed activities pique your interest, [tell us about it](https://community.mybb.com/newthread.php?fid=135&threadprefix=45) (the worst you’ll get is a friendly nudge in the right direction on how to make a positive impact!).

# [Designing MyBB 1.9’s Installer](https://blog.mybb.com/2023/03/07/designing-mybb-1-9s-installer-2/)

Posted on [March 7, 2023](https://blog.mybb.com/2023/03/07/designing-mybb-1-9s-installer-2/ "3:32 pm")  by  [Devilshakerz](https://blog.mybb.com/author/devilshakerz/ "View all posts by Devilshakerz")

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8020837/218833490-8b837f35-8b0a-484d-906f-1743586b42c0.png)

One key to keeping software projects and the surrounding communities healthy is keeping *friction* for all audiences to a minimum.

In MyBB, this friction is derivative of *user experience* and *developer experience*. Our largest audience is formed by the end users — people browsing online forums, not expected to know what *MyBB* is, yet benefitting from fine-tuned visuals, phrases, and flows that come out-of-the-box. At the same time, we target two groups further down the forum assembly line, for whom both UX and DX apply.

For site owners and community leaders, the software needs to be approachable and intuitive — without requiring particular knowledge of languages and technologies — but also allow tweaking its look and functionality by maintainers with technical experience.

For developers, in addition to a useful extension system, APIs, and documentation, the software needs to expose the appropriate tools to allow speedy development and testing — without assuming one’s familiarity with it.

These factors are crucial in the world of free and open-source software, where the development relies on external contributors and their ease of work.

A **setup mechanism** is where their paths cross: it has to break down unavoidable complexity, without getting in expert users’ way. Besides having to meet best UX and DX practices, it also carries the weight of defining the first impression of the product for everyone.

## The Need for Speed

> *kawaii — 2:56 PM*
>
> *I wonder how many of the PostgreSQL installs are me with my Docker stack*

People who work with, and on MyBB, install it *a lot*. To comfortably test new code and eliminate bugs in the core and extensions, their setup should require minimal time and attention better spent on the task at hand.

The [existing](https://docs.mybb.com/1.8/install/) installation experience left much to be desired — among others, the old installer:

[![A screenshot of the Table Creation page displayed during the installation of MyBB 1.8, with an unnecessarily long list of names of created tables.](https://blog.mybb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mybb-18-install-tables-frame.png?w=684)](https://blog.mybb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mybb-18-install-tables-frame.png)

* + - * + - * is strictly synchronous and static, making users alternate between waiting and filling out forms,
