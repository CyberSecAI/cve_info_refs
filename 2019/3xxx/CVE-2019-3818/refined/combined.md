| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1668961#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-01-24 01:13:01 UTC  ``` The kube-rbac-proxy container as used in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not honour TLS configurations, allowing for use of insecure ciphers and TLS 1.0. An attacker could potentially target a weak TLS configuration via a man-in-the-middle attack to discover sensitive information.  The fix for this issue properly applies the configured TLS settings and makes TLS 1.2 the default.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1668961#c1)  Sam Fowler    2019-01-24 01:19:42 UTC  ``` Patch:  <https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy/pull/27/files>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1668961#c2)  Sam Fowler    2019-01-25 04:14:34 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Frederic Branczyk (Red Hat), Matthias Loibl (Red Hat), Max Inden (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1668961#c4)  Sam Fowler    2019-04-24 01:15:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHBA-2019:0327 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0327](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019%3A0327)   ``` |  |
