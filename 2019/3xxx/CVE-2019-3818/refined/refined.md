```
Root cause of vulnerability: The kube-rbac-proxy container, as used in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, does not honor TLS configurations.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper application of TLS configurations, allowing for the use of insecure ciphers and TLS 1.0.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker could target traffic sent over a TLS connection with a weak configuration and potentially break the encryption of the data stream, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information.

Attack vectors: Man-in-the-middle attack targeting a weak TLS configuration.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic.
