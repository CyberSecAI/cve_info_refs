Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3859:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unchecked use of the `_libssh2_packet_require` and `_libssh2_packet_requirev` functions within the libssh2 library. These functions don't properly validate the size of incoming data, which leads to out-of-bounds read issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The core weakness is the potential for reading memory beyond the allocated buffer due to the lack of size validation when using `_libssh2_packet_require` and `_libssh2_packet_requirev`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: An attacker could cause a crash by triggering the out-of-bounds read, thus denying service.
- Information Leak: Sensitive data stored in the client's memory could be read by the attacker, leading to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted SSH packets or SFTP packets from a compromised or malicious SSH server to a vulnerable client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Compromised SSH Server: The attacker must compromise or control an SSH server to send the specially crafted payloads to the vulnerable client.
- Network Position: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or send packets to the vulnerable client.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides within `_libssh2_packet_require` and `_libssh2_packet_requirev` functions, which are used during various SSH operations like key exchange, authentication, and channel setup.
- Attackers exploit this by sending incomplete or malformed packets, causing the library to read past the buffer boundaries when processing the packet.
- The issue was reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to libssh2 version 1.8.1 or later, which includes fixes for the vulnerabilities.
- Apply the patch provided by the libssh2 project and rebuild the library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered due to lack of proper size check prior to reading the packet buffer content.
- Many Linux distributions have released updates to address this vulnerability.
- There have been reports that the initial fix for CVE-2019-3859 broke public key authentication, requiring further updates and patches to correct this regression.
- The vulnerability affects versions 0.1 up to and including 1.8.0 of libssh2.
