                 CVE-2019-3863
Debian Bug     : 924965

Several vulnerabilities have recently been discovered in libssh2, a
client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol

CVE-2019-3855

    An integer overflow flaw which could have lead to an out of bounds
    write was discovered in libssh2 in the way packets were read from the
    server. A remote attacker who compromised an SSH server could have
    been able to execute code on the client system when a user connected
    to the server.

CVE-2019-3856

    An integer overflow flaw, which could have lead to an out of bounds
    write, was discovered in libssh2 in the way keyboard prompt requests
    were parsed. A remote attacker who compromised an SSH server could have
    been able to execute code on the client system when a user connected
    to the server.

CVE-2019-3857

    An integer overflow flaw which could have lead to an out of bounds
    write was discovered in libssh2 in the way SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
    packets with an exit signal were parsed. A remote attacker who
    compromises an SSH server could have been able to execute code on the
    client system when a user connected to the server.

CVE-2019-3858

    An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 when a specially
    crafted SFTP packet was received from the server. A remote attacker
    who compromised an SSH server could have been able to cause a Denial
    of Service or read data in the client memory.

CVE-2019-3859

    An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2's
    _libssh2_packet_require and _libssh2_packet_requirev functions. A
    remote attacker who compromised an SSH server could have be able to
    cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory.

CVE-2019-3860

    An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 in the way SFTP
    packets with empty payloads were parsed. A remote attacker who
    compromised an SSH server could have be able to cause a Denial of
    Service or read data in the client memory.

CVE-2019-3861

    An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 in the way SSH
    packets with a padding length value greater than the packet length
    were parsed. A remote attacker who compromised a SSH server could
    have been able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the
    client memory.

CVE-2019-3862

    An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 in the way
    SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packets with an exit status message and no
    payload were parsed. A remote attacker who compromised an SSH server
    could have been able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the
    client memory.

CVE-2019-3863

    A server could have sent multiple keyboard interactive response
    messages whose total length were greater than unsigned char max
    characters. This value was used as an index to copy memory causing
    an out of bounds memory write error.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.4.3-4.1+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.

 libssh2 Security Advisory: CVE-2019-3863
# Integer overflow in user authenticate keyboard interactive allows out-of-bounds writes

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3863.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A server could send a multiple keyboard interactive response messages whose
total length are greater than unsigned char max characters. This value is
used as an index to copy memory causing in an out of bounds memory write error.
(CWE-130).

There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3863 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: versions 0.1 up to and including 1.8.0
* Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

## THE SOLUTION

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the current memory index value plus the length of the
response message will fit into the memory buffer before copying the value and
incrementing the index value.

A patch for this problem is
[available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3863.patch)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

## TIME LINE

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

libssh2 1.8.1 was released on March 18 2019, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

#### Summary Security Advisory ID : BSA-2019-767 Component : LIBSSH2 Revision : 1.0: Final

libssh2 is a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol.  It supports regular terminal, SCP and SFTP sessions; port forwarding, X11 forwarding; password, key-based and keyboard-interactive authentication. Libssh2 releases security update for nine vulenrabilities on March 18, 2019.

**CVE-2019-3855**: Possible integer overflow in transport read that could lead to an out-of-bounds write. A malicious server, or a remote attacker who compromises an SSH server, could send a specially crafted packet which could result in executing malicious code on the client system when a user connects to the server**.**

**CVE-2019-3856:**Possible integer overflow in keyboard interactive handling allows out-of-bounds write. A malicious or a compromised SSH server can exploit client system by sending a value approaching unsigned int max number of keyboard prompt requests.

**CVE-2019-3857:**Possible integer overflow issue leads to zero-byte allocation and out-of-bounds write. A malicious server could send an SSH\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_REQUEST packet with an exit signal message with a length of max unsigned integer value.

**CVE-2019-3858:**Possible zero-byte allocation leading to an out-of-bounds. Attacking server can send a specially crafted partial SFTP packet with a zero value for the payload length, allowing attackers to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory.

**CVE-2019-3859:** Out-of-bounds reads with specially crafted payloads due to unchecked use of "\_libssh2\_packet\_require and \_libssh2\_packet\_requirev." A server could send a specially crafted partial packet in response to various commands such as: sha1 and sha226 key exchange, user auth list, user auth password response, allowing attackers to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory.

**CVE-2019-3860:**Out-of-bounds reads with specially crafted SFTP packets that also lead to Denial of Service or read data in the client memory attacks.

**CVE-2019-3861:** Out-of-bounds reads with specially crafted SSH packets that occurs when the padding length value is greater than the packet length, resulting in the parsing of the corrupted packet.

**CVE-2019-3862:**An out of bounds read issue occurs when the server sends specially crafted SSH\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_REQUEST packets with an exit status message and no payload, resulting in Denial of Service or read data in the client memory.

**CVE-2019-3863:**Integer overflow in the user authenticated keyboard interactive allows out-of-bounds writes.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found at: https://www.libssh2.org/security.html

**Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable**

No Brocade Fibre Channel technology products from Broadcom are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

 libssh2 Security Advisory: CVE-2019-3859

Out-of-bounds reads with specially crafted payloads due to unchecked use of

# `_libssh2_packet_require` and `_libssh2_packet_requirev`

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3859.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A server could send a specially crafted partial packet in response to various
commands such as: sha1 and sha226 key exchange, user auth list, user auth
password response, public key auth response, channel startup/open/forward/
setenv/request pty/x11 and session start up. The result would be a memory out
of bounds read (CWE-130).

There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3859 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: versions 0.1 up to and including 1.8.0
* Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

## THE SOLUTION

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the length of the payload is the required length before
reading the packet buffer content.

A patch for this problem is [available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3859.patch)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or greater

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

## TIME LINE

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

libssh2 1.8.1 was released on March 18 2019, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

## CREDITS

Reported by Chris Coulson of Canonical Ltd.

 libssh2 Security Advisory: CVE-2019-3860
# Out-of-bounds reads with specially crafted SFTP packets

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3860.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A server could send a specially crafted partial SFTP packet with a empty payload
in response to various SFTP commands such as read directory, file status,
status vfs and symlink. The result would be a memory out of bounds read
(CWE-130).

There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3860 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: versions 0.3 up to and including 1.8.0
* Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.9.0

## THE SOLUTION

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the length of the payload is the required length before
reading the packet buffer content.

A patch for this problem is [available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3860.patch)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

## TIME LINE

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

libssh2 1.8.1 was released on March 18 2019, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

## CREDITS

Reported by Chris Coulson of Canonical Ltd.

 libssh2 Security Advisory: CVE-2019-3857
# Possible integer overflow leading to zero-byte allocation and out-of-bounds write

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3857.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A server could send a `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST` packet with an exit signal
message with a length of max unsigned integer value. The length would then
have a value of 1 added to it and used to allocate memory causing a possible
memory write out of bounds error or zero byte allocation (CWE-130).

There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3857 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: versions 1.2.8 up to and including 1.8.0
* Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

## THE SOLUTION

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the length of the message plus 1 is less than `UINT_MAX`
before allocating memory using the computed value.

A patch for this problem is
[available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3857.patch)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

## TIME LINE

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

libssh2 1.8.1 was released on March 18, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

Package        : libssh2
Version        : 1.4.3-4.1+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-3859 CVE-2019-13115

Various security problems have been additionally fixed in libssh2, an SSH
client implementation written in C++.

CVE-2019-3859

    While investigating the impact of CVE-2019-13115 in Debian jessie's
    version of libssh2, it was discovered that issues around
    CVE-2019-3859 had not been fully resolved in Debian jessie's version
    of libssh2. A thorough manual (read, analyze, and copy code changes
    if needed) comparison of upstream code and code in Debian jessie's
    version of libssh2 was done and various more boundary checks and
    integer overflow protections got added to the package.

CVE-2019-13115

    Kevin Backhouse from semmle.com discovered that initial fixes for the
    CVE series CVE-2019-3855 - 2019-3863 introduced several regressions
    about signedness of length return values into the upstream code.
    While working on the CVE-2019-3859 update mentioned above, it was
    paid attention to not introduce these upstream regression registered
    as CVE-2019-13115.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.4.3-4.1+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

 libssh2 Security Advisory: CVE-2019-3862
# Out-of-bounds memory comparison

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3862.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A server could send a specially crafted `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST` packet with
an exit status message and no payload. This would result in an out of bounds
memory comparison (CWE-130).

There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3862 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: versions 0.11 up to and including 1.8.0
* Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

## THE SOLUTION

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the length of the packet is greater or equal to the value
being compared before calling memcmp().

A patch for this problem is [available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3862.patch)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

## TIME LINE

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

libssh2 1.8.1 was released on March 18 2019, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

## CREDITS

Reported by Chris Coulson of Canonical Ltd.

 libssh2 Security Advisory: CVE-2019-3861
# Out-of-bounds reads with specially crafted SSH packets

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3861.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A server could send a specially crafted SSH packet with a padding length value
greater than the packet length. This would result in a buffer read out of bounds
when decompressing the packet or result in a corrupted packet value (CWE-130).

There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3861 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: versions 0.15 up to and including 1.8.0
* Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

## THE SOLUTION

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the length of the packet padding is less than the packet
size minus 1.

A patch for this problem is [available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3861.patch)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

## TIME LINE

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

libssh2 1.8.1 was released on March 18 2019, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

## CREDITS

Reported by Chris Coulson of Canonical Ltd.

The result would be a memory out of  bounds read.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2019-03-12 09:15:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the libssh2 project Upstream: Chris Coulson (Canonical Ltd.)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-15 10:06:51 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/commit/dc109a7f518757741590bb993c0c8412928ccec2>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c7)  Doran Moppert    2019-03-19 04:41:31 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw was present in libssh2 packages included in Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor and Management Appliance, however libssh2 in these hosts is never exposed to malicious clients or servers.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c8)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-03-19 06:33:41 UTC  ``` Reference: <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/03/18/3>  Upstream Patch: <https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3859.patch>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c9)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-03-19 06:33:43 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3859.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c10)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-03-19 06:47:30 UTC  ``` Created libssh tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1690246](show_bug.cgi?id=1690246 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2019-3855 CVE-2019-3856 CVE-2019-3857 CVE-2019-3858 CVE-2019-3859 CVE-2019-3860 CVE-2019-3861 CVE-2019-3862 CVE-2019-3863 libssh: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-libssh2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1690247](show_bug.cgi?id=1690247 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-3855 CVE-2019-3856 CVE-2019-3857 CVE-2019-3858 CVE-2019-3859 CVE-2019-3860 CVE-2019-3861 CVE-2019-3862 CVE-2019-3863 mingw-libssh2: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c11)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-03-19 06:48:59 UTC  ``` Created mingw-libssh2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1690248](show_bug.cgi?id=1690248 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-3855 CVE-2019-3856 CVE-2019-3857 CVE-2019-3858 CVE-2019-3859 CVE-2019-3860 CVE-2019-3861 CVE-2019-3862 CVE-2019-3863 mingw-libssh2: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c12)  Kamil Dudka    2019-03-19 11:26:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Dhananjay Arunesh from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c8)) > Upstream Patch: > <https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3859.patch>  The current version of the patch (SHA1 a411eed4) triggers a severe regression so a follow-up fix is needed:  <https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/327>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1687307#c13)  Andrej Nemec    2019-03-19 12:28:42 UTC  ``` Created libssh2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1690408](show_bug.cgi?id=1690408 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3855 CVE-2019-3856 CVE-2019-3857 CVE-2019-3858 CVE-2019-3859 CVE-2019-3860 CVE-2019-3861 CVE-2019-3862 CVE-2019-3863 libssh2: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

Package        : libssh2
Version        : 1.4.3-4.1+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-3859

This regression update follows up on an upstream regression update [1]
regarding CVE-2019-3859.

With the previous libssh2 package revision, it was observed that user
authentication with private/public key pairs would fail under certain
circumstances.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1.4.3-4.1+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

 libssh2 Security Advisory: CVE-2019-3858
# Possible zero-byte allocation leading to an out-of-bounds read

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3858.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A server could send a specially crafted partial SFTP packet with a zero value
for the payload length. This zero value would be used to then allocate memory
resulting in a zero byte allocation and possible out of bounds read (CWE-130).

There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3858 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: versions 0.3 up to and including 1.8.0
* Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

## THE SOLUTION

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the length of the payload is not zero before allocing
the memory buffer using the value.

A patch for this problem is [available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3858.patch)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

## TIME LINE

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

libssh2 1.8.1 was released on March 18 2019, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

## CREDITS

Reported by Chris Coulson of Canonical Ltd.

 libssh2 Security Advisory: CVE-2019-3856
# Possible integer overflow in keyboard interactive handling allows out-of-bounds write

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3856.html)

## VULNERABILITY

A server could send a value approaching unsigned int max number of keyboard
prompt requests which could result in an unchecked integer overflow. The value
would then be used to allocate memory causing a possible memory write out of
bounds error (CWE-130).

There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

## INFO

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3856 to this issue.

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: all versions to and including 1.8.0
* Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

## THE SOLUTION

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures keyboard prompt requests value is less than 100 before
proceeding with the login process.

A patch for this problem is [available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3856.patch)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

## TIME LINE

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.

libssh2 1.8.1 was released on March 18 2019, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

## CREDITS

Reported by Chris Coulson of Canonical Ltd.
