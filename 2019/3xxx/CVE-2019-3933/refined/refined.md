The provided content relates to CVE-2019-3933.

Here's a summary of the relevant information:

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote View Login Bypass
*   **Affected Devices and Firmware:** Crestron AM-100 firmware 1.6.0.2 and Crestron AM-101 firmware 2.7.0.1.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists because an unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the remote view "login" simply by navigating to *http://[ip address]/images/browserslide.jpg*. The final image of a screenshare will also be cached at that location even after the presentation has finished.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can directly request the URL `http://[ip address]/images/browserslide.jpg` to view the slideshow.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can view locked presentations or become a presenter. If a presentation has not occurred since a reboot then this page will be a 404.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the Crestron device and requires no authentication.
