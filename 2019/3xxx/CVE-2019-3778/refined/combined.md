# CVE-2019-3778: Open Redirector in spring-security-oauth2

CRITICAL | FEBRUARY 21, 2019 | CVE-2019-3778
# Description

Spring Security OAuth, versions **2.3** prior to **2.3.5**, and **2.2** prior to **2.2.4**, and **2.1** prior to **2.1.4**, and **2.0** prior to **2.0.17**, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to an open redirector attack that can leak an authorization code. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify a manipulated redirection URI via the "redirect\_uri" parameter. This can cause the authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code.

This vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements:

* Act in the role of an Authorization Server (e.g. `@EnableAuthorizationServer`)
* Uses the `DefaultRedirectResolver` in the `AuthorizationEndpoint`

This vulnerability **does not** expose applications that:

* Act in the role of an Authorization Server and uses a different `RedirectResolver` implementation other than `DefaultRedirectResolver`
* Act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. `@EnableResourceServer`)
* Act in the role of a Client only (e.g. `@EnableOAuthClient`)

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Security OAuth **2.3** to **2.3.4**
* Spring Security OAuth **2.2** to **2.2.3**
* Spring Security OAuth **2.1** to **2.1.3**
* Spring Security OAuth **2.0** to **2.0.16**
* Older unsupported versions are also affected

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:

* **2.3.x** users should upgrade to **2.3.5**
* **2.2.x** users should upgrade to **2.2.4**
* **2.1.x** users should upgrade to **2.1.4**
* **2.0.x** users should upgrade to **2.0.17**
* Older versions should upgrade to a supported branch

There are no other mitigation steps necessary.

For users of **Spring Boot 1.5.x** and **Spring IO Platform Cairo**, it is highly recommended to override the spring-security-oauth version to the latest version containing the patch for the CVE. In order to override the version, you need to declare/set the property `spring-security-oauth.version`.

Below are instructions for users of **Spring Boot 1.5.x**.

To override a property using Maven, declare the property in your pom’s  section:

 `2.0.17.RELEASE`

To override a property using Gradle, configure the value in your `build.gradle` script:

`ext['spring-security-oauth.version'] = '2.0.17.RELEASE'`

Or in `gradle.properties`:

`spring-security-oauth.version=2.0.17.RELEASE`

**NOTE:** The same instructions apply for users of **Spring IO Platform Cairo**. However, the version to specify is **2.2.4.RELEASE**.
