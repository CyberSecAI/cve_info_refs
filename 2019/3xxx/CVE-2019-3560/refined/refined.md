Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improperly performed length calculation on a buffer within the `PlaintextRecordLayer` of the `fizz` library. Specifically, the code was performing an arithmetic operation on a `uint16_t` read from the wire, which could lead to an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Length Calculation:** The primary issue is the flawed calculation of the length of data, which could result in an infinite loop.
*   **Integer Overflow:**  The vulnerable code was susceptible to an integer overflow when processing the length field from the wire.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause an infinite loop within the `PlaintextRecordLayer`, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This means the affected system would become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by malicious user input that leads to the incorrect length calculation. Specifically, a crafted TLS record with a malformed length field is used to trigger the infinite loop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an application or service using the vulnerable version of the `fizz` library.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific byte sequence, particularly within a TLS record header, that will cause the flawed length calculation to occur.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of fizz prior to `v2019.03.04.00`.
*   The fix involves avoiding the arithmetic operation on the `uint16` read from the wire.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `PlaintextRecordLayer.cpp` file. The fix is implemented by modifying the `trimStart()` method, removing the vulnerable calculation.

**Relevant Code Changes (from commit 40bbb16):**
```cpp
// Before
length +=
sizeof(ContentType) + sizeof(ProtocolVersion) + sizeof(uint16_t);
buf.trimStart(length);

//After
buf.trimStart(static_cast<size_t>(kPlaintextHeaderSize) + length);
```
The fix uses the `kPlaintextHeaderSize` instead of calculating length based on the input, preventing the overflow.

**CWEs:**
* CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
* CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')
