CVE-2019-3688:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The /usr/sbin/pinger binary packaged with squid had incorrect permissions (squid:root, 0750).
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The binary was owned by squid user, allowing the compromised squid user to modify the pinger binary and gain persistence.
  - Impact of exploitation: A compromised squid user could gain persistence by changing the binary.
  - Attack vectors: Local access
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to have compromised a squid user.

CVE-2019-3690:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The chkstat tool followed symbolic links owned by regular users before adjusting permissions and ownership.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: chkstat did not properly validate symbolic links before operating on them, leading to a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.
  - Impact of exploitation: A compromised user could create a malicious symbolic link to escalate privileges to root when chkstat is run on the file/directory.
  - Attack vectors: Local access.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: A compromised user account that can write a file/directory used by chkstat is required.
