- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient parameter verification in some interfaces.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command execution vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Specific interfaces that do not adequately verify parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special privileges or user interaction is required (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N). The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
