{
  "CVE-2019-3838": {
    "description": "It was found that the forceput operator could be extracted from the DefineResource method. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER.",
    "vulnerability": "The `forceput` operator was accessible through the `DefineResource` method.",
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions and gain access to the file system outside of designated directories, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted PostScript file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PostScript file to be processed by a vulnerable Ghostscript instance.",
    "additional_details": [
        "The vulnerability involves the `.forceput` or `.forcedef` operator (depending on Ghostscript version) being accessible through the `DefineResource` method, even with the -dSAFER restriction.",
        "This flaw allows an attacker to have access to the file system outside of restricted directories, potentially enabling actions such as reading sensitive files or executing arbitrary code."
