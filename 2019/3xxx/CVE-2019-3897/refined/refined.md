Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `redhat-certification` tool. Specifically, it allows unauthorized users to download arbitrary files located within the `/var/www/rhcert` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal/Arbitrary File Download:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access controls, which allows any user to download any file within the `/var/www/rhcert` directory if they know the file's name. This is a form of a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information contained in files stored within the `/var/www/rhcert` directory. This could include configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data, leading to further compromise of the system or application.
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct File Request:** An attacker can directly request specific files by knowing their exact names within the `/var/www/rhcert` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the system running the vulnerable `redhat-certification` tool.
*   **Knowledge of Filenames:** The attacker needs knowledge of the file names present in the `/var/www/rhcert` directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report is closed with an errata.
*   The vulnerability is identified by CVE-2019-3897.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Riccardo Schirone from Red Hat Product Security.
