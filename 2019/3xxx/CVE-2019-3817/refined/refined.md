{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `comps_objmrtree_unite` function of the libcomps library.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability. When merging two `ObjMRTree` objects, the `pair` variable is freed and accessed again at the next iteration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who can make an application read a crafted comps XML file can crash the application or execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a malicious comps XML file to an application that uses libcomps library to parse it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted comps XML file and force an application that uses the affected `libcomps` library to read and parse this file."
