The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the waimaiCMS, which is based on ThinkPHP 3.1.3.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `ProductAction.class.php` file, specifically in the `index` function. User-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter from the URL, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `Food` model's where clause, due to the direct usage of the `id` parameter from the GET request (`I('id')`) without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of a successful attack is that an attacker could bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive data, such as user passwords. As demonstrated by the provided exploit, the attacker can extract the admin's password.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests, by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL. The attacker injects SQL code within the `id` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
