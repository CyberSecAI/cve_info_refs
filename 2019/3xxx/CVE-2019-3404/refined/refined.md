Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-3404 (explicitly mentioned)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper authentication in the router's app functionality. By adding special fields to the URI of the router app function, an attacker could bypass authentication and abuse background CGI functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication:**  The core issue is the lack of proper authentication checks when accessing certain router app functions via specific URIs.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers can access and abuse background CGI functions without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to user information.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers can cause the router to become unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated URIs:** The attack is carried out by crafting specific URIs with special fields that bypass authentication checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. The specific location of the attacker (local network vs. remote) is not explicitly stated, but the description suggests the attacker is in a position to interact with the router via HTTP.

**Affected Products and Versions**
- **Product:** 360 Router P0 and F5C
- **Version:** 360POP-F5C-V3.1.1.65150

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported by Wei Xie, Enze Wang, and Zhenhua Wang from NUDT.
- 360 has released a firmware update to address the issue. Users are advised to update their routers.
- 360 classified the vulnerability as a medium-risk.
- The specific details of the vulnerable URIs or CGI functions are not disclosed in this document, but the attack vector description suggests the attacker interacts with a router's web interface.
