Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `BrowseProjects.jspa` resource.
* **Weakness:**  The application fails to properly verify if a user is authorized to view archived project information before displaying it. This results in an Information Disclosure vulnerability.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can view information related to archived projects without having the necessary permissions, potentially exposing sensitive details.
* **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via the `BrowseProjects.jspa` resource. An attacker can access this resource to view archived projects details.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker is a remote user and does not require specific access level in the application. The attacker needs to be able to send a request to `BrowseProjects.jspa` to exploit the vulnerability.
