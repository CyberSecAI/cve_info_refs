CVE-2019-3687:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The 'easy' profile in the permission package specifies file capabilities and a permissive mode (0755) for /usr/bin/dumpcap, allowing any local user to execute dumpcap and read all network traffic.
  - Weakness: Insecure file permissions and capabilities for the dumpcap binary.
  - Impact of exploitation: Any local user can sniff network traffic.
  - Attack vector: Local access
  - Required attacker capabilities: Requires a system with wireshark installed. Any local user can exploit this.
