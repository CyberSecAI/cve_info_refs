- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of Range headers in HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly process overlapping range requests, leading to excessive memory consumption and potential denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can cause the application to crash, preventing users from accessing the system, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP requests with overlapping byte ranges in the Range header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service. Authentication is not required.
