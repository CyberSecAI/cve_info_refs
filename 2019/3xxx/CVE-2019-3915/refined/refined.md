Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3915:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The login process for the Verizon Fios Quantum Gateway (G1100) is vulnerable to replay attacks. The device does not enforce the use of HTTPS and transmits a salted SHA-512 password hash during login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Login Replay:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to intercept a valid login request and replay it to bypass authentication.
- **Lack of HTTPS enforcement:** The system does not enforce the use of HTTPS for login requests, making interception and replay feasible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the router's administrative web interface.
- This access would allow the attacker to make changes to the router's configuration, potentially leading to further compromise of the network and connected devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device. This means an attacker needs to be in a position to eavesdrop on network traffic.
- **Interception and Replay:**  The attacker intercepts a legitimate login request that includes the salted SHA-512 password hash. Then, they replay this captured request to authenticate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the local network where the Verizon Fios Quantum Gateway is located.
- They need the capability to capture network traffic (e.g., using tools like Wireshark).
- No prior authentication is needed; the attacker can intercept and replay a valid login request from another user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in firmware version 02.01.00.05 of the Verizon Fios Quantum Gateway (G1100).
- The fix for this issue is included in firmware version 02.02.00.13.
- The provided information is consistent with the information provided in the CVE description, with additional details on how the attack is carried out.
