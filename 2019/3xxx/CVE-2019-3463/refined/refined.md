{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of arguments passed to rsync.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of command-line arguments",
      "Bypassing restrictions imposed by rssh"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary shell commands.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted input to rsync through rssh"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An authenticated user with rsync access through rssh.",
     "details": "The vulnerability allows bypassing the restrictions imposed by rssh, which is intended to limit users to only rsync operations. By providing specific arguments to rsync, an attacker can bypass these restrictions and execute arbitrary shell commands. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the handling of the `--daemon` and `--config` command-line options and using `popt` to load a `~/.popt` configuration file"
