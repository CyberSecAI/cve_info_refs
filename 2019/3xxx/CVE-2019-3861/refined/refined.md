{
  "CVE-2019-3861": {
    "Description": "An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 in the way SSH packets with a padding length value greater than the packet length are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a denial of service or read data in the client memory.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the padding length value within an SSH packet. Specifically, the padding length can be greater than the actual packet length, leading to an out-of-bounds read during decompression.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to denial of service or disclosure of sensitive information due to the ability to read data from memory out-of-bounds.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious SSH server sends a specially crafted SSH packet with a padding length value greater than the actual packet length during the connection handshake.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to compromise the SSH server and manipulate the packets sent to the client."
