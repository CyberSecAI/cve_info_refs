Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3894:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ElytronManagedThread` in Wildfly's Elytron subsystem stores a `SecurityIdentity` for thread execution. Since these threads are reused and don't always terminate immediately, a shared thread could potentially execute with the wrong security identity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper management of `SecurityIdentity` in reusable threads.
- Thread reuse without clearing or resetting the associated security context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A thread could execute with the security identity of a previous operation.
- This could lead to a privilege escalation or access to unauthorized resources if the thread is used in a different context.
- Potential for data leaks or unauthorized modifications based on the wrong identity of the thread context.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker within the same JBoss instance or container.
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger operations that utilize the affected threads.
- The attack vector is the reuse of threads across different security contexts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code in the same process space as the vulnerable Wildfly instance.
- Ability to manipulate or initiate operations that utilize Elytron managed threads.
