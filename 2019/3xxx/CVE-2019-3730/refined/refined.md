    "description": "RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite versions before 4.1.6.3 (in 4.1.x) and before 4.4 (in 4.2.x, and 4.3.x), are vulnerable to an Information Exposure Through an Error Message vulnerability, also known as a \"padding oracle attack vulnerability\". A malicious remote user may potentially exploit this vulnerability to extract information leaving data at risk of exposure.",
