Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The YaST (Yet another Setup Tool) security module, when configuring user passwords, was falling back to using the insecure DES encryption algorithm if it couldn't find any configured settings.
- This fallback to DES was happening even when the system's `/etc/login.defs` configuration, which specifies the desired password hashing algorithm, was not being read correctly due to a bug where YaST was not checking the correct location for this configuration file (`/usr/etc/login.defs` instead of `/etc/login.defs`).
- This was introduced by a change in the location of the default `login.defs` file to `/usr/etc`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327):** The fallback to DES is the core vulnerability. DES is considered weak and easily crackable by modern standards.
- **Incorrect Configuration Reading:** YaST failed to properly read the system's security settings from the correct configuration file location leading to the fallback.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised User Passwords:** If a system used the vulnerable YaST configuration, newly created or changed user passwords would be hashed with the weak DES algorithm.
- **Increased Risk of Unauthorized Access:** DES hashed passwords are easy to crack, granting malicious actors the ability to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system and the ability to create or modify user accounts using YaST could potentially exploit this vulnerability by forcing the use of DES for password hashing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** Attackers need to have local access to the system to either create a new user or modify an existing user password via YaST.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** While not strictly required, the attacker would likely need to be aware of this specific vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by changing the default encryption method used by YaST to SHA512 and ensuring that YaST correctly reads the security settings from `/usr/etc/login.defs`.
- The issue was initially introduced in the openSUSE Factory distribution.
- There was an effort to notify affected users, including posting to the openSUSE subreddit and proposing a post-install message.
- The fix was implemented in `yast2-security` version `4.2.6`.
