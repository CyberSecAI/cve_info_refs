Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-3909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Premisys Identicard software (version 3.1.190) uses default credentials for its database.
- Users cannot change these credentials without the vendor's intervention.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Hardcoded/Default Credentials:** The software ships with a default database username ("PremisysUsr") and password ("ID3nt1card", or "ID3nt1cardID3nt1card" for domain policies requiring longer passwords).
- **Lack of User Control:** Users are unable to modify these default credentials through the software's interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker with knowledge of the default credentials can gain full access to the service databases.
- This allows them to:
    - Dump the contents of the database.
    - Modify the database contents.
    - Perform other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Network access to the database server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to have network access to the system where the Premisys Identicard database is running.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are needed, only the knowledge of the default credentials.
