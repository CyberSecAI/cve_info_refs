# Partial screen lock bypass via keybindings?

I noticed that on a locked Gnome screen, when you right-click on the password text
field, certain keyboard shortcuts are re-enabled.

Example1: right-click, the small menu (copy/paste/...) appears, then press Super+F10.
You can now see the front window menu, and eg you can close the window, or change its
parameters, etc.

Example2: right-click, press Alt+Screenshot, and a screenshot of the window is taken
and saved in the user's Pictures/ directory. It means that someone can fill the disk
with images.

Example3: press Alt+Super+S, and sometimes, Orca starts spelling you the content of
the window (which is supposed to be secret since the screen is locked). It does not
always do, not sure why. Note also that by then enabling the virtual keyboard (by
clicking on it in the accessibility button that appeared on the upper-right corner
of the screen), you can then open (in the session, but not in gdm) the accessibility
menu.

All of that doesn't look really intentional to me.
