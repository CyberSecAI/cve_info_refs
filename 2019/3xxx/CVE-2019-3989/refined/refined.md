Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-3989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improperly sanitized input within the `get_networks()` function located in `/root/apps/auth_gen/auth_gen`. This function retrieves external output, which is then directly passed to `os.execute()` without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is a command injection vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization before using `os.execute()`. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by injecting malicious input into the external output processed by the vulnerable function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command execution on the Blink XT2 Sync Module.
- **Root Access:** The commands are executed as the root user, giving an attacker full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Hijacking:** The attack vector involves hijacking DNS traffic from the sync module or camera. This allows an attacker to manipulate the external output received by the `get_networks()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate DNS traffic from the Blink XT2 Sync Module.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attack requires a man-in-the-middle position to hijack the DNS traffic.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable code is located within `/root/apps/auth_gen/auth_gen`.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to update the firmware to version 2.13.11 or later.

This vulnerability is also part of a larger set of vulnerabilities in the Blink XT2 Sync Module.
