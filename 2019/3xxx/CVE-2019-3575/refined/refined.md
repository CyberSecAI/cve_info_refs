**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sqla_yaml_fixtures.load` method is vulnerable due to insecure deserialization of YAML data. Specifically, it allows the use of `!!python/object/apply` which can be abused to execute arbitrary Python code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure deserialization of YAML data.
- Use of `!!python/object/apply` tag, allowing arbitrary Python code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the system where the vulnerable code is running.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Providing specially crafted YAML input to the `sqla_yaml_fixtures.load` method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the YAML data that is being processed by the vulnerable `sqla_yaml_fixtures.load` method.
