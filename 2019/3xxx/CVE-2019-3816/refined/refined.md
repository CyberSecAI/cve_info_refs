Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-3816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `openwsmand` daemon, in versions up to and including 2.6.9, has a vulnerability where its working directory was set to the root directory (`/`). This allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to disclose arbitrary files outside of the registered URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Due to the root working directory, an attacker can access any file on the system via specially crafted HTTP requests by specifying the full path, or relative path with `../`, of the target file.
- **Missing Input Validation:** The `openwsman` daemon lacks proper input validation, allowing for directory traversal using relative paths, specifically with ".." sequences. While a function named `remove_double_dots` exists, it does not account for leading dots ("./etc/passwd") allowing for path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, password hashes, and other confidential data.
- **Potential System Compromise:** Depending on the content of the disclosed files, this could be further leveraged to escalate privileges or gain a foothold in the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network connections, allowing a remote attacker to initiate the attack.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning any attacker with network access to the service can leverage it.
- **HTTP Request:** A specially crafted HTTP request is required, specifying the target file to be disclosed. This can be done via GET or POST requests.
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use relative path sequences (e.g., `../`) or explicit absolute paths (e.g. `/etc/shadow`) to access files outside the intended scope.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system where the vulnerable `openwsman` daemon is running.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **HTTP Request Creation:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests with specific path sequences.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

- Patches and fixes have been released by multiple vendors, including Fedora, Red Hat, and openSUSE.
- The patches involve:
    - Renaming function `remove_double_dots` to `remove_all_leading_dots`
    - Changing the working directory from `/` to the service path
    - Filtering requests based on the service path and allowed URIs.
- There is also a related vulnerability (CVE-2019-3833) that allows for a denial of service by causing an infinite loop with a crafted request.
