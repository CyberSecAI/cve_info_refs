Better handling of truncated data when reading strings

Summary:
Currently we read string size and blindly pre-allocate it. This allows malicious attacker to send a few bytes message and cause server to allocate huge amount of memory (>1GB).

This diff changes the logic to check if we have enough data in the buffer before allocating the string.

This is a second part of a fix for [CVE-2019-3553](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-859v-9mcv-7rw3 "CVE-2019-3553").

## Description

C++ Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages declaring containers of sizes larger than the payload. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages which would result in a large memory allocation, potentially leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2020.02.03.00.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Better handling of truncated data when reading containers

```
Summary:
Currently we read the container size and blindly pre-allocate the container of that size. This allows malicious attacker to send few bytes message and cause server to allocate GBs of memory.

This diff changes the logic to check if we have at least 1b/element in our buffer, thus forcing attacker to send that much data.

This is a partial fix for [CVE-2019-3553](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-859v-9mcv-7rw3 "CVE-2019-3553").

# CVE-2019-3553

**Description:** C++ Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages declaring containers of sizes larger than the payload. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages which would result in a large memory allocation, potentially leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2020.02.03.00. **Affected Versions:** This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2020.02.03.00. **References:**
