Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-3553

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way C++ Facebook Thrift servers handled messages declaring containers (lists, sets, maps) with sizes larger than the actual payload.
*   The server would blindly pre-allocate memory based on the declared size without checking if sufficient data was present in the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The server did not validate if the incoming message had sufficient bytes to accommodate the declared container size.
*   **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The server pre-allocated memory based on the attacker-controlled size, potentially leading to excessive allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious client could send a short message with a large declared container size. This would cause the server to allocate a huge amount of memory, potentially exhausting resources and leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network traffic.
*   **Malicious Client:** An attacker can create a malicious client that crafts specific messages to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to communicate with the vulnerable server.
*   **Message Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft messages with specific size declarations for containers.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Facebook Thrift servers prior to v2020.02.03.00.
*   The provided content includes two commits that address the vulnerability:
    *   **Commit `3f156207e8a6583d88999487e954320dc18955e6`**: This commit implemented a check to ensure that there is at least one byte of data available per element declared in a container before proceeding with reading the container. This prevents the server from pre-allocating massive amounts of memory without receiving the corresponding data.
    *   **Commit `c9a903e5902834e95bbd4ab0e9fa53ba0189f351`**: This commit implemented a check to ensure there is enough data available before reading a string.
*   The fix involved adding checks within the `BinaryProtocolReader` and `CompactProtocolReader` classes to ensure enough data is available before pre-allocating the string or container and also introduced a new method `canReadNElements` to check if enough bytes exist in the buffer before allocating memory for containers.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a High Severity issue with a CVSS score of 7.5.
*   The CWE associated with the vulnerability is CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits.
