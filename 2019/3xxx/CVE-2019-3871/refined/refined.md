Based on the provided content, here's a summary of the CVE-2019-3871 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied data when building an HTTP request from a DNS query within the HTTP Connector of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server's Remote backend.
*   **Root Cause:** The PowerDNS Authoritative Server, when using the HTTP remote backend in RESTful mode (without post=1 set), doesn't properly validate data from a DNS query when constructing the HTTP request.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a crafted DNS query to the PowerDNS Authoritative Server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The server can be made to connect to an invalid endpoint, preventing the remote backend from getting a response.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The server could connect to an internal endpoint, potentially allowing an attacker to extract meaningful information about the response, if the Authoritative Server has access to internal servers.
    *   **Content Spoofing:** By timing the crafted query, an attacker can potentially control the HTTP server used for subsequent queries.
*   **Affected Versions:** PowerDNS Authoritative Server up to and including 4.1.6.
*   **Fixed Versions:** 4.1.7 and 4.0.7.
*   **Severity:** High.
*   **Exploit:** Triggered via crafted queries.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Remote attacker.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to a non-affected version (4.1.7, 4.0.7 or later).

The vulnerability exists in the HTTP remote backend when used in RESTful mode (without post=1 set). It allows a remote attacker to force the PowerDNS server to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server.
