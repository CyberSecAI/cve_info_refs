Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-3824:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   All provided content directly relates to **CVE-2019-3824**. The vulnerability is consistently described as an out-of-bounds read in the `ldb_wildcard_compare()` function of the `ldb` library, impacting Samba AD DC setups when using a specific LDAP search filter.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the `ldb_wildcard_compare()` function of the `ldb` library.
*   This function is used during LDAP searches involving wildcards, specifically when processing search expressions with multiple wildcard characters.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core weakness is that `ldb_wildcard_compare()` can attempt to read memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a denial-of-service (DoS). A crafted LDAP search expression can trigger the out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash of the shared LDAP server process in Samba AD DC.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **LDAP Search Expressions:** The vulnerability is triggered using specially crafted LDAP search expressions that include wildcard characters in a specific pattern. An example provided is:  `cn=test*multi*test*multi`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with read permissions on the LDAP server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to send the crafted LDAP search expression to the vulnerable server over the network.
*   **Specific Samba Configuration:**
    *   The vulnerability primarily affects Samba AD DC setups.
    *  For Samba versions 4.7 and later, the vulnerable code is only used when Samba is specifically run with the `-M prefork` or `-M single` command-line options for the `samba` process.
    *   By default, Samba 4.7 and later do not use the shared LDAP process model, making the default configuration less susceptible.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the  `ldb_wildcard_compare()` function handles wildcard comparisons. An attacker can manipulate the search expression to cause the function to read beyond the bounds of a memory buffer.

*   The vulnerability affects `ldb` versions shipped with older Samba versions and other software that utilizes the `ldb` library.

*   Patches have been created to fix the vulnerability. These patches focus on correcting the length handling to prevent out-of-bounds access and include additional checks in order to prevent crashes.

*   The vulnerability is considered to be of moderate severity and can be exploited by an authenticated user, with low privileges, via network access, and without requiring user interaction.

**Summary of Information From Different Sources:**

*   **Debian:**  Debian Security Advisory DSA-4397-1 and DLA 1699-1 highlights the out-of-bounds read in `ldb_wildcard_compare()` and its denial-of-service impact.
*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 1671845 notes that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are not affected because they do not use Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller. However, Fedora is affected. They state that Samba 4.10 contains the fix.
*   **SUSE:** SUSE Bugzilla Bug 1125410 details the vulnerability in ldb, its impact as a denial of service, and the fix which is included in ldb-1.2.3-3.8.1 and samba 4.10.5.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu Security Notice USN-3895-1 describes the issue in their ldb package and provides updated packages for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, 16.04 ESM, 18.04 ESM, and 18.10.
*   **NetApp:** NetApp Security Advisory NTAP-20190226-0001 explains the impact of the vulnerability and states that this vulnerability does not affect NetApp products other than *StorageGRID* and *StorageGRID Webscale*. They also provide the CVSS score.
*   **Samba:** The Samba Bugzilla entry confirms the root cause of the vulnerability and tracks the patches.

In summary, CVE-2019-3824 represents a denial-of-service vulnerability that can be triggered by a low-privileged authenticated attacker manipulating an LDAP search expression with specific patterns of wildcards, especially when the affected Samba AD DC is run using the `-M prefork` or `-M single` command-line option. The vulnerability exists in the `ldb_wildcard_compare()` function which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, causing a crash of the LDAP server. The vulnerability is fixed in newer versions of `ldb` and `samba`.
