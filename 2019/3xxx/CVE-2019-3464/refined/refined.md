Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-3464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of environment variables when the `rssh` restricted shell executes `rsync`. Specifically, the `HOME` environment variable is not unset, allowing `rsync` to load a user-controlled `~/.popt` configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Environment Variable Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious configurations via the `HOME` environment variable.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution via popt:** The `rsync` program, when built with `popt` (a command-line option parsing library), can execute arbitrary commands defined in a `~/.popt` configuration file. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the intended restrictions of `rssh`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the target server. This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **rsync Command:** The vulnerability is triggered during the execution of `rsync` through the `rssh` restricted shell.
- **Environment Manipulation:** The attacker must control the `HOME` environment variable which will point to the location of a crafted `.popt` file.
- **Malicious .popt Configuration:** The attacker must create a malicious `.popt` file, and this file will be used by rsync with the vulnerable popt library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a restricted shell configured to use rssh.
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to modify and control where the `HOME` directory points to, and create malicious files.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is specifically related to `rsync` when built with `popt`.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing `popt` from loading a user-controlled configuration file by unsetting the `HOME` variable.
- The vulnerability also allows redefining command-line options to bypass argument checking.
- Patches for this vulnerability address this issue by rejecting `--daemon` and `--config` command line options, unsetting the `HOME` variable, and ensuring that `--` is not treated as a stop token for options.
