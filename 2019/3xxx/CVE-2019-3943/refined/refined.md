Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-3943:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An authenticated directory traversal vulnerability exists in the *fileman* binary (SYS\_TO number: 72) of MikroTik RouterOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authenticated Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended sandbox path, which is `/rw/disk`.
- **Insecure File Access:** This traversal permits the attacker to perform *mkdir*, *read*, and *write* operations on files located outside the sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read any file on the filesystem.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can write to any location on the filesystem that is not marked as read-only.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to write files could potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution by placing malicious code into system directories or configuration files.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the affected RouterOS device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **HTTP or Winbox (8291):** The vulnerability can be reached over HTTP and Winbox protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate to the RouterOS device.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the RouterOS device.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2018-14847, but this one exists in the *fileman* binary and requires authentication.
- A proof of concept was created to demonstrate the vulnerability by creating a simple webpage.
- The vulnerability affects multiple release channels of RouterOS.
- The vendor, MikroTik, released a fix in RouterOS version 6.44RC1 and later.

**Affected Products:**

- RouterOS Stable 6.43.12 and below
- RouterOS Long-term 6.42.12 and below
- RouterOS Testing 6.44beta75 and below
