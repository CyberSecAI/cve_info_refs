Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `vdsm` (Virtual Desktop Server Manager) service, versions 4.19 through 4.30.3 and 4.30.5 through 4.30.8, exposed a `systemd_run()` function to the `vdsm` system user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Privilege escalation vulnerability. The exposed `systemd_run()` function, intended for systemd interaction, could be abused by the `vdsm` system user to execute arbitrary commands as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A compromise of services running under the `vdsm` account could lead to a complete root compromise of the system. This breaks the defense-in-depth strategy of having a non-root `vdsm` system account, leading to full system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation is through the exposed `systemd_run()` function accessible to the `vdsm` system user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must first compromise a service running under the `vdsm` system account.
- Then, the attacker can leverage the exposed `systemd_run()` function to execute arbitrary commands as root.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced, removed, and then re-introduced due to changes to how systemd utilities were handled within the `vdsm` service.
- A fix was implemented by removing the exposed `systemd_run()` function.
- The issue was addressed in Red Hat Virtualization 4 via errata RHSA-2019:0457 and RHSA-2019:0458.
