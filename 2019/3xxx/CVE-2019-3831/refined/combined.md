| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1677108#c0)  Doran Moppert    2019-02-14 04:05:51 UTC  ``` vdsm v4.19 through v4.30.3 and v4.30.5 through v4.30.8 exposed a systemd_run() function to the vdsm system user, which could be abused to run arbitrary commands as root. This breaks the defense-in-depth of having a non-root vdsm system account. While not exploitable by attackers under normal circumstances, this flaw could lead to a compromise of services running under the vdsm account being escalated to a full root compromise.  Upstream fix:  <https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/97659/>  Originally introduced by:  commit e56541ccb372e106eeb4fc3f7afc575f8dd32de2 Author: Francesco Romani <fromani> Date:   Fri Apr 22 10:15:54 2016 +0200      supervdsm: expose systemd utilities                               Removed by:  commit f85f0527f1421618714e89eee03ee2f0400a65ae Author: Francesco Romani <fromani> Date:   Thu Nov 22 13:44:25 2018 +0100      supervdsm: systemd: remove support  Re-introduced by:  commit daf5b3c3aaa3796b8f9be22fe2059f6f6152a3ce Author: Nir Soffer <nsoffer> Date:   Sun Dec 9 16:53:28 2018 +0200      supervdsm: Add back systemd support   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1677108#c1)  Doran Moppert    2019-02-14 04:06:05 UTC  ``` Created vdsm tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1677109](show_bug.cgi?id=1677109 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-3831 vdsm: privilege escalation to root via systemd_run [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1677108#c5)  Nir Soffer    2019-02-16 21:54:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Doran Moppert from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1677108#c0))  Removed again by:  commit f6de9ce61380bbad5c98e7f2e8b26b9de74cf9b5 Author: Nir Soffer <nsoffer> Date:   Fri Feb 8 17:53:00 2019 +0200      systemd: Remove systemd_run() supervdsm service   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1677108#c6)  Nir Soffer    2019-02-16 21:57:08 UTC  ``` For 4.2, we have this fix: <https://gerrit.ovirt.org/c/97737/>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1677108#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-03-05 11:09:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0457 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0457](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0457)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1677108#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-03-05 11:09:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0458 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0458](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0458)   ``` |  |
