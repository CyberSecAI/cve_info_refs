| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c0)  Karol Babioch   2018-10-23 15:56:10 UTC  ``` "User" module leaks any data which is passed on as a parameter to ssh-keygen. This could lean in undesirable situations such as passphrases credentials passed as a parameter for the ssh-keygen executable. Showing those credentials in clear text form for every user which have access just to the process list.

It looks like RH just patched versions 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c3)  Joseph Davis   2018-11-09 18:25:16 UTC  ``` Also Ansible upstream only patched the 2.x versions. <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/47436> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c4)  Fergal Mc Carthy   2018-11-09 18:50:14 UTC  ``` Looks like RH only patched the "active" ansible versions, e.g. current, and 2 previous versions...  Looking at the user module implementation in ansible 1.9.6 I see the following:          cmd.append('-N')         if self.ssh_passphrase is not None:             cmd.append(self.ssh_passphrase)         else:             cmd.append('')  That suggests we have the issue in ansible 1.9.6, and would need to backport the proposed fix to our ansible1 RPM that is used in the SOC/CLM product line. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c5)  Joseph Davis   2018-11-09 20:21:01 UTC  ``` Fergal and I checked our Ansible playbooks and find no uses of the 'ssh_key_passphrase' property (the ssh keys are managed a different way).  Thus for Cloud products the bug is already mitigated.  We can create a patch for the ansible1 project in IBS/OBS to backport the fix, but there isn't any urgency at this time. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-04-03 07:10:47 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2019:1125-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

## Topic

An update for ansible is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14.0 (Rocky).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c0)  Stephan Schöttl   2018-09-27 07:36:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 784433](attachment.cgi?id=784433 "Example ansible playbook to reproduce the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=784433&action=edit "Example ansible playbook to reproduce the issue") Example ansible playbook to reproduce the issue  The firewalld module of ansible fails with "An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: NameError: global name 'fw_offline' is not defined". The patch from  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/38161> (backport for ansible 2.5) is not sufficient. From my first analysis /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/system/firewalld.py tries "import firewall.config" which fails because firewall.config is only available for python3 (at least I cannot find it). I am attaching a simple example to reproduce (ansible-playbook firewall.yml).  rpm -q ansible ansible-2.5.1-lp150.1.1.noarch  cat /etc/os-release  NAME="openSUSE Leap" VERSION="15.0" ID="opensuse-leap" ID_LIKE="suse opensuse" VERSION_ID="15.0" PRETTY_NAME="openSUSE Leap 15.0" ANSI_COLOR="0;32" CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:opensuse:leap:15.0" BUG_REPORT_URL="<https://bugs.opensuse.org>" HOME_URL="<https://www.opensuse.org/>" ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c1)  Lars Vogdt   2019-03-15 18:37:18 UTC  ``` Looks to me like the issue if fixed in latest ansible 2.7.8 (if you want, try the package from the development repository in systemsmanagement).  @Maintenance: as there are a lot of other fixes included in the latest version, I like to release the 2.7.8 one as maintenance update for  * openSUSE:Backports:SLE-12/ansible * openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15:Update/ansible * openSUSE:Leap:15.0:Update/ansible * openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update/ansible * openSUSE:Leap:42.3:Update/ansible if you agree.  There are some configuration settings, that are meanwhile marked as "deprecated" and this will result in a warning message once the user executes his ansible playbooks, but I assume that at least the following CVE (and other) fixes are worth this small inconvenience: * CVE-2018-16876 * CVE-2018-16859 * CVE-2018-10875 * CVE-2018-10855 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2019-03-16 07:02:00 UTC  ``` would be fine for me. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c3)  Lars Vogdt   2019-03-16 22:28:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c2)) > would be fine for me.  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/685668> created.  @Maintenance: sorry to disturb, but it's unclear to me when to mark a bug as fixed?

files
Update to version 2.8.0
Major changes:
\* Experimental support for Ansible Collections and content namespacing -
Ansible content can now be packaged in a collection and addressed via
namespaces. This allows for easier sharing, distribution, and
installation
of bundled modules/roles/plugins, and consistent rules for accessing
specific content via namespaces.
\* Python interpreter discovery - The first time a Python module runs on
a target, Ansible will attempt to discover the proper default Python
interpreter to use for the target platform/version (instead of
immediately defaulting to /usr/bin/python). You can override this
behavior by setting ansible\_python\_interpreter or via config. (see
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50163>)
\* become - The deprecated CLI arguments for --sudo, --sudo-user,
--ask-sudo-pass, -su, --su-user, and --ask-su-pass have been removed,
in favor of the more generic --become, --become-user,
--become-method, and
--ask-become-pass.
\* become - become functionality has been migrated to a plugin
architecture, to allow customization of become functionality and 3rd
party become methods (<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50991>)
- addresses CVE-2018-16859, CVE-2018-16876, CVE-2019-3828, CVE-2018-16837

Update to version 2.8.0
Major changes:
\* Experimental support for Ansible Collections and content namespacing -
Ansible content can now be packaged in a collection and addressed via
namespaces. This allows for easier sharing, distribution, and
installation
of bundled modules/roles/plugins, and consistent rules for accessing
specific content via namespaces.
\* Python interpreter discovery - The first time a Python module runs on
a target, Ansible will attempt to discover the proper default Python
interpreter to use for the target platform/version (instead of
immediately defaulting to /usr/bin/python). You can override this
behavior by setting ansible\_python\_interpreter or via config. (see
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50163>)
\* become - The deprecated CLI arguments for --sudo, --sudo-user,
--ask-sudo-pass, -su, --su-user, and --ask-su-pass have been removed,
in favor of the more generic --become, --become-user,
--become-method, and
--ask-become-pass.
\* become - become functionality has been migrated to a plugin
architecture, to allow customization of become functionality and 3rd
party become methods (<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50991>)
- addresses CVE-2018-16859, CVE-2018-16876, CVE-2019-3828, CVE-2018-16837

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A3789)

## Topic

An update for ansible is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote-task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

Security Fix(es):

* Ansible: path traversal in the fetch module (CVE-2019-3828)
* ansible: unsafe template evaluation of returned module data can lead to information disclosure (CVE-2019-10156)
* Ansible: disclosure data when prompted for password and template characters are passed (CVE-2019-10206)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# USN-4072-1: Ansible vulnerabilities

24 July 2019

Several security issues were fixed in Ansible.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [ansible](/security/cves?package=ansible) - Configuration management, deployment, and task execution system

## Details

It was discovered that Ansible failed to properly handle sensitive information.

A local attacker could use those vulnerabilities to extract them.

I'm looking at the code for the fork of Ansible 1.9 we use in SUSE OpenStack Cloud 8 CLM.  As Dirk mentioned, there is similar code that could also log the output, though there are many differences between the 1.9 and 2.4.6 versions.  Was there another reason for your statement that "older ones" are not affected that I might be missing? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1118896#c8)  Joseph Davis   2019-01-03 05:21:50 UTC  ``` Note: one of the things refactored was the ssh.py location 1.9 ardana-ansible: connection_plugins/ssh.py 2.6.4 upstream ansible: lib/ansible/plugins/connection/ssh.py  Unfortunately, the refactoring is so different that in 1.9 there isn't a self._play_context.no_log variable to reference for the message logic. I'll have to dig a bit more to determine if there is a direct analog. Or if the change is needed in the old version - the problem only would arise if someone was running a playbook with the -vvv command and was capturing the logs in a place they would access them, and on a cloud system they would have to have direct login access to the system to accomplish that. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1118896#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-04-03 07:11:04 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2019:1125-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

##### SUMMARY

become\_plugins using the CLIARGS context so we don't have to pass options around everywhere

##### ISSUE TYPE

* Feature Pull Request

##### COMPONENT NAME

become plugins

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The main thing yet to do is to get rid of `play.Play._set_from_CLI_options` and `base.FieldAttributeBase._set_options`. Those should be implemented via `FieldAttribute` defaults instead.

This is built on top of [#50069](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50069) which should be merged first.

Sorry, something went wrong.

a few minor things around dep warnings for the remaining play\_context attrs (yeah, right, we'll go back and add dep warnings in the next release ;) ), otherwise LGTM

Having these hard-fail on missing based on current CLI impls doesn't seem right; should probably all use `.get()` (until they're properly segmented off in plugins)

Do we know what's still setting these? The `or`s in the plugin option setup code below are a little concerning... If we're keeping them around for backcompat with external callers, all the stuff that's flagged as "deprecated" here should be issuing dep warnings on use, otherwise we should just nuke it all now.

From what I know, there was some code out there directly interacting with PlayContext. And based on other deprecations, we've decided largely not to deprecate in the same release as the "replacement" was implemented.

Yeah, this seems like one of those unrelated changes, that shouldn't necessarily go here. I'll have to verify if it breaks become plugins by reverting this change for now.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

I'm also wondering about:   "Could not chdir to home directory /home/william: No such file or directory" This looks to me like there is no directory for the user that logs in to the host - and therefor ansible could not create the temp directory and files that it needs to create.
