{
  "CVE-2019-3828": {
    "description": "Ansible fetch module before versions 2.5.15, 2.6.14, 2.7.8 has a path traversal vulnerability which allows copying and overwriting files outside of the specified destination in the local ansible controller host, by not restricting an absolute path.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Ansible fetch module doesn't restrict absolute paths, allowing path traversal.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary files on the Ansible controller host can be overwritten or copied, leading to potential data confidentiality and integrity issues.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can craft an Ansible playbook with a fetch task that uses an absolute path for the destination.",
         "The vulnerability can be exploited when an Ansible playbook is run and a path traversal is introduced into the destination parameter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must have the ability to create and execute ansible playbooks, and control the values passed into the fetch module. They must be able to modify the destination path of the fetch module."
