Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `%post` script of the `pcp.spec` file. Specifically, the script executes `source "$PCP_LOG_DIR/configs.sh"`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled `source` execution: The script blindly sources the `configs.sh` file located in the `$PCP_LOG_DIR` (which defaults to `/var/log/pcp`).
- User-controlled file: The `pcp` user has write access to the `/var/log/pcp` directory and can create or modify the `configs.sh` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local Privilege Escalation (LPE): By writing malicious commands into `/var/log/pcp/configs.sh`, a `pcp` user can execute arbitrary code with root privileges when the `pcp` package is installed or reinstalled (via `zypper in -f pcp`).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be able to log in as the `pcp` user.
- The attacker needs to write malicious code into the `configs.sh` file under the `/var/log/pcp` directory before a `zypper in -f pcp` command is run by root

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to log in as a `pcp` user.
- The attacker must have write access to the `/var/log/pcp` directory to modify/create the `configs.sh` file.

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability allows a local, low-privileged user (`pcp`) to gain root privileges by injecting malicious code into a script that is executed by the `pcp` package post-installation process with root privileges. This is due to the insecure usage of `source` command within the `pcp` package's `%post` installation script, which allows any user able to write to the `/var/log/pcp/configs.sh` file to execute code as root.
