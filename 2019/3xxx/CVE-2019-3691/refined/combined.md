Would a test for the file not being a symbolic link be sufficient? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-25 10:53:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Egbert Eich from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c1)) For the chown -R there's no easy way to fix it. I've been looking for supporting tools that could be used here, but without success so far. But since that requires fs.protected_hardlinks=0 (and we have it enabled by default) this is low priority ATM.   For the munge.key issue: You could use runuser to create the file as the munge user. If you set the umask correctly you can remove the chown and chmod. It also prevents the attacker from racing with the if/dd construct and use it to overwrite arbitrary files ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2019-10-25 10:55:33 UTC  ``` We'll track this via CVE-2019-3691. Can be made public as soon as we release an update ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c4)  Egbert Eich   2019-10-25 11:56:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c2)) > (In reply to Egbert Eich from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c1)) > For the chown -R there's no easy way to fix it.

This cannot be handled by a mask. Looking at chown, if the only concern is the fact that it is a link, we can use chown -h to avoid that we follow the link. The only consequence would be that if the file existed and belonged to the attacker it no longer does - even if the file was set suid before, and the attacker would manage to execute it before the chown happens, the damage would be contained: the munge user/group cannot really do much. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c5)  Egbert Eich   2019-10-25 11:57:59 UTC  ``` Actually, set NEEDINFO again - see previous comment. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c6)  Egbert Eich   2019-10-25 18:19:15 UTC  ``` Is this better?  %define fixperm() [ -e %1 ] && /bin/chown -h %munge_u:%munge_g %1 [...] unset tmpfile if [ ! -e %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key ]; then   if [ -a -c /dev/urandom ]; then       tmpfile=$(mktemp /tmp/tmpfile-XXXXXXX)       /bin/dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=1024 > $tmpfile 2>/dev/null   fi elif [ $(/usr/bin/stat -c %U:%G:%a %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key) != \     %munge_u:%munge_g:400 ]; then     tmpfile=$(/usr/bin/mktemp /tmp/tmpfile-XXXXXXX)     /usr/bin/cat %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key > $tmpfile fi if [ -n "$tmpfile" ]; then     /bin/chmod 0400 $tmpfile     /bin/chown -h %munge_u:%munge_g $tmpfile     /bin/mv $tmpfile %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key fi ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c7)  Egbert Eich   2019-11-04 11:33:06 UTC  ``` Further notes: Here chown/chmod are not used recursively. - To prevent chown from following links, one can use the -h option.   This will mitigate your exploit example. - umask is not really feasible as we also may have to fix up old   ownerships - the munge user is separate and has no root rights.  Create files in these locations requires much more rights than one would be able to gain from becoming the munge user. In your exploit example, one was the munge user already. 'Games' creating a suid file and having the installation chown it to another user will not allow an exploit either: chown will reset the suid bit.  So I believe, the proposed change addresses possible security concerns. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-05 09:59:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Egbert Eich from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c7)) Thank you for your work here and the detailed explanations. That's better, but with the usage of cat elif [ $(/usr/bin/stat -c %U:%G:%a %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key) != \     %munge_u:%munge_g:400 ]; then     tmpfile=$(/usr/bin/mktemp /tmp/tmpfile-XXXXXXX)     /usr/bin/cat %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key > $tmpfile fi if [ -n "$tmpfile" ]; then     /bin/chmod 0400 $tmpfile     /bin/chown -h %munge_u:%munge_g $tmpfile     /bin/mv $tmpfile %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key fi  an attacker can read arbitrary files by symlinking to them. The symlink will yield munge:munge:777 and therefor trigger the elif. cat reads the linked file and copies the content into $tmpfile, which is then transfered back  You could create a temp directory and then copy the file there without dereferencing symlinks tmpdir=$(/usr/bin/mktemp -d /tmp/tmpfile-XXXXXXX) cp -P /etc/munge/munge.key $tmpdir now you have the file in a directory that root controls. Here you can test if it's a regular file and then act on it, since the attacker can't interfere anymore ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c9)  Egbert Eich   2019-11-06 09:17:17 UTC  ``` New proposal using a temporary directory instead of just a temporary file.  unset tmpfile tmpdir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/tmpdir-XXXXXXXXX) if [ -e %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key ]; then     # Preserve symlink so we can check for it                                                                          cp -pP %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key ${tmpdir} fi # Make sure this is no symlinks - this may have been created by an attacker!                                       if [ -e ${tmpdir}/munge.key -a ! -h ${tmpdir}/munge.key ]; then     if [ $(/usr/bin/stat -c %U:%G:%a ${tmpdir}/munge.key) != \     %munge_u:%munge_g:400 ]; then         tmpfile=${tmpdir}/munge.key     fi else     /usr/bin/rm -f ${tmpdir}/munge.key     if [ -c /dev/urandom ]; then         tmpfile=${tmpdir}/munge.key         /bin/dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=1024 > $tmpfile 2>/dev/null     fi fi if [ -n "$tmpfile" ]; then     /bin/chmod 0400 $tmpfile     /bin/chown -h %munge_u:%munge_g $tmpfile     /bin/mv $tmpfile %{_sysconfdir}/munge/munge.key fi /usr/bin/rm -rf ${tmpdir} ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c10)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-06 16:51:14 UTC  ``` That looks good, but you need to add -f to the mv to handle the case where the file already exists. Can you please submit with this last change?   Thank you! ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c11)  Egbert Eich   2019-11-06 20:48:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1155075#c10)) > That looks good, but you need to add -f to the mv to handle the case where  Indeed!  > the file already exists.
