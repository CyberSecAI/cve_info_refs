## CVE-2019-3985

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improperly sanitized input when configuring the device's Wi-Fi configuration via the `ssid` parameter. User-supplied input is not properly validated.

**Weakness:** Command Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device.

**Attack vector:** By providing a crafted `ssid` parameter during device enrollment/onboarding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be adjacent to the Blink XT2 Sync Module. The attacker must bypass the existing sanitization, which only escapes quotes and command substitution characters. This can be achieved by adding extra backslashes to escape the sanitized slashes.
