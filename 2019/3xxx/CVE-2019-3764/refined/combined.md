#### Details

* Improper Authorization Vulnerability

Dell EMC iDRAC7 versions prior to 2.65.65.65, iDRAC8 versions prior to 2.70.70.70 and iDRAC9 versions prior to 3.36.36.36 contain an improper authorization vulnerability.  A remote authenticated malicious iDRAC user with low privileges may potentially exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information such as password hashes.

* Improper Authorization Vulnerability

Dell EMC iDRAC7 versions prior to 2.65.65.65, iDRAC8 versions prior to 2.70.70.70 and iDRAC9 versions prior to 3.36.36.36 contain an improper authorization vulnerability.  A remote authenticated malicious iDRAC user with low privileges may potentially exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information such as password hashes.

Dell Technologies recommends all customers consider both the CVSS base score and any relevant temporal and environmental scores that may impact the potential severity associated with a particular security vulnerability.
#### Affected Products & Remediation

**Affected products**:

* Dell EMC iDRAC7 versions prior to 2.65.65.65
* Dell EMC iDRAC8 versions prior to 2.70.70.70
* Dell EMC iDRAC9 versions prior to 3.36.36.36

**Resolution**:

 The following Dell EMC iDRAC firmware releases contain resolutions to these vulnerabilities:

| **iDRAC** | **iDRAC firmware version** |
| --- | --- |
| iDRAC9 | 3.36.36.36 |
| 3.40.40.40 |
| iDRAC8 | 2.70.70.70 |
| iDRAC7 | 2.65.65.65 |

 **Note**: iDRAC9 and iDRAC8 firmware is available as of the publication date. iDRAC7 firmware is planned to be available April 2020.

 Dell EMC recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.

 **Dell EMC Best Practices regarding iDRAC**:

 In addition to maintaining up-to-date iDRAC firmware, Dell EMC also advises the following:

* iDRACs are not designed nor intended to be placed on or connected to the internet; they are intended to be on a separate management network. Placing or connecting iDRACs directly to the internet could expose the connected system to security and other risks for which Dell EMC is not responsible.
* Along with locating iDRACs on a separate management subnet, users should isolate the management subnet/VLAN with technologies such as firewalls, and limit access to the subnet/VLAN to authorized server administrators.
* Dell EMC recommends that customers take into account any deployment factors that may be relevant to their environment to assess their overall risk.

Customers can download software from the Dell Support site:
