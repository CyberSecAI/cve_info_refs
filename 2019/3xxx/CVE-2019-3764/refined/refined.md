Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-3764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an improper authorization flaw in Dell EMC iDRAC (Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller) firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** A remote, authenticated user with low privileges can exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows the low-privileged attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as password hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack vector, requiring network access to the iDRAC interface.
- Requires prior authentication as an iDRAC user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated iDRAC user with low privileges.
- They need network access to the iDRAC interface.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Dell EMC iDRAC7 versions prior to 2.65.65.65
- Dell EMC iDRAC8 versions prior to 2.70.70.70
- Dell EMC iDRAC9 versions prior to 3.36.36.36

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade iDRAC firmware to the following versions or later:
   - iDRAC9: 3.36.36.36 or 3.40.40.40
   - iDRAC8: 2.70.70.70
   - iDRAC7: 2.65.65.65

**Additional Information:**
- Dell EMC recommends that iDRACs should not be directly connected to the internet, but rather placed on a separate management network.
- Dell EMC recommends users to isolate the management subnet/VLAN with technologies such as firewalls, and limit access to the subnet/VLAN to authorized server administrators.
- The vulnerability was reported to Dell EMC by MilCert Austrian Armed Forces.
