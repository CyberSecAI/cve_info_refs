Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-3809:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `mybackpack` functionality in Moodle allowed users to set arbitrary URLs for badges instead of restricting it to the Mozilla Open Badges backpack URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability is a blind SSRF. The server makes requests to the provided URL, potentially exposing internal resources if an attacker uses a URL pointing to internal infrastructure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Blind SSRF:** An attacker can potentially probe internal services and ports by making the Moodle server send requests to attacker-specified URLs. This allows an attacker to gather information about the internal infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to manipulate the `backpackurl` via the `mybackpack` functionality in Moodle.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user able to access and modify badge settings.
*   No specific privileged access to the server is necessary, this can be exploited by a user with standard access.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions**: Moodle versions 3.1 to 3.1.15 and earlier unsupported versions.
*   **Fixed Versions**: Moodle version 3.1.16.
*  The fix involves restricting the URL to the Mozilla Open Badges backpack URL.
