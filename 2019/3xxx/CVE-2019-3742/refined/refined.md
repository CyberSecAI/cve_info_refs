The provided content is related to CVE-2019-3742.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in Dell/Alienware Digital Delivery versions prior to 3.5.2013. It stems from a named pipe that performs binary deserialization, which is then exploited via a process hollowing technique.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe binary deserialization of data from a named pipe
- Process hollowing technique

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local non-privileged attacker can inject malicious code and execute it with elevated (SYSTEM) privileges. This leads to a privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access is required. The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable named pipe.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system
- Ability to manipulate the named pipe used by the application
- The attacker is a non-privileged user.
