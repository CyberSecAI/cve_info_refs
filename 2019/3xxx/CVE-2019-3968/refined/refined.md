Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `/contrib/forms/scanned_notes/new.php` script of OpenEMR. The script takes user-supplied input via the `id` GET parameter and uses it to construct a command that is later executed on the host operating system using the `exec()` function. Crucially, this user-controlled input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being incorporated into the command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. The `$formid` variable is taken directly from the GET parameter `id`, then directly placed into a command string, leading to command injection.
*   **Insecure use of `exec()`:** The PHP `exec()` function is used to execute the command on the operating system. This function should generally be avoided with user supplied data, or user supplied data should be properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system, with the privileges of the web server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the environment configuration and the specific commands injected, an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the server, install malware, steal sensitive data, or use it as a pivot point to attack other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`/contrib/forms/scanned_notes/new.php`).
*  **`id` parameter:** The `id` GET parameter is used to inject the malicious command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user within the OpenEMR system who has access to the "scanned notes" feature.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the OpenEMR application to send the malicious HTTP request.
