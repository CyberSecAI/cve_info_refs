{
  "CVE-2019-3819": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function hid_debug_events_read() in drivers/hid/hid-debug.c file which may enter an infinite loop with certain parameters passed from a userspace. A local privileged user (\"root\") can cause a system lock up and a denial of service. Versions from v4.18 and newer are vulnerable.",
    "Root cause": "The hid_debug_events_read() function in the Linux kernel does not properly validate parameters passed from userspace, potentially leading to an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Infinite loop"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system lock up).",
    "Attack vector": "Local",
    "Required capabilities": "Local privileged user (root).",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability exists in the debugfs interface under /sys/kernel/debug/hid, which is typically only accessible to root. This effectively mitigates the issue in most cases. The issue affects Linux kernel versions 4.18 and later."
