{
  "CVE-2019-3879": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that in the ovirt REST API, RemoveDiskCommand is triggered as an internal command, meaning the permission validation that should be performed against the calling user is skipped. A user with low privileges (e.g. Basic Operations) could exploit this flaw to delete disks attached to guests.",
    "Root cause": "The `RemoveDiskCommand` was being executed as an internal command, bypassing permission checks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing permissions check in the REST API when deleting a disk.",
      "The `RemoveDiskCommand` was incorrectly classified as internal, thus skipping permission checks."
    ],
    "Impact": "Users with basic privileges (e.g., those with VM/Basic Operations role) could delete disks attached to virtual machines, leading to data loss or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Making a REST API call to delete a disk (`DELETE /ovirt-engine/api/disks/DISK_ID?async=true`)."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to have a user account with basic privileges (e.g., VM/Basic Operations permissions).",
      "The attacker needs to be able to make REST API calls to the ovirt-engine."
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `RemoveDiskCommand` is called with `async=true` in the REST API request, which causes the engine to execute the action internally, skipping permission checks. The issue was addressed by ensuring that the permission validation is performed against the calling user even when triggered as an internal command."
