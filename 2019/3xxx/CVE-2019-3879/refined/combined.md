The original bug is: +++ +++   [bug 1642872](show_bug.cgi?id=1642872 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3879 ovirt-engine: Missing permissions check in web ui allows a user with basic privileges to delete disks [rhev-m-4.3.0]") +++ ======================================================================  Description of problem: It looks like a new role provides more permissions than it is expected. A new role having: "Reboot VM, Stop VM, Shut Down VM, Hibernate VM, Run VM, Change CD, Remote Log in" is able to delete a VM or its disk.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 4.2.6  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. create a new role, check everything from VM/Basic Operations 2. assing a new user with the new role 3. delete any V you wish  Actual results: VM is deleted  Expected results: it is not allowed  (Originally by Olimp Bockowski)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c2)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:26:55 UTC  ``` I cannot reproduce this. What were the exact steps to reproduce?  I tried these steps: 1. Create a custom role, only with action groups in VM/Basic Operations 2. Create a new VM 3. Add permission to the VM for the user with the custom role. 4. Log into VM portal as the user 5. Try to remove the VM  The operation is not successful as expected. Error message:   Failed to remove the VM [User is not authorized to perform this action.]   Tested on: 4.2.8-0.0.master.20181101130712.git326ea78.el7  (Originally by Andrej Krejcir)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c3)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:26:56 UTC  ``` Olimp, ping?

The user can delete the disk of VM."  However, it is very weird, because for me it is still the problem that I can do whatever. I haven't checked it thoroughly, just from Admin Portal and:  1. I created the role: bugtest (I am not sure which user I used for that, maybe it is curcial). Basic Operations only. 2. I removed myself (obockows LDAP user) from RHV using admin 3. I created a new permission obockows + bugtest role 4. on user list I have a different icon than on system permission: icon of admin instead of user (screenshot attached) 5. I can delete whatever  maybe I missed something? that's odd.  olimpb  (Originally by Olimp Bockowski)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c5)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:27:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1506508](attachment.cgi?id=1506508 "role") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1506508&action=edit "role") role  (Originally by Olimp Bockowski)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c6)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:27:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1506509](attachment.cgi?id=1506509 "permissions") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1506509&action=edit "permissions") permissions  (Originally by Olimp Bockowski)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c7)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:27:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1506510](attachment.cgi?id=1506510 "users") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1506510&action=edit "users") users  (Originally by Olimp Bockowski)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c8)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:27:05 UTC  ``` Hello,   is there any progress on this?

There's no logcollector in the case, and the screenshot is too cropped to see it either way  (Originally by Ryan Barry)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c10)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:27:08 UTC  ``` I have tired the steps right now and I still cannot reproduce it.  The user cannot connect to admin UI, which is expected, because he does not have any admin role. In the VM portal, the Edit button is grayed out, so there is no way to delete a disk. Using the API to delete the disk is also not permitted:   DELETE ovirt-engine/api/disks/1f33970f-89fb-40fb-97e0-424c259b70f5  <fault>     <detail>[User is not authorized to perform this action.]</detail>     <reason>Operation Failed</reason> </fault>   Can you check if the user has any other roles on any objects (Data Center, Cluster, Storage Domain, VM), that could permit deleting a disk?  (Originally by Andrej Krejcir)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c11)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:27:09 UTC  ``` @Andrej - 1. have you tried to reproduce my case? e.g. I added a user as admin (using ldap as provider), then I deleted, I added user again with User Role - a new user was able to delete everything. Maybe the problem is that removing user, doesn't remove permission for containing elements?   2. regardng your question:  ok I see we have to dig into log collector provided by the customer  (Originally by Olimp Bockowski)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1692380#c12)  RHV bug bot    2019-03-25 13:27:11 UTC  ``` I tried it now, these steps:  1. Give a user 'test-user' the 'SuperUser' role in Administration -> Configure -> System Permissions 2. Log in as 'test-user' to Admin portal 3. Remove the 'test-user' from System Permissions 4. Try to add 'test-user' again, but an error is shown: 'Error while executing action: User is not authorized to perform this action.'  It makes sense. Once the test-user looses SuperUser permissions, he cannot add a user to system permissions.  Then I logged in as 'admin', added the 'test-user' with the test role to the system permissions. And still everything works as expected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1684978#c0)  Doran Moppert    2019-03-04 04:09:00 UTC  ``` It was discovered that in the ovirt REST API, RemoveDiskCommand is triggered as an internal command, meaning the permission validation that should be performed against the calling user is skipped.  A user with low privileges (eg Basic Operations) could exploit this flaw to delete disks attached to guests.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1684978#c2)  Doran Moppert    2019-04-03 06:36:56 UTC  ``` Upstream fix:  <https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/98153/>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1684978#c4)  Sandro Bonazzola    2019-04-29 07:30:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Doran Moppert from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1684978#c2)) > Upstream fix: >  > <https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/98153/>  $ git tag --contains b6840a6c6221470c31e5f4d9f718239a9d44149d ovirt-engine-4.3.2.1 ovirt-engine-4.3.3 ovirt-engine-4.3.3.1 ovirt-engine-4.3.3.2 ovirt-engine-4.3.3.3 ovirt-engine-4.3.3.4 ovirt-engine-4.3.3.5 ovirt-engine-4.3.3.6   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1684978#c6)  Doran Moppert    2019-04-29 08:19:13 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in the following erratum for Red Hat Virtualization 4.2:  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0802](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019%3A0802)   ``` |  |
