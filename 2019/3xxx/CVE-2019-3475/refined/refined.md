## CVE-2019-3475

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-3475:

**Description:** Local privilege escalation vulnerability in the `famtd` component of Micro Focus Filr 3.0 and 3.4.0.217.

**Root Cause:** The `famtd` binary, located at `/opt/novell/filr/bin/famtd`, is owned by the `wwwrun` user. This binary is executed with root privileges during startup via the `/etc/init.d/novell-famtd` init script. An attacker who can execute arbitrary commands as the `wwwrun` user can replace the legitimate `famtd` binary with a malicious script or binary. Upon server reboot, this malicious code will execute with root privileges, leading to privilege escalation.

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The `famtd` binary and its containing directory have permissions that allow modification by the `wwwrun` user.
*   **Unvalidated Execution:** The init script `/etc/init.d/novell-famtd` directly executes `/opt/novell/filr/bin/famtd` without proper validation of its integrity.

**Attack Vector:**

1.  Attacker gains arbitrary command execution as the `wwwrun` user on the Filr appliance.
2.  Attacker replaces the legitimate `famtd` binary ( `/opt/novell/filr/bin/famtd`) with a malicious script or binary designed to create a SUID backdoor or perform other privileged actions.
3.  The Filr appliance is rebooted.
4.  The `/etc/init.d/novell-famtd` script executes the attacker's malicious code with root privileges.
5.  The attacker uses the created SUID backdoor to gain root access or otherwise exploits the elevated privileges.

**Impact:**

*   Full system compromise: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain root privileges on the Filr appliance.

**Required Capabilities:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary commands as the `wwwrun` user on the Filr appliance. This could be achieved through other vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2019-3474, path traversal) or compromised credentials.

**Remediation:**

*   Apply Filr 3.0 Security Update 6, which addresses the reported issues.
