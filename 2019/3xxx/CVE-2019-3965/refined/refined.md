Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-3965:

**CVE-2019-3965**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `controller.php` file within the OpenEMR application. Specifically, the `document_id` parameter is vulnerable to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize the `document_id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    *   Potentially gaining unauthorized access to OpenEMR functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `document_id` parameter. The victim needs to click the malicious URL for the attack to be successful.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking this malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in the `controller.php` file. The `document_id` parameter is directly taken from the URL without proper sanitization.

**Proof of Concept:**
```
http://<openemr host>/controller.php?document&clear_procedure_tag&patient_id=0&document_id=1"><script>alert("XSS")</script>
```

**Affected Versions:**
OpenEMR version 5.0.1 and earlier are affected.

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade to the latest available version of OpenEMR (5.0.2).

**Additional Notes:**
This vulnerability is one of several found in OpenEMR. These vulnerabilities were disclosed to OpenEMR maintainers. This particular XSS vulnerability is considered "medium" severity.
