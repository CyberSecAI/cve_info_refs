{
    "CVE-2019-3886": {
        "description": "An incorrect permissions check was discovered in libvirt 4.8.0 and above. The readonly permission was allowed to invoke APIs depending on the guest agent, which could lead to potentially disclosing unintended information or denial of service by causing libvirt to block.",
        "vulnerability_details": {
            "root_cause": "Incorrect permissions check in libvirt, specifically allowing read-only permissions to invoke APIs that interact with the guest agent.",
            "weaknesses": [
                "Incorrect authorization",
                "Information disclosure",
                 "Denial of service"
            ],
            "impact": "Information exposure (guest hostname) and potential denial of service due to libvirt blocking.",
            "attack_vectors": [
                "Remote access via guest agent",
                "Local access to libvirt socket"
            ],
             "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with read-only access to the libvirt API can exploit this vulnerability. Typically, in hypervisor environments, local user accounts are not supported."
