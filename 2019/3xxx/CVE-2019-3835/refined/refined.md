  "CVE-2019-3835": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in ghostscript, versions 9.x before 9.50, in the setsystemparams procedure where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary commands.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `superexec` operator was accessible in the internal dictionary, allowing a specially crafted PostScript file to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure use of the `superexec` operator.",
         "Improper handling of privileged calls in the setsystemparams procedure.",
          "Bypass of `-dSAFER` restrictions."

      "impact": "A specially crafted PostScript file can disable security protections, gain file system access, and execute arbitrary commands.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted PostScript files.",
         "Via a network where a vulnerable service processes the file."
