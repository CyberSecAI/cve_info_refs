Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-3784:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an insecure session management in Cloud Foundry Stratos, specifically the use of an embedded SQLite database by default when deployed with multiple instances.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Session Collision:** The vulnerability allows for session spoofing due to the insecure session implementation. When multiple Stratos instances are used with the default SQLite database, a malicious user can switch to another user's session if they have the same session ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated remote attacker can impersonate another user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data or functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of Stratos.
- The attacker must be able to access a Stratos deployment with multiple instances using the default embedded SQLite database.
