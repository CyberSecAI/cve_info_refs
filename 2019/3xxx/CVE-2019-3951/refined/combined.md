While developing a Nessus plugin to detect [CVE-2019-3975](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3975), Tenable found an unauthenticated remote stack overflow vulnerability in Advantech WebAccess/SCADA 8.4.2 The flaw exists in the LogInfoFormat function in BwPAlarm.dll due to improper validation of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-size stack-based buffer when processing an IOCTL 70533 RPC message:

```

.text:07023E4A                                    ; can overflow the fixed_size,
.text:07023E4A                                    ; 0x800-byte stack buffer.
.text:07023E51      lea     edx, [esp+800h+sbuf]  ; 0x800-byte stack buffer
.text:07023E55      push    eax
.text:07023E56      push    ecx
.text:07023E57      push    edx
.text:07023E58      call    _vsprintf

```

Here an unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a large amount of data to overflow a 0x800-byte stack buffer via the vsprintf function.
