Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1002101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `kubectl cp` command's mishandling of symbolic links when copying files between containers and the user's machine. Specifically, the client-side `untar` function, despite attempts to strip path traversals, could be exploited using symbolic links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incomplete sanitization of paths during file copy operations.
- The `untar` function, while trying to strip path traversals, allowed for the creation and following of symbolic links.
- Reliance on the tar binary within the container, which could be malicious and manipulated to output unexpected results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file write: A malicious container could cause files to be created or replaced at any location on the user's workstation.
- Potential for privilege escalation if a user with higher privileges was tricked into executing the malicious command.
- Data loss, data corruption, or system compromise could result from a successful attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious container: A compromised container with a malicious `tar` binary could be used as the source of files to be copied via `kubectl cp`.
- User interaction: The attack relies on a user executing the `kubectl cp` command targeting a malicious container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs control over the container that is the source of the file copy operation.
- They don't need access to the user's machine, but the user needs to initiate the file copy using `kubectl cp` command.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Incomplete Fixes:**  The content mentions "Incomplete fixes for CVE-2019-1002101" and CVE-2019-11246, indicating the vulnerability was not fully addressed in initial patches and required further remediation.
*  **Client-Side Defect:** The vulnerability is noted as a "client-side defect," emphasizing that the issue lies within the kubectl tool rather than a server-side component.
*   **Upgrades Required:** The content consistently urges users to upgrade their `kubectl` clients to specific versions to mitigate the risk.
*   **Specific Versions:** The provided information specifies which versions are vulnerable (e.g., Kubernetes 1.7.x-1.12.x, 1.13.0-1.13.8, 1.14.0-1.14.4, 1.15.0-1.15.1 ) and what versions address the issue (Kubernetes 1.11.9, 1.12.7, 1.13.5, and 1.14.0 or later).
*   **Mitigation:** Before upgrading, users were advised to remove authorization rules granting access to cluster-scoped resources within namespaces.
*   **Fix:** The fix implemented involves ensuring that symlinks are properly handled by stripping path traversals and making sure the destination paths are valid.
*   **Red Hat OpenShift:** The content also shows that Red Hat was addressing this vulnerability in various OpenShift releases, issuing errata to patch the affected components.
*   **Fedora:** Fedora was also addressing this vulnerability in its kubernetes package by providing updates.

**Summary:**
The CVE-2019-1002101 vulnerability, as described in the content, is a client-side issue with the `kubectl cp` command. An attacker could exploit this through a malicious container, causing the `kubectl` client to write files to arbitrary locations on the user's machine. The vulnerability highlights the importance of using patched versions of Kubernetes and kubectl, as well as proper access control configurations to mitigate these kinds of risks.
