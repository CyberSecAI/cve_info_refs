Description

Initial Release
Added CVE-2020-0566 related details, added Intel CPU-based
security technologies that are not impacted by CVE-2019-0090

Purpose of the white paper
The purpose of this white paper is to provide technical details to help understand the Intel®
Converged Security Management Engine (CSME) IOMMU (Input Output Memory Management Unit)
Hardware issue (CVE-2019-0090), how it could be potentially exploited, and the resulting impact of a
successful exploitation.

The white paper also discusses the different CSME Firmware workarounds made to help prevent
exploitation of CVE-2019-0090 and what steps are recommended to protect systems against
potential attacks.

CVE-2019-0090 is the original CVE that describes the CSME IOMMU HW vulnerability and provides
initial mitigations. CVE-2020-0566 provides mitigation for additional attack vector on specific
platforms.

While most of the technical information contained in this white paper was already documented
publicly as part of a Black Hat presentation on CSME in August 2019 by Intel security researchers, the
intent of the white paper is to augment that information further in light of recent public disclosures
regarding the security of the CSME on certain Intel products.

Background
The Platform Controller Hub (PCH)/SoC consists of a set of hardware blocks (aka IP or IPs) connected
by an internal fabric, as illustrated in figure hereafter. The CSME is one of those hardware blocks. It
is important to note that this figure is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the exact
hardware block diagram for PCH and SoC products.

4

One of the main roles of the CSME in the PCH/SoC is to authenticate and load Intel and System
Manufacturer Firmware (FW) into relevant IPs such as the Power Management Controller (PMC) and
Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH). This requires the CSME to communicate over the fabric with other IPs.
This communication is done with a transaction type known as Root Space 1 (RS1); each IP’s
transactions are tagged by hardware with the IP’s identifier.  This is known as the Security Attribute
of Initiator (SAI).  One class of transactions is Direct Memory Access (DMA) transaction types to/from
CSME.

The CSME has a dedicated, access-control logic in the Input-Output Memory Management Unit
(IOMMU) that controls which IPs can send DMA transactions to specific areas in CSME SRAM. This
access control is based on IP SAI and is controlled solely by CSME ring 0 Firmware components:
ROM, RBE (ROM Boot Extension – first Firmware component executed by ROM), and Kernel. The
CSME Hardware block diagram below highlights the IOMMU inside CSME and its main security role
therein.

5

CVE-2019-0090
By default, when CSME is out of reset, the IOMMU is disabled, and there is a small window of several
hundred microseconds that allows RS1 DMA transactions to reach CSME SRAM before CSME ROM
turns on the IOMMU protection. This window can be used by an IP having RS1 DMA capability to
read and write to CSME SRAM during CSME ROM execution, potentially compromising
confidentiality of the CSME SRAM or integrity of the CSME ROM through other techniques such as
Return Oriented Programming (ROP).

In order to mount a successful attack, an attacker would need to do one of the following:

1.  Compromise Firmware of an IP having RS1 DMA capability, i.e., Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH)

on Cannon Point (CNP) PCH

2.  Bypass Root of Trust (RoT) protection, install and run attacker’s own Firmware in an IP
having RS1 DMA capability on a system that has not had End of Manufacturing (EOM)
applied. Firmware that can be customized by system manufacturers (i.e., ISH, Audio DSP) is
authenticated by CSME Firmware using a manufacturer’s public key hash, which is stored in
SPI flash. Note that when EOM is successfully applied by a system manufacturer, fuse
emulation in flash is disabled and instead Field Programmable Fuses (FPF) in PCH/SoC would
be used by CSME Firmware to authenticate and load customized, system manufacturer’s
Firmware IP.

3.  Achieve direct access to RS1 DMA capability

A successful attack would also require that the attacker’s IP firmware executes while CSME is coming
out of reset, for example during system boot or resume from CSME low-power mode (aka Power
Gating) if supported by Firmware SKU or CSME reset.

Positive Technology’s security research team utilized a Cannon Point (CNP) PCH-based platform with
no EOM applied.  Onto this platform, they loaded their own ISH Firmware by storing the hash of
their public key in fuse emulation in SPI flash. Then they either triggered a CSME reset using CSME
manufacturing command or waited for the CSME to resume from low-power state. Under these
limited conditions, they were then able to trigger an RS1 DMA transaction targeting CSME SRAM
during the small window where CSME IOMMU is not enabled yet by CSME ROM.

The Mitigation
Intel has mitigated CVE-2019-0090 in newer systems by making the IOMMU enabled by default in
CSME Hardware, so when CSME ROM starts executing, RS1 DMA transactions are blocked until the
CSME Firmware grants access to specific SRAM area. The following systems already include the
hardware fix:

Icelake (ICP-LP and ICP-N PCH)

1.
2.  Cometlake (CMP-LP, CMP-H and CMP-V PCH)
3.  Tigerlake (TGP-LP and TGP-H PCH)
4.  Lakefield (LKF SoC)
5.  Whitley (LBG-R PCH)
6.
Idaville (CDF PCH)
7.  Jacobsville (CDF PCH)
8.  Eagle Stream (EBG PCH)
9.  Tatlow (TGP-H PCH)

6

On other systems, where the CSME ROM is integrally part of the PCH/SoC Hardware and does not
have any patching mechanism, the IOMMU is potentially vulnerable.  In these cases, CSME Firmware
updates have been released to help prevent RS1 DMA transaction from reaching CSME SRAM while
the IOMMU is disabled.

There is a limited list of IPs that have RS1 DMA capability to read and write to CSME for PCH and
SoC, which are impacted by CVE-2019-0090. This list differs from one PCH / SoC generation to
another.

For CNP-based systems, the CSME Firmware update blocks RS1 DMA transactions to the CSME at the
PCH fabric level before the CSME enters low-power mode (aka Power Gating) or initiates a CSME
reset. Once resuming from Power Gating or CSME reset is completed and once the IOMMU is
enabled, the CSME Firmware is designed to reconfigure the PCH fabric to unblock RS1 DMA
transactions. Note this change relies on PMC Firmware’s control of power management flows in the
PCH/SoC and ability to reset individual IPs like the CSME.

CVE-2020-0566

For BXT-P and GLK-based platforms, the CSME Firmware change consists of disabling USB DbC
(debug capability) interface when end of manufacturing has been applied to the system and SoC
debug interface is closed. The goal of the firmware update is to prevent an attacker with physical
access to a system from connecting to that system via a USB DbC interface and issuing an RS1 DMA
transaction when the CSME resumes from Power Gating or a CSME reset has been completed, as
described in CVE-2020-0566.

For other systems, the latest CSME Firmware version can prevent known attack vectors (except for
physical rollback to CSME Firmware versions previously vulnerable to Intel-SA-00086).

Hardware-based Anti-rollback (ARB)
In order to properly mitigate physical attack vectors, the CSME Hardware-based, Anti-rollback
capability (ARB) must be supported by the PCH/SoC and enabled by system manufacturers. This
capability will prevent a physical rollback of the CSME Firmware in flash and provide assurances that
the system remains protected against known vulnerabilities that have been mitigated in the most
recent CSME Firmware release.

This table summarizes in which PCH/SoC and under which conditions Hardware-based ARB is
supported.

The Impact of CVE-2019-0090
CVE-2019-0090 might allow an attacker to assert control of the CSME ROM execution and gain
access to CSME chipset and attestation keys: the Intel® Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) private key and
the Intel® Platform Trust Technology (PTT) Endorsement Key (EK).  Those keys are unique to a given
system. Refer to later sections to understand the role played by chipset key and EPID private key in
CSME. In addition, CVE-2019-0090 might allow an attacker to load their own CSME Firmware and
compromise the CSME use-cases on the system.

The table hereafter lists the different use cases supported by CSME and how they could be
potentially impacted by CVE-2019-0090.

The latest CSME Firmware includes mitigations for the CSME IOMMU Hardware issue against known
attacks. When Hardware-based ARB capability is supported and enabled by system manufacturer
(including BIOS support), the CSME will only accept the latest CSME Firmware, mitigating against
physical FW-rollback attacks.

In addition, EOM should have been applied by system manufacturer before shipment, as specified in
Intel guidelines to system manufacturers.  EOM specified the following:

1.  SPI descriptor, containing access control list on different region (i.e., BIOS, CSME), is locked
and cannot be changed by Software. The access control is then enforced by SPI controller.
2.  SPI Flash-based fuse emulation is disabled and Field Programmable Fuses in PCH or SoC are

used instead.

3.  CSME Manufacturing API is disabled.

It is important to note that the following Intel CPU-based security technologies are not impacted by
CVE-2019-0090:

1.

2.

3.

Intel®️ Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), if used with a discrete TPM and not Intel PTT. TXT
in this white paper refers to Intel CPU Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) that
establishes a new Trusted Computing Base (TCB) starting from the CPU micro-code and not a
specific TXT usage by a specific Measured Launched Environment (MLE) or Virtual Machine
Manager (VMM).
Intel SGX, except the secure time and monotonic counter provided by CSME DAL only on
client platform
Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d): proper configuration of Intel VT-d
prevents rogue DMA access to system memory via a compromised CSME, because such
memory access conforms to Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) memory transactions,
which include CSME devices’ PCI Bus/Device/Function (BDFs) that can be managed by VT-d.

Yes1 – Intel Node Manager functionality provides telemetry only, no system power management.

Yes2 – Use case is supported only on Intel® Workstations Systems that run CSME Firmware. On
Server (Intel® Server Platform Services Firmware), the use case is not supported.

Yes3 – Use case is supported only on Server that runs Intel® Server Platform Services (SPS) Firmware.
On Workstation or Client (CSME Firmware), the use case is not supported.

The “Firmware authentication for IP” use case might also differ between client and server. For
example, even though ISH Hardware exists in CNP-H PCH used on server platform, SPS Firmware
does not support loading of ISH Firmware.

The Chipset Key and the Fuse Encryption Hardware Key
The CSME Chipset Key is the master of all keys generated by the CSME ROM and by CSME Firmware
at runtime. All chipset keys are randomly generated by Intel’s Key Generator Facility (KGF) for PCH
and SoC products, encrypted with a PCH/SOC family Hardware Key (the Fuse Encryption Hardware
Key), and sent to Intel Assembly facilities for final programming with other security keys in the
PCH/SOC manufacturing fuses before shipment to system manufacturers.

The Fuse Encryption Hardware Key serves to prevent CSME security keys from being exposed, should
they be successfully extracted from the fuses.

Note the Fuse Encryption Hardware Key is not meant to protect chipset key and EPID private key
from the CSME ROM. More explanations on that are provided in later sections.

Usage of the Chipset Key and Fuse Encryption Hardware Key by
the CSME ROM
When the CSME ROM starts executing, it will perform the following sequence:

1.  ROM requests from the Crypto Hardware accelerator to generate the Fuse Encryption

Hardware Key

2.  ROM sets up Secure Key Storage (SKS) slot attributes (privilege level, secure mode, and lock)

before loading the Fuse Encryption Hardware Key into the SKS Hardware.

3.  ROM pulls security keys from fuses into the CSME SRAM.  Once complete, security key fuses
are locked. Thereafter, security keys cannot be retrieved until the next CSME reset, thereby
providing assurances that only the CSME ROM can retrieve the security keys.

4.  ROM decrypts the chipset key encrypted with the Hardware Key from CSME SRAM into SKS
5.  ROM can use the chipset key to derive additional keys using HMAC-SHA256 as a Key

Derivation Function and hard-coded string (different per key) and CSME Firmware Security
Version Number after the CSME Firmware manifest has been verified by CSME ROM.

11

Several keys are created by ROM using the Chipset Key:

1.  Wrapping Key – this key is used to wrap key in SRAM and to ensure the key is unwrapped

into SKS before it can be used. Once a key is wrapped, it is bound to the CSME Hardware and
cannot be used outside CSME.

2.  Memory Guard Key – this key is used to wrap and unwrap key in SRAM. This key is typically
used to protect attestation keys like EPID or EK that cannot be stored in SKS, which supports
only AES or HMAC key type.

3.  Suspend Key – this key is used to generate one-time keys that would allow to save and

4.

5.

restore CSME Firmware context while CSME enters Power Gating or when platform goes
into standby on client system only. This key is critical to guarantee CSME execution integrity
upon resume.
Intel Root Key – this key is the master key for the CSME firmware. For example, it is used to
generate storage keys that would protect CSME data in NVM.
IVB Root Key – this key is used to protect the Integrity Protection Key (IPK) and the CSME
Firmware modules’ ICVs (Integrity Check Value calculated using IPK and Crypto Hardware
accelerator AES-Paging engine over CSME Firmware module’s 4KB pages) in NVM. The ICVs
allow faster boot of CSME Firmware and to securely page out and page in CSME code and
data from CSME SRAM to SPI flash/DRAM. IPK and ICV are invalidated upon CSME Firmware
update or an ICV integrity failure. This key is critical to guarantee CSME execution integrity
during boot and runtime.

6.  Provisioning Key – this key is used by the CSME Firmware to retrieve a new EPID private key
from Intel server when a TCB Recovery is required, because the CSME EPID attestation key
has been compromised. The Provisioning Key is based on CSME Firmware SVN. The usage of
this key is relevant only when the SVN is greater than 1.

7.  PTT EK Root Key – this key would be exported by CSME ROM, encrypted with Memory Guard
key, and used by Intel PTT to generate its Endorsement Key using the PTT EK counters also
exported by CSME ROM to Intel PTT.

12

Once the CSME ROM generates all keys, it will zero and lock the Chipset Key and the Fuse Encryption
Hardware Key before executing CSME Firmware. This is done to ensure these two keys cannot be
used outside the CSME Firmware.

As shown above, CSME execution integrity and data security rely on the chipset key and keys created
from it by the CSME ROM.

The EPID Private Key
The KGF is responsible for generating all CSME EPID private keys, group public keys, and associated
certificates. During Intel manufacturing of the PCH or SoC, the CSME is provisioned with its unique
EPID private key encrypted with the Family Fuse Encryption Key and the EPID group ID.

At CSME boot, the EPID private key is decrypted by the CSME ROM and exported to the CSME
Firmware, where the key is managed by the SIGMA module. Then, PAVP, DAL, and PTT can utilize the
SIGMA protocol to prove to a server (i.e., content provider) they are running inside a genuine CSME
Firmware. The EPID private key is used to generate an EPID signature to prove membership in an
EPID group to a verifier (i.e., content provider server). The verifier authenticates a member (the
CSME Firmware) by checking the member’s signature with the group certificate.

If EPID private key is compromised, then the CSME Firmware can be potentially impersonated, and
verifiers’ ability to guarantee that they are communicating with a genuine CSME Firmware is
compromised. In such a scenario, new EPID private keys can be issued, and the compromised EPID
private key or its associated EPID group can be revoked by Intel.  This procedure is called TCB
recovery and has coincided with the mitigation of a particular vulnerability undermining the CSME
Firmware TCB or exposing the EPID private key itself.  Examples include those vulnerabilities
documented in Intel-SA-00086 (CVE-2017-5705, CVE-2017-5706, and CVE-2017-5707). The figure
hereafter highlights the steps required to successfully complete the TCB recovery.

KGF will have to generate new EPID private keys and send them to Intel server. Intel server will
deliver the new EPID private key only to the new CSME Firmware with higher SVN. This is achieved

13

by using the Provisioning Key generated by ROM using the CSME Firmware SVN as explained in
previous section. It is important to note that if the CSME ROM is also compromised, then TCB
recovery cannot be done securely anymore.

Usage of Secure Key Storage (SKS) Hardware
The CSME ROM also uses the SKS Hardware to protect keys from potential leakage from CSME
SRAM, while CSME Firmware runs, and to ensure CSME Firmware can use keys without knowing
their actual plaintext values. Note, the CSME ROM cannot make use of an SKS slot with secure mode
set for the Fuse Encryption Key and Chipset Key for the following reasons:

1.  The EPID private key stored in fuse is not an AES or HMAC key and, as a result, cannot be

loaded in SKS. Therefore, the key needs to be decrypted using the Fuse Encryption Hardware
Key in CSME SRAM where it gets wrapped by CSME ROM with Memory Guard Key before it
gets exported to CSME Firmware.

2.  The chipset key is also used to generate an EPID random value that would be used by the

CSME Firmware to generate the final EPID private key using the EPID private key. The EPID
random value is also wrapped by CSME ROM with Memory Guard Key before it gets
exported to CSME Firmware.
