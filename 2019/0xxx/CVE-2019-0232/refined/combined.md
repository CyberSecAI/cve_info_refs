* [Get in touch](/en_us/business/get-info-form.html)

![icon](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/core/images/icons/reference/pillar-icn.svg)

#### Go beyond next-gen IPS

Detect and block attacks through preemptive threat prevention, threat insight and prioritization, and real-time enforcement and remediation.

Defend the network from the edge, to the data center, and to the cloud, leveraging machine learning to detect and mitigate threats.

![icon](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/core/images/icons/reference/pillar-icn.svg)

#### Performance scalability

Unprecedented security and performance for high-capacity networks with a scalable deployment model that includes the industry’s first 100 Gbps Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) in a 1U form factor, with the ability to scale up to .5Tbps (500 Gbps) aggregate in a 5U form factor.

![icon](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/core/images/icons/reference/pillar-icn.svg)

#### Comprehensive threat insight and prioritization

Gain complete visibility across your network with the insight and context needed to measure and drive vulnerability threat prioritization. Deep inspection of network traffic identifies and blocks threats undetected by traditional security solutions.

On-box SSL inspection reduces security blind spots created by encrypted traffic.

## **Flexible deployment and investment protection**

With flexible deployment options that are easy to set up and manage through a centralized management interface, TippingPoint provides immediate and ongoing threat protection with out-of-the-box recommended settings.

* Simplify security operations
* Reassign licenses across TPS deployments without changing network infrastructure

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 74 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  70 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2650675.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2650675.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  5 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2633852.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2633852.1).

COLLECTED BY

Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/NO404)

These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.

Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.

The goal is to [fix all broken links on the web](https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/).
Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.

Collection: [GDELT](https://archive.org/details/NO404-GDELT)

A daily crawl of more than 200,000 home pages of news sites, including the pages linked from those home pages. Site list provided by [The GDELT Project](http://gdeltproject.org/about.html)

# Everyone quotes command line arguments the wrong way

★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★

![avatar of dancol](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344im_/https://i1.social.s-msft.com/profile/u/avatar.jpg?displayname=Daniel++Colascione&size=extralarge&version=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

# Background

At one time or another, we all need to pass arbitrary command line arguments to some program. These arguments could be filenames, debugging flags, hostnames, or any other kind of information: the point is that we are to take a string and make sure some child program receives exactly that string in its [argv array](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bky3b5dh.aspx) no matter what this string contains. The task is [harder than it appears](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//www.perseus.tufts.edu/Herakles/stables.html).

For better or for worse1, Windows knows about only [one command line string](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683156%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) for each process. Because one string is not terribly useful, libraries conspire to provide the illusion of multiple command line arguments: before creating a subprocess, a program combines all argument strings into one command line string, and the newly-born subprocess, before calling main, [splits this string into arguments](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) and passes the arguments as `argv`. In principle, each program can parse the command line string differently, but most use the [convetion](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/09/17/10063629.aspx) that [CommandLineToArgvW](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776391%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) and the Microsoft C library understand. This convention is a [good one](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/https%3A//secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bijective_function) because it provides a way to encode *any* command line argument as part of a command line string without losing information.

The problem is that there is no ArgvToCommandLineW. How do we construct an argument string understood by CommandLineToArgvW?

## Test program

For exposition’s sake, we’ll be using this small program to generate the example output below:

```

#include <stdio.h>
int __cdecl
wmain(int, wchar_t** argv)
{
    for (int arg = 0; argv[arg]; ++arg) {
        wprintf (L"%d: [%s]\n", arg, argv[arg]);
    }
}

```
# Popular solutions: clear, simple, and wrong

## The C runtime library is useless

Our first instinct should be look for a library function that’s already solved the problem. Were we to conduct this search, we would quickly find functions provided by the C runtime specifically for running subprocesses: the [\_exec](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/431x4c1w.aspx) and [\_spawn](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/20y988d2.aspx) families. These functions *appear* to be precisely what we need: they take an arbitrary number of distinct command line arguments and promise to launch a subprocess. Unfortunately and counter-intuitively, these functions do not quote or process these arguments: instead, they’re all concatenated into a single string, with arguments separated spaces, and this string is then passed to the child, where it’s eventually interpreted by CommandLineToArgvW. This approach works only for arguments that do not themselves contain spaces.

Thus, if we run child.exe like this:

```
_spawnlp (_P_WAIT, L"child.exe", L"child.exe", L"argument 1", L"argument 2", NULL)
```

child.exe receives *five* command line parameters:

```

0: [child.exe]
1: [argument]
2: [1]
3: [argument]
4: [2]

```

That’s not what we want! So, while the C runtime process-launching functions appear to be what we need, they’re actually useless for solving the command line argument problem.

## Adding quotation marks is insufficient

Having seen the problems with the previous approach, one might suggest that we heed the advice provided in the the C runtime documentation and surround arguments containing spaces with double-quote characters. This solution is also wrong.

Recall2 that the [CommandLineToArgV convention](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx)3 stipulates that arguments containing spaces be surrounded by double quotation marks. Following the above approach and surrounding arguments with quotation marks produces good results for simple cases, and many people stop here.

```

child.exe argument1 "argument 2"  "\some\path with\spaces"

```

Is correctly interpreted as:

```

0: [child.exe]
1: [argument1]
2: [argument 2]
3: [\some\path with\spaces]

```

So far, so good: but what if our arguments are more complex? Bear in mind that our convention *also* stipulates that we precede a double quotation mark that is *part* of an argument with a backslash, and that we precede with another backslash a backslash that precedes a quotation mark which itself actually terminates the argument and is not included as part of that argument4. So, if we follow our simplistic approach above and use this as our command line:

```

child.exe argument1 "she said, "you had me at hello""  "\some\path with\spaces"

```

then the child sees:

```

0: [child.exe]
1: [argument1]
2: [she said, you]
3: [had]
4: [me]
5: [at]
6: [hello]
7: [\some\path with\spaces]

```

We don’t want that either! The problem becomes more insidious when quotes are unbalanced:

```

child.exe argument1 "argument"2" argument3 argument4
0: [child.exe]
1: [argument1]
2: [argument2 argument3 argument4]

```

Arguments ending with backslashes also lead to undesired interpretations:

```

child.exe "\some\directory with\spaces\" argument2

0: [child.exe]
1: [\some\directory with\spaces" argument2]

```

Many popular programs (including command shells, the authors of which really should know better) use this simple approach. Developers test only with simple argument strings, leaving users confused and puzzled when their command lines are occasionally mangled.

# The correct solution

We’ve seen that properly quoting an arbitrary command line argument is non-trivial, and that doing it incorrectly causes subtle and maddening problems. The function below properly quotes an argument; translate it into your language and coding style of choice.

```

void
ArgvQuote (
    const std::wstring& Argument,
    std::wstring& CommandLine,
    bool Force
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine appends the given argument to a command line such
    that CommandLineToArgvW will return the argument string unchanged.
    Arguments in a command line should be separated by spaces; this
    function does not add these spaces.

Arguments:

    Argument - Supplies the argument to encode.

    CommandLine - Supplies the command line to which we append the encoded argument string.

    Force - Supplies an indication of whether we should quote
            the argument even if it does not contain any characters that would
            ordinarily require quoting.

Return Value:

    None.

Environment:

    Arbitrary.

--*/

{
    //
    // Unless we're told otherwise, don't quote unless we actually
    // need to do so --- hopefully avoid problems if programs won't
    // parse quotes properly
    //

    if (Force == false &&
        Argument.empty () == false &&
        Argument.find_first_of (L" \t\n\v\"") == Argument.npos)
    {
        CommandLine.append (Argument);
    }
    else {
        CommandLine.push_back (L'"');

        for (auto It = Argument.begin () ; ; ++It) {
            unsigned NumberBackslashes = 0;

            while (It != Argument.end () && *It == L'\\') {
                ++It;
                ++NumberBackslashes;

                break;
            }
            else if (*It == L'"') {

                //
                // Escape all backslashes and the following
                // double quotation mark.
                //

                CommandLine.append (NumberBackslashes * 2 + 1, L'\\');
                CommandLine.push_back (*It);
            }
            else {

                //
                // Backslashes aren't special here.
                //

                CommandLine.append (NumberBackslashes, L'\\');
                CommandLine.push_back (*It);
            }
        }

        CommandLine.push_back (L'"');
    }
}

```

To construct a command line string for a program from arbitrary arguments, we encode each argument (including the program name) with the above function and follow all but the last with a single space. We can then pass the resulting string as the lpCommandLine parameter to [CreateProcess](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) and be confident that the child process will decode each argument to exactly the arguments we were initially given.

# cmd.exe

One might conclude that we’re done: after all, we now understand how to send arbitrary strings through CreateProcess so that they emerge unchanged on the other side — but life is not that simple. Often, we can’t directly supply our command line CreateProcess, but instead must pass it through a level of indirection before reaching our intended child process. The most common indirection is a trip trough the venerable [cmd.exe](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490880.aspx), which we encounter when we use the [system](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/277bwbdz.aspx) function, construct a script for later execution, write a makefile for [nmake](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/http%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2kzfk8c7.aspx), and do many other things. Because the quoting rules for CommandLineToArgvWcmd’s differ from those of cmd, we cannot give a command line intended for the former to the latter and and expect our arguments to survive the trip. Because this difference is subtle, it’s easy to forget about it and leave latent bugs in programs that interact with cmd.

cmd is essentially a text preprocessor: given a command line, it makes a series of textual transformations, then hands the transformed command line to CreateProcess. Some transformations replace environment variable names with their values. Some transformations, such as IO redirection, have useful side effects. Some transformations, such as those triggered by the &, ||, && operators, split command lines into several parts. It’s important to note that cmd doesn’t know or care about command line *arguments* per se: to cmd, the world is made up of whole command lines. Like the post office delivering postcards, cmd doesn’t try to understand what is handles: it merely does its limited job (via these transformations), then leaves it another program to figure out what the final command line means.

All of cmd’s transformations are triggered by the presence of one of the *metacharacters* `(, ), %, !, ^, ", <, >, &,` and `|`. `"` is particularly interesting: when cmd is transforming a command line and sees a `"`, it copies a `"` to the new command line, then begins copying characters from the old command line to the new one without seeing whether any of these characters is a metacharacter. This copying continues until cmd either reaches the end of the command line, runs into a variable substitution, or sees another `"`. In the last case, cmd copies a `"` to the new command line and resumes normal processing. This behavior is *almost*, but not *quite* like what CommandLineFromArgvW does with the same character4; the difference is that cmd does not know about the `\"` sequence and begins interpreting metacharacters earlier than we would expect. It should be apparent why the commands below produce the indicated output:

```

C:\> child "hello world" >\\.\nul

C:\> child "hello"world" >\\.\nul
0: [child]
1: [helloworld >\\.\nul]

C:\> child "hello\"world" >\\.\nul
0: [child]
1: [hello"world]
2: [>\\.\nul]

C:\>

```

If we relying on cmd’s `"`-behavior to protect arguments, quotation marks will produce unexpected behavior. If we pass untrusted data as command line parameters, then the bugs caused by this convention mismatch become a **security issues**:

```

C:\> child "malicious argument\"&whoami"
0: [child]
1: [malicious-argument"]
ntdev\dancol

```

Here, cmd is interpreting the `&` metacharacter as a command separator because, from its point of view, the `&` character lies outside the quoted region. whoami, of course, can be replaced by any number of harmful commands. Note that this command is properly formatted for use with CreateProcess: it’s the passing through cmd that causes trouble.

## A better method of quoting

While the `"` metacharacter cannot fully protect metacharacters in our command lines against unintended shell interpretation, the `^` metacharacter can. When cmd transforms a command line and sees a `^`, it ignores the `^` character itself and copies the next character to the new command line literally, metacharacter or not. That’s why `^` works as the line continuation character: it tells cmd to copy a subsequent newline as itself instead of regarding that newline as a command terminator. If we prefix with `^` every metacharacter in an argument string, cmd will transform that string into the one we mean to use.

```

C:\> child ^"malicious argument\^"^&whoami^"
0: [child]
1: [malicious argument"&whoami]

```

It’s important to also `^`-escape `"` characters: otherwise, cmd would literally copy `^` characters appearing between `"` pairs, mangling the argument string in the process:

```

C:\> child "malicious-argument\^"^&whoami"
0: [child]
1: [malicious-argument\^&whoami]

```

In effect, because cmd’s `"` handling is useless for our purposes, we use `^` to tell cmd to not attempt to be smart about quote detection.

# Conclusion

In general, we can safely pass arbitrary command line arguments to programs, provided we take a few basic precautions.

**Do**:

1. Always escape all arguments so that they will be decoded properly by CommandLineToArgvW, perhaps using my ArgvQuote function above.
2. After step 1, then **if and only if** the command line produced will be interpreted by cmd, prefix each shell metacharacter (or each character) with a `^` character.

**Do not**:

1. Simply add quotes around command line argument arguments without any further processing.
2. Allow cmd to ever see an unescaped `"` character.

   your problem is that \_spawnlp() is nothing more than a thin wrapper around CreateProcess(), and CreateProcess() takes the entire command line as one parameter. \_spawnlp() just takes all of the arguments it's been passed, concatenates them all together, and shuttles that off to CreateProcess(). if you pass an argument to \_spawnlp() that contains a space, you will need to escape it yourself. try passing an argv[0] value that has a space in it and don't escape it, you'll see what I mean.

   Does somebody happen to know whether the precent sign (%) is interpreted somehow by GetCommandLineW? For me, passing something like "image%5d.jpg" (with or without the quotes…) gives "image].jpg" (result from GetCommandLineW) – however the argv passed to main is correct.

   Hi,

   i have one issue with the command substitution in Createprocess(). i have a sample command here,

   cd &unixpath2win /dev/fs/C/Users/

   i want this command to work like, it should convert the path into "C:User" and the directory should be changed to that path.

   but when i run this it displays like,

   C:UsersChairman>cd &unixpath2win /dev/fs/C/Users

   C:UsersChairman

   C:Users

   C:UsersChairman>

   It is not changing the directory.

   i don't understand whats going wrong her.

   Anyone suggest the solution

    These lines are suspicious when NumberBackslashes is greater than one:

    // Backslashes aren't special here.

    CommandLine.append (NumberBackslashes, L'\');

    CommandLine.push\_back (\*It);

    For example, there are two backslashes (NumberBackslashes == 2). This code will output three backslashes. Is it the correct escaping? Should not two backslashes be transformed into four backslashes? Thank you.

    For CommandLineToArgvW, a backslash only needs to be escaped if it is followed by another backslash or a double quote (because those are the two recognized escape sequences – any other character preceded by a backslash is just a backslash and the other character. The backslash is not a general escape character like it is inside many programming language string literals.)

    Unfortunately your advice does not work when the path to the child program to be executed contains spaces. There is no way to escape those, or the surrounding quotes, in a way that both bypasses cmd's special quote treatment and succeeds at starting the program.

    I think Peter is write on the last clause – the behavior of \ and \x should be identical, except that in the \x case the builder could \*optionally\* omit doubling of at most \*one\* of the slashes. In other words, legal output for \x can be \\\x (6) or \\x (5).

    As for CyberShadow's comment, CreateProcess lets you specify the application name and command line separately. So presumably, that's how you'd approach that problem.

    Hey guys, the only thing you need to do to handle quoted strings is to double each double quotes!

    If you want to pass the string "Test" (with quotes) you just do it like this: example.exe """Test"""

    And for nested quotes, you make it in steps:

    test"test => example.exe "test""test" => example.exe "example.exe ""test""""test"""

    Surely the correct answer is simply to add a ArgvToCommandLineW function to the Shell API?

    How is it that Microsoft people do not seem to understand that they need to evolve and improve their API over time?

    This all quoting and unquoting is insane and inconsistent.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1701056#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-04-17 21:47:48 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.39 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.93. When running on Windows with enableCmdLineArguments enabled, the CGI Servlet is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to a bug in the way the JRE passes command line arguments to Windows. The CGI Servlet is disabled by default. The CGI option enableCmdLineArguments is disable by default in Tomcat 9.0.x (and will be disabled by default in all versions in response to this vulnerability).

CVE-2019-0232

**Summary

Security Advisory ID : BSA-2019-784

Component : Apache Tomcat

Revision : 1.0: Initial**

When running on Windows with enableCmdLineArguments enabled, the CGI Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.39 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.93 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to a bug in the way the JRE passes command line arguments to Windows. The CGI Servlet is disabled by default. The CGI option enableCmdLineArguments is disable by default in Tomcat 9.0.x (and will be disabled by default in all versions in response to this vulnerability). For a detailed explanation of the JRE behaviour, see Markus Wulftange's blog (<https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2016/02/java-and-command-line-injections-in-windows.html>) and this archived MSDN blog ([https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/twistylittlepassagesallalike/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-command-line-arguments-the-wrong-way/](https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/https%3A//blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/twistylittlepassagesallalike/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-command-line-arguments-the-wrong-way/)).

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 319 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2559985.1).

 **Please note that since the release of the April 2019 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released two Security Alerts for Oracle WebLogic Server:  [CVE-2019-2725 (April 29, 2019)](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2725.html) and  [CVE-2019-2729 (June 18, 2019)](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2729.html). WebLogic Server customers are strongly advised to apply the fixes contained in this Critical Patch Update, which provides the fixes for the previously-released Alerts as well as additional fixes.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 12 new security fixes for the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite.  10 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2019 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2534806.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2534806.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  9 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

[Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), colloquially known as Tomcat Server, is an open-source Java Servlet container developed by a community with the support of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It implements several Java EE specifications, including Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Expression Language (EL), and WebSocket, and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can run.

On April 15, Nightwatch Cybersecurity [published information](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/04/15/upcoming-advisory-for-apache-tomcat-vulnerability-cve-2019-0232/) on [CVE-2019-0232](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0232), a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability involving Apache Tomcat’s Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Servlet. This high severity vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands by abusing an operating system command injection brought about by a Tomcat CGI Servlet input validation error. This blog entry delves deeper into this vulnerability by expounding on what it is, how it can be exploited, and how it can be addressed.

### Understanding CVE-2019-0232

The CGI is a protocol that is used to manage how web servers interact with applications. These applications, called CGI scripts, are used to execute programs external to the Tomcat Java virtual machine (JVM). The CGI Servlet, which is disabled by default, is used to generate command line parameters generated from a query string. However, Tomcat servers running on Windows machines that have the CGI Servlet parameter **enableCmdLineArguments** enabled are vulnerable to remote code execution due to a bug in how the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) passes command line arguments to Windows.

In Apache Tomcat, the file *web.xml* is used to define default values for all web applications loaded into a Tomcat instance. The CGI Servlet is one of the servlets provided as default. This servlet supports the execution of external applications that conform to the CGI specification. Typically, the CGI Servlet is mapped to the URL pattern “/cgi-bin/\*”, meaning any CGI applications that are executed must be present within the web application.

A new process in Windows OS is launched by calling the **CreateProcess()** function, which takes the following command line as a string (the **lpComandLine** parameter to **CreateProcess**):

* **int CreateProcess( ..., lpComandLine, ... )**

In Windows, arguments are not passed separately as an array of strings but rather in a single command-line string. This requires the program to parse the command line itself by extracting the command line string using **GetCommandLine()** API and then parsing the arguments string using **CommandLineArgvW()** helper function.

This is depicted in the flowchart shown below:

> Cmdline = “program.exe hello world”

[![Figure 1. Command line string for Windows](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/04/CVE-2019-0232-1.jpg)](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/04/CVE-2019-0232-1.jpg)

Figure 1. Command line string for Windows

> Argv[0]->program.exe
>
> Argv[1]->hello
>
> Argv[2]->world

The vulnerability occurs due to the improper passing of command line arguments from JRE to Windows.

For Java applications, **ProcessBuilder()** is called before **CreateProcess()** function kicks in. The arguments are then passed to the static method start of **ProcessImpl()**, which is a platform-dependent class. In the Windows implementation of **ProcessImpl()**, the start method calls the private constructor of **ProcessImpl()**, which creates the command line for the **CreateProcess** call.

[![ Figure 2. Command line string for Java apps](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/04/CVE-2019-0232-2.jpg)](/content/dam/trendmicro/global/en/migrated/security-intelligence-migration-spreadsheet/trendlabs-security-intelligence/2019/04/CVE-2019-0232-2.jpg)

Figure 2. Command line string for Java apps

**ProcessImpl()** builds the Cmdline and passes it to the **CreateProcess()** Windows function, after which **CreateProcess()** executes the *.bat* and *.cmd*  files in a *cmd.exe* shell environment.

If the file that is to be run contains a *.bat* or *.cmd* extension, the image to be run then becomes *cmd.exe*, the Windows command prompt. **CreateProcess()** then restarts at Stage 1, with the name of the batch file being passed as the first parameter to *cmd.exe*.

This results in a 'hello.bat …' becoming **'C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c "hello.bat …"**'. Because the quoting rules for **CommandLineToArgvW** differ from those of cmd’s, this means that an additional set of quoting rules would need to be applied to avoid command injection in the command line interpreted by *cmd.exe*.

Since Java (**ProcessImpl()**) does no additional quoting for this implicit *cmd.exe* call promotion on the passed arguments, arguments processed by *cmd.exe* is now used to execute, presenting inherent issues if arguments are not passed to *cmd.exe* properly.

### Argument parsing by *cmd.exe*

We begin with the understanding that cmd is essentially a text preprocessor: Given a command line, it makes a series of textual transformations then hands the transformed command line to **CreateProcess()**.

Some transformations replace environment variable names with their values. Transformations such as those triggered by the &, ||, && operators, split command lines into several parts. All of cmd’s transformations are triggered by the presence of one of the following metacharacters: (, ), %, !, ^, ", <, >, &, and |.

The metacharacter **"** is particularly interesting: When cmd is transforming a command line and sees a **"**, it copies a **"** to the new command line then begins copying characters from the old command line to the new one without seeing whether any of these characters is a metacharacter. This continues until cmd either reaches the end of the command line, runs into a variable substitution, or sees another **"**.

If we rely on cmd’s **"**-behavior to protect arguments, using quotation marks will produce unexpected behavior. By passing untrusted data as command line parameters, the bugs caused by this convention mismatch become a security issue.

Take for example, the following:

> hello.bat “dir \”&whoami”
>
> 0: [hello.bat]
>
> 1: [&dir]

Here, cmd is interpreting the **&** metacharacter as a command separator because, from its point of view, the **&**character lies outside the quoted region. In this scenario, 'whoami’ can be replaced by any number of harmful commands. When running the command shown above with *hello.bat*, we get the following output.

Figure 4. Performing command execution in Apache Tomcat

To successfully perform command injection, we need to add a few parameters and enable CGI Servlet in the *web.xml* file.

Figure 5. Snapshot of web.xml

The Apache Software Foundation has introduced a new parameter, **cmdLineArgumentsDecoded**, in Apache Tomcat CGI Servlet that is designed to address CVE-2019-0232. **cmdLineArgumentsDecoded** is only used when **enableCmdLineArguments** is set to true*.* It defines a regex pattern “[[a-zA-Z0-9\Q-\_.\\/:\E]+]” that individual decoded command line arguments must match or else the request will be rejected. The introduced patch will eliminate the vulnerability that arises from using spaces and double quotes in command line arguments.

### Recommendations and Trend Micro Solutions

Apache Software Foundation recommends that users running Apache Tomcat upgrade their software to the latest versions:

| **Version** | **Recommended Patch** |
| --- | --- |
| Apache Tomcat 9 | Apache Tomcat 9.0.18 or later |
| Apache Tomcat 8 | Apache Tomcat 8.5.40 or later |
| Apache Tomcat 7 | Apache Tomcat 7.0.93 or later |

Furthermore, users should set the CGI Servlet initialization parameter **enableCmdLineArguments** to false to prevent possible exploitation of CVE-2019-0232.

Developers, programmers, and system administrators using Apache Tomcat can also consider multilayered security technology such as  [Trend Micro™ Deep Security™](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud.html) and [Vulnerability Protection](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps.html?cm_mmc=VURL:www.trendmicro.com-_-VURL-_-/us/enterprise/network-security/interscan-web-security/index.html-_-1:1) solutions, which protect user systems from threats that may exploit CVE-2019-0232 via the following Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) rule:

# Remote Code Execution (RCE) in CGI Servlet – Apache Tomcat on Windows – CVE-2019-0232

[April 30, 2019April 30, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/04/30/remote-code-execution-rce-in-cgi-servlet-apache-tomcat-on-windows-cve-2019-0232/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)

## Summary

Apache Tomcat has a vulnerability in the CGI Servlet which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE). This is only exploitable when running on Windows in a non-default configuration in conjunction with batch files.

The vendor released a fix in Tomcat versions 7.0.94, 8.5.40 and 9.0.19. Users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. **CVE-2019-0232** has been assigned to track this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol to allow web servers to execute command line programs / scripts via web requests. This protocol also allows passing of command line arguments to the script or program being executed via URL parameters. The protocol itself is defined in [RFC 3875](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875).

The following CGI request:

* ```
  http://localhost:8080/cgi/test.bat?&dir
  ```

converts to:

* ```
  test.bat &dir
  ```

Apache Tomcat supports execution of CGI scripts / programs in a non-default configuration via [a special CGI servlet](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/master/java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/CGIServlet.java). This servlet also parses URL parameters and translates them into command line arguments. The actual execution of the CGI scripts happens via Java Runtime Environment (JRE)’s **[java.lang.Runtime](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html)** class, **exec**() function.

When CGI support is enabled in Apache Tomcat in Windows, and command line argument passing is enabled, it is possible to cause command injection via parameter interpolation when calling a batch file (\*.bat / \*.cmd). This happens because “cmd.exe” performs interpolation on some special characters before execution which can cause other shell commands to be called. Neither Apache Tomcat or the Windows JRE perform any kind of input validation for these special characters. A partial list of these characters can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb490954%28v%3Dtechnet.10%29#using-multiple-commands-and-conditional-processing-symbols) and [here](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-redirection.html). Additional information about why this issue is specific to the Windows JRE can be found in [this blog post](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2016/02/java-and-command-line-injections-in-windows.html) by Markus Wulftange.

## **Steps To Replicate**

1. Install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in Windows.

2. Download a vulnerable version of Tomcat and extract.

3. Modify the **conf\context.xml** file on line 19, to enable privileged context:

```
<Context privileged="true">
```

4. Modify **conf\web.xml** to enable the CGI Servlet by removing the comments around line 387 as follows and adding the following parameters (**enableCmdLineArguments** is only needed for Tomcat 9):

```
<servlet>
<servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.apache.catalina.servlets.CGIServlet</servlet-class>
<init-param>
  <param-name>cgiPathPrefix</param-name>
  <param-value>WEB-INF/cgi</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
  <param-name>executable</param-name>
  <param-value></param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
  <param-name>enableCmdLineArguments</param-name>
  <param-value>true</param-value>
</init-param>
<load-on-startup>5</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
```

5. Enable the CGI servlet by removing comments around this – you also need to change the URL pattern to match the one in the previous step (“cgi”):

```
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/cgi/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

6. Create a folder for the CGI files:

```
mkdir webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\cgi
```

7. Place the following text into a batch file located in “webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\cgi\test.bat”

```
@echo off
echo Content-Type: text/plain
echo.
echo Hello, World!
```

8. Run Tomcat via the following command:

```
cd bin
catalina run
```

9. Trigger the following URLs and observe the dir command being run:

```
http://localhost:8080/cgi/test.bat?&dir

```

## Additional Notes – Environment Variables and Path

By default, Tomcat doesn’t pass all of the environment variables from the parent process that runs Tomcat itself. That means that if you run “set”, you will not see any environment variables other than those set by Tomcat itself. This also means that you would need to spell out the directory path of the command you are trying to run. However, if the “[**passShellEnvironment**](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)” parameter is set to true, the variables from the parent process will be passed through and you can call any command in PATH as well as view those variables. If the command cannot be found, there will be a error in the console log “XXXX is not recognized as an internal or external command”.

Example of trying to run a command without a full directory including the Tomcat console logs:

![s5](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s5.png?w=700) ![s6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s6.png?w=700)

Examples of running with the parameter being set or spelling out the directory path:

![s8](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s8.png?w=700)![s9.PNG](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s9.png?w=700)

Example of trying to view the environment variables without and with the **passShellEnvironment** parameter being set to “true”:

![s3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s3.png?w=700)

![s2.PNG](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s2.png?w=700)

## Additional Notes – Memory Leaks / Denial of Service

If the command being executed is a long running command, it maybe possible to cause a denial of service or a memory leak. This happens because Tomcat waits for the OS process to complete.

Here is an example of netstat being triggered:

![screen4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/screen4.png?w=700)

## screen3

## Additional Notes – Other Commands and STDERR

The “[**executable**](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)” parameter indicates which executable should be used to run the script. By default, this is set to “perl” with the expectation that the files being executed are Perl scripts. If this is set to empty, then it is possible to execute batch files since those are executed by “cmd.exe”. HOWEVER, it seems that the command interpolation only happens with batch files – if this is set to real program, then command interpolation doesn’t necessary occur and this vulnerability may be not exploitable.

Also, if the command being triggered outputs to STDERR instead of STDOUT, that output doesn’t get piped back to the web request – instead it goes to the Tomcat console log.

Here is an example when “java.exe” is set as the executable parameter and produces output to STDERR:

## Vendor Response

This issue was responsibly reported to the vendor via the EU FOSSA bounty program operated by Intigriti. Vendor analysis indicated that the core cause for this issue has to do with the way the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) interprets command arguments in Windows specifically and doesn’t impact Apache Tomcat when used with other operating systems. The vendor assigned **CVE-2019-0232** to track this issue and provided a fix.

The vendor fix consists of two parts:

* Disabling command line arguments from being passed to the CGI servlet in the default configuration (“**enableCmdLineArguments**” set to “**false**“) for Tomcat 7 and 8  – this was already disabled by default in Tomcat 9.
* Adding a new configuration parameter (“**cmdLineArgumentsDecoded**“) to the default CGI configuration that will be used for input validation if passing of command line arguments is enabled and will be set to the following regular expression (OS specific). Note that if the user changes this parameter, they may become vulnerable again.
  + ```
    Windows - [[a-zA-Z0-9\Q-_.\\/:\E]+]
    ```
  + ```
    Other operating systems - [.*]
    ```

## Affected Versions and Mitigation

Apache Tomcat is only vulnerable to this issue if the following conditions are met:

* Running on Windows
* CGI support is enabled either via the web.xml for a specific web application or the server as whole (see [documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)). This is disabled by default.
* The “**privileged**” setting is set to “**true**” in the Context element. This is “false” by default.
* Tomcat 9 only – **enableCmdLineArguments** is set to “true” (enabled by default in Tomcat 7 and 8)
* The “**executable**” parameter is empty, and the the CGI scripts being executed are batch files (either .bat or .cmd). It is not clear if other commands that use “cmd.exe” are vulnerable as well.

The vendor indicated that the following versions are vulnerable (no information is available on earlier versions):

* Tomcat 9 – versions 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.17 (9.0.18 is not affected)
* Tomcat 8 – versions 8.5.0 to 8.5.39
* Tomcat 7 – versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.93

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the following fixed versions or later:

* Tomcat 9 – version 9.0.19 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_9.0.19) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/4b244d8)
* Tomcat 8 – version 8.5.40 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_8.5.40) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/5bc4e6d)
* Tomcat 7 – version 7.0.94 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_7.0.94) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/7f0221b)

IMPORTANT NOTE: even when running a fixed version, you SHOULD NOT change the “**cmdLineArgumentsDecoded**” configuration parameter to a different value. If you do, your installation may become vulnerable. If an upgrade is not possible, users can apply one of the following mitigations:

* Disable CGI support (it is disabled by default)
* Or set the “**enableCmdLineArguments**” parameter to “**false**“. This setting will disable command line arguments from being passed via the CGI servlet.

## Bounty Information

This report satisfied the requirement of the EU FOSSA bounty program and a bounty has been paid.

   Looks like the issue was a 0day for some time. It took several days to ship a patched version after they published the advisory. 9.0.18 was not released in the end, only 9.0.19 contains the patch.

   By the way, is the original report for EU FOSSA bounty program publicly available?

   The published the advisory before the official release because the patch could be seen in the commit history publicly

   Regarding the original report – that is not available publicly which is why we wrote this advisory instead.

   Thanks

Abstract

   The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a simple interface for running
   external programs, software or gateways under an information server
   in a platform-independent manner.  Currently, the supported
   information servers are HTTP servers.

   The interface has been in use by the World-Wide Web (WWW) since 1993.
   This specification defines the 'current practice' parameters of the
   'CGI/1.1' interface developed and documented at the U.S. National
   Centre for Supercomputing Applications.  This document also defines
   the use of the CGI/1.1 interface on UNIX(R) and other, similar
   systems.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

[1.1](#section-1.1).  Purpose

   The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) [[22](#ref-22 "\"The Common Gateway Interface\"")] allows an HTTP [[1](#ref-1 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0\"")], [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")]
   server and a CGI script to share responsibility for responding to
   client requests.  The client request comprises a Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [[11](#ref-11 "\"Universal Resource Identifiers in WWW: A Unifying Syntax for the Expression of Names and Addresses of Objects on the Network as used in the World-Wide Web\"")], a request method and various ancillary
   information about the request provided by the transport protocol.

   The CGI defines the abstract parameters, known as meta-variables,
   which describe a client's request.  Together with a concrete
   programmer interface this specifies a platform-independent interface
   between the script and the HTTP server.

   The server is responsible for managing connection, data transfer,
   transport and network issues related to the client request, whereas
   the CGI script handles the application issues, such as data access
   and document processing.

[1.2](#section-1.2).  Requirements

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY' and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](/doc/html/bcp14), [RFC 2119](/doc/html/rfc2119) [[3](#ref-3 "\"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirements Levels\"")].

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the 'must' requirements for the protocols it implements.  An
   implementation that satisfies all of the 'must' and all of the
   'should' requirements for its features is said to be 'unconditionally
   compliant'; one that satisfies all of the 'must' requirements but not
   all of the 'should' requirements for its features is said to be
   'conditionally compliant'.

[1.3](#section-1.3).  Specifications

   Not all of the functions and features of the CGI are defined in the
   main part of this specification.  The following phrases are used to
   describe the features that are not specified:

   'system-defined'
      The feature may differ between systems, but must be the same for
      different implementations using the same system.  A system will
      usually identify a class of operating systems.  Some systems are
      defined in [section 7](#section-7) of this document.  New systems may be defined
      by new specifications without revision of this document.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

   'implementation-defined'
      The behaviour of the feature may vary from implementation to
      implementation; a particular implementation must document its
      behaviour.

[1.4](#section-1.4).  Terminology

   This specification uses many terms defined in the HTTP/1.1
   specification [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")]; however, the following terms are used here in a
   sense which may not accord with their definitions in that document,
   or with their common meaning.

   'meta-variable'
      A named parameter which carries information from the server to the
      script.  It is not necessarily a variable in the operating
      system's environment, although that is the most common
      implementation.

   'script'
      The software that is invoked by the server according to this
      interface.  It need not be a standalone program, but could be a
      dynamically-loaded or shared library, or even a subroutine in the
      server.  It might be a set of statements interpreted at run-time,
      as the term 'script' is frequently understood, but that is not a
      requirement and within the context of this specification the term
      has the broader definition stated.

   'server'
      The application program that invokes the script in order to
      service requests from the client.

[2](#section-2).  Notational Conventions and Generic Grammar

[2.1](#section-2.1).  Augmented BNF

   All of the mechanisms specified in this document are described in
   both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) similar to that
   used by [RFC 822](/doc/html/rfc822) [[13](#ref-13 "\"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages\"")].  Unless stated otherwise, the elements are
   case-sensitive.  This augmented BNF contains the following
   constructs:

   name = definition
      The name of a rule and its definition are separated by the equals
      character ('=').  Whitespace is only significant in that
      continuation lines of a definition are indented.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

   "literal"
      Double quotation marks (") surround literal text, except for a
      literal quotation mark, which is surrounded by angle-brackets ('<'
      and '>').

   rule1 | rule2
      Alternative rules are separated by a vertical bar ('|').

   (rule1 rule2 rule3)
      Elements enclosed in parentheses are treated as a single element.

   *rule
      A rule preceded by an asterisk ('*') may have zero or more
      occurrences.  The full form is 'n*m rule' indicating at least n
      and at most m occurrences of the rule.  n and m are optional
      decimal values with default values of 0 and infinity respectively.

   [rule]
      An element enclosed in square brackets ('[' and ']') is optional,
      and is equivalent to '*1 rule'.

   N rule
      A rule preceded by a decimal number represents exactly N
      occurrences of the rule.  It is equivalent to 'N*N rule'.

[2.2](#section-2.2).  Basic Rules

   This specification uses a BNF-like grammar defined in terms of
   characters.  Unlike many specifications which define the bytes
   allowed by a protocol, here each literal in the grammar corresponds
   to the character it represents.  How these characters are represented
   in terms of bits and bytes within a system are either system-defined
   or specified in the particular context.  The single exception is the
   rule 'OCTET', defined below.

   The following rules are used throughout this specification to
   describe basic parsing constructs.

      alpha         = lowalpha | hialpha
      lowalpha      = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" |
                      "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" |
                      "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" |
                      "y" | "z"
      hialpha       = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" |
                      "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" |
                      "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" |
                      "Y" | "Z"

      digit         = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" |
                      "8" | "9"
      alphanum      = alpha | digit
      OCTET         = <any 8-bit byte>
      CHAR          = alpha | digit | separator | "!" | "#" | "$" |
                      "%" | "&" | "'" | "*" | "+" | "-" | "." | "`" |
                      "^" | "_" | "{" | "|" | "}" | "~" | CTL
      CTL           = <any control character>
      SP            = <space character>
      HT            = <horizontal tab character>
      NL            = <newline>
      LWSP          = SP | HT | NL
      separator     = "(" | ")" | "<" | ">" | "@" | "," | ";" | ":" |
                      "\" | <"> | "/" | "[" | "]" | "?" | "=" | "{" |
                      "}" | SP | HT
      token         = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>
      quoted-string = <"> *qdtext <">
      qdtext        = <any CHAR except <"> and CTLs but including LWSP>
      TEXT          = <any printable character>

   Note that newline (NL) need not be a single control character, but
   can be a sequence of control characters.  A system MAY define TEXT to
   be a larger set of characters than <any CHAR excluding CTLs but
   including LWSP>.

[2.3](#section-2.3).  URL Encoding

   Some variables and constructs used here are described as being
   'URL-encoded'.  This encoding is described in [section 2 of RFC 2396](/doc/html/rfc2396#section-2)
   [[2](#ref-2 "\"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) : Generic Syntax\"")].  In a URL-encoded string an escape sequence consists of a
   percent character ("%") followed by two hexadecimal digits, where the
   two hexadecimal digits form an octet.  An escape sequence represents
   the graphic character that has the octet as its code within the
   US-ASCII [[9](#ref-9 "\"Information Systems -- Coded Character Sets -- 7-bit American Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII)\"")] coded character set, if it exists.  Currently there is
   no provision within the URI syntax to identify which character set
   non-ASCII codes represent, so CGI handles this issue on an ad-hoc
   basis.

   Note that some unsafe (reserved) characters may have different
   semantics when encoded.  The definition of which characters are
   unsafe depends on the context; see [section 2 of RFC 2396](/doc/html/rfc2396#section-2) [[2](#ref-2 "\"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) : Generic Syntax\"")], updated
   by [RFC 2732](/doc/html/rfc2732) [[7](#ref-7 "\"Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's\"")], for an authoritative treatment.  These reserved
   characters are generally used to provide syntactic structure to the
   character string, for example as field separators.  In all cases, the
   string is first processed with regard to any reserved characters
   present, and then the resulting data can be URL-decoded by replacing
   "%" escape sequences by their character values.

   To encode a character string, all reserved and forbidden characters
   are replaced by the corresponding "%" escape sequences.  The string
   can then be used in assembling a URI.  The reserved characters will
   vary from context to context, but will always be drawn from this set:

      reserved = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" |
                 "," | "[" | "]"

   The last two characters were added by [RFC 2732](/doc/html/rfc2732) [[7](#ref-7 "\"Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's\"")].  In any
   particular context, a sub-set of these characters will be reserved;
   the other characters from this set MUST NOT be encoded when a string
   is URL-encoded in that context.  Other basic rules used to describe
   URI syntax are:

      hex        = digit | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "a" | "b"
                   | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"
      escaped    = "%" hex hex
      unreserved = alpha | digit | mark
      mark       = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")"

[3](#section-3).  Invoking the Script

[3.1](#section-3.1).  Server Responsibilities

   The server acts as an application gateway.  It receives the request
   from the client, selects a CGI script to handle the request, converts
   the client request to a CGI request, executes the script and converts
   the CGI response into a response for the client.  When processing the
   client request, it is responsible for implementing any protocol or
   transport level authentication and security.  The server MAY also
   function in a 'non-transparent' manner, modifying the request or
   response in order to provide some additional service, such as media
   type transformation or protocol reduction.

   The server MUST perform translations and protocol conversions on the
   client request data required by this specification.  Furthermore, the
   server retains its responsibility to the client to conform to the
   relevant network protocol even if the CGI script fails to conform to
   this specification.

   If the server is applying authentication to the request, then it MUST
   NOT execute the script unless the request passes all defined access
   controls.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

[3.2](#section-3.2).  Script Selection

   The server determines which CGI is script to be executed based on a
   generic-form URI supplied by the client.  This URI includes a
   hierarchical path with components separated by "/".  For any
   particular request, the server will identify all or a leading part of
   this path with an individual script, thus placing the script at a
   particular point in the path hierarchy.  The remainder of the path,
   if any, is a resource or sub-resource identifier to be interpreted by
   the script.

   Information about this split of the path is available to the script
   in the meta-variables, described below.  Support for non-hierarchical
   URI schemes is outside the scope of this specification.

[3.3](#section-3.3).  The Script-URI

   The mapping from client request URI to choice of script is defined by
   the particular server implementation and its configuration.  The
   server may allow the script to be identified with a set of several
   different URI path hierarchies, and therefore is permitted to replace
   the URI by other members of this set during processing and generation
   of the meta-variables.  The server

      1. MAY preserve the URI in the particular client request; or

      2. it MAY select a canonical URI from the set of possible values
         for each script; or

      3. it can implement any other selection of URI from the set.

   From the meta-variables thus generated, a URI, the 'Script-URI', can
   be constructed.  This MUST have the property that if the client had
   accessed this URI instead, then the script would have been executed
   with the same values for the SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO and QUERY_STRING
   meta-variables.  The Script-URI has the structure of a generic URI as
   defined in [section 3 of RFC 2396](/doc/html/rfc2396#section-3) [[2](#ref-2 "\"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) : Generic Syntax\"")], with the exception that object
   parameters and fragment identifiers are not permitted.  The various
   components of the Script-URI are defined by some of the
   meta-variables (see below);

      script-URI = <scheme> "://" <server-name> ":" <server-port>
                   <script-path> <extra-path> "?" <query-string>

   where <scheme> is found from SERVER_PROTOCOL, <server-name>,
   <server-port> and <query-string> are the values of the respective
   meta-variables.  The SCRIPT_NAME and PATH_INFO values, URL-encoded
   with ";", "=" and "?"  reserved, give <script-path> and <extra-path>.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

   See [section 4.1.5](#section-4.1.5) for more information about the PATH_INFO
   meta-variable.

   The scheme and the protocol are not identical as the scheme
   identifies the access method in addition to the application protocol.
   For example, a resource accessed using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [[14](#ref-14 "\"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0\"")] would have a request URI with a scheme of https when using the
   HTTP protocol [[19](#ref-19 "\"HTTP Over TLS\"")].  CGI/1.1 provides no generic means for the script
   to reconstruct this, and therefore the Script-URI as defined includes
   the base protocol used.  However, a script MAY make use of
   scheme-specific meta-variables to better deduce the URI scheme.

   Note that this definition also allows URIs to be constructed which
   would invoke the script with any permitted values for the path-info
   or query-string, by modifying the appropriate components.

[3.4](#section-3.4).  Execution

   The script is invoked in a system-defined manner.  Unless specified
   otherwise, the file containing the script will be invoked as an
   executable program.  The server prepares the CGI request as described
   in [section 4](#section-4); this comprises the request meta-variables (immediately
   available to the script on execution) and request message data.  The
   request data need not be immediately available to the script; the
   script can be executed before all this data has been received by the
   server from the client.  The response from the script is returned to
   the server as described in sections [5](#section-5) and [6](#section-6).

   In the event of an error condition, the server can interrupt or
   terminate script execution at any time and without warning.  That
   could occur, for example, in the event of a transport failure between
   the server and the client; so the script SHOULD be prepared to handle
   abnormal termination.

[4](#section-4).  The CGI Request

   Information about a request comes from two different sources; the
   request meta-variables and any associated message-body.

[4.1](#section-4.1).  Request Meta-Variables

   Meta-variables contain data about the request passed from the server
   to the script, and are accessed by the script in a system-defined
   manner.  Meta-variables are identified by case-insensitive names;
   there cannot be two different variables whose names differ in case
   only.  Here they are shown using a canonical representation of
   capitals plus underscore ("_").  A particular system can define a
   different representation.

                           "REMOTE_USER" | "REQUEST_METHOD" |
                           "SCRIPT_NAME" | "SERVER_NAME" |

      var-name           = token
      extension-var-name = token

   Meta-variables with the same name as a scheme, and names beginning
   with the name of a protocol or scheme (e.g., HTTP_ACCEPT) are also
   defined.  The number and meaning of these variables may change
   independently of this specification.  (See also [section 4.1.18](#section-4.1.18).)

   The server MAY set additional implementation-defined extension meta-
   variables, whose names SHOULD be prefixed with "X_".

   This specification does not distinguish between zero-length (NULL)
   values and missing values.  For example, a script cannot distinguish
   between the two requests <http://host/script> and [http://host/script?](http://host/script)
   as in both cases the QUERY_STRING meta-variable would be NULL.

      meta-variable-value = "" | 1*<TEXT, CHAR or tokens of value>

   An optional meta-variable may be omitted (left unset) if its value is
   NULL.  Meta-variable values MUST be considered case-sensitive except
   as noted otherwise.  The representation of the characters in the
   meta-variables is system-defined; the server MUST convert values to
   that representation.

[4.1.1](#section-4.1.1).  AUTH_TYPE

   The AUTH_TYPE variable identifies any mechanism used by the server to
   authenticate the user.  It contains a case-insensitive value defined
   by the client protocol or server implementation.

   For HTTP, if the client request required authentication for external
   access, then the server MUST set the value of this variable from the
   'auth-scheme' token in the request Authorization header field.

      AUTH_TYPE      = "" | auth-scheme
      auth-scheme    = "Basic" | "Digest" | extension-auth
      extension-auth = token

   HTTP access authentication schemes are described in [RFC 2617](/doc/html/rfc2617) [[5](#ref-5 "\"HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication\"")].

[4.1.2](#section-4.1.2).  CONTENT_LENGTH

   The CONTENT_LENGTH variable contains the size of the message-body
   attached to the request, if any, in decimal number of octets.  If no
   data is attached, then NULL (or unset).

      CONTENT_LENGTH = "" | 1*digit

   The server MUST set this meta-variable if and only if the request is
   accompanied by a message-body entity.  The CONTENT_LENGTH value must
   reflect the length of the message-body after the server has removed
   any transfer-codings or content-codings.

[4.1.3](#section-4.1.3).  CONTENT_TYPE

   If the request includes a message-body, the CONTENT_TYPE variable is
   set to the Internet Media Type [[6](#ref-6 "\"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types\"")] of the message-body.

      CONTENT_TYPE = "" | media-type
      media-type   = type "/" subtype *( ";" parameter )
      type         = token
      subtype      = token
      parameter    = attribute "=" value
      attribute    = token
      value        = token | quoted-string

   The type, subtype and parameter attribute names are not
   case-sensitive.  Parameter values may be case sensitive.  Media types
   and their use in HTTP are described [section 3.7](#section-3.7) of the HTTP/1.1
   specification [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")].

   There is no default value for this variable.  If and only if it is
   unset, then the script MAY attempt to determine the media type from
   the data received.  If the type remains unknown, then the script MAY
   choose to assume a type of application/octet-stream or it may reject
   the request with an error (as described in [section 6.3.3](#section-6.3.3)).

   Each media-type defines a set of optional and mandatory parameters.
   This may include a charset parameter with a case-insensitive value
   defining the coded character set for the message-body.  If the

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

   charset parameter is omitted, then the default value should be
   derived according to whichever of the following rules is the first to
   apply:

      1. There MAY be a system-defined default charset for some
         media-types.

      2. The default for media-types of type "text" is ISO-8859-1 [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")].

      3. Any default defined in the media-type specification.

      4. The default is US-ASCII.

   The server MUST set this meta-variable if an HTTP Content-Type field
   is present in the client request header.  If the server receives a
   request with an attached entity but no Content-Type header field, it
   MAY attempt to determine the correct content type, otherwise it
   should omit this meta-variable.

[4.1.4](#section-4.1.4).  GATEWAY_INTERFACE

   The GATEWAY_INTERFACE variable MUST be set to the dialect of CGI
   being used by the server to communicate with the script.  Syntax:

      GATEWAY_INTERFACE = "CGI" "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit

   Note that the major and minor numbers are treated as separate
   integers and hence each may be incremented higher than a single
   digit.  Thus CGI/2.4 is a lower version than CGI/2.13 which in turn
   is lower than CGI/12.3.  Leading zeros MUST be ignored by the script
   and MUST NOT be generated by the server.

   This document defines the 1.1 version of the CGI interface.

[4.1.5](#section-4.1.5).  PATH_INFO

   The PATH_INFO variable specifies a path to be interpreted by the CGI
   script.  It identifies the resource or sub-resource to be returned by
   the CGI script, and is derived from the portion of the URI path
   hierarchy following the part that identifies the script itself.
   Unlike a URI path, the PATH_INFO is not URL-encoded, and cannot
   contain path-segment parameters.  A PATH_INFO of "/" represents a
   single void path segment.

      PATH_INFO = "" | ( "/" path )
      path      = lsegment *( "/" lsegment )
      lsegment  = *lchar
      lchar     = <any TEXT or CTL except "/">

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

   The value is considered case-sensitive and the server MUST preserve
   the case of the path as presented in the request URI.  The server MAY
   impose restrictions and limitations on what values it permits for
   PATH_INFO, and MAY reject the request with an error if it encounters
   any values considered objectionable.  That MAY include any requests
   that would result in an encoded "/" being decoded into PATH_INFO, as
   this might represent a loss of information to the script.  Similarly,
   treatment of non US-ASCII characters in the path is system-defined.

   URL-encoded, the PATH_INFO string forms the extra-path component of
   the Script-URI (see [section 3.3](#section-3.3)) which follows the SCRIPT_NAME part
   of that path.

[4.1.6](#section-4.1.6).  PATH_TRANSLATED

   The PATH_TRANSLATED variable is derived by taking the PATH_INFO
   value, parsing it as a local URI in its own right, and performing any
   virtual-to-physical translation appropriate to map it onto the
   server's document repository structure.  The set of characters
   permitted in the result is system-defined.

      PATH_TRANSLATED = *<any character>

   This is the file location that would be accessed by a request for

      <scheme> "://" <server-name> ":" <server-port> <extra-path>

   where <scheme> is the scheme for the original client request and
   <extra-path> is a URL-encoded version of PATH_INFO, with ";", "=" and
   "?"  reserved.  For example, a request such as the following:

      [http://somehost.com/cgi-bin/somescript/this%2eis%2epath%3binfo](http://somehost.com/cgi-bin/somescript/this.is.path%3Binfo)

   would result in a PATH_INFO value of

      /this.is.the.path;info

   An internal URI is constructed from the scheme, server location and
   the URL-encoded PATH_INFO:

      [http://somehost.com/this.is.the.path%3binfo](http://somehost.com/this.is.the.path%3Binfo)

   This would then be translated to a location in the server's document
   repository, perhaps a filesystem path something like this:

      /usr/local/www/htdocs/this.is.the.path;info

   The value of PATH_TRANSLATED is the result of the translation.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

   The value is derived in this way irrespective of whether it maps to a
   valid repository location.  The server MUST preserve the case of the
   extra-path segment unless the underlying repository supports case-
   insensitive names.  If the repository is only case-aware, case-
   preserving, or case-blind with regard to document names, the server
   is not required to preserve the case of the original segment through
   the translation.

   The translation algorithm the server uses to derive PATH_TRANSLATED
   is implementation-defined; CGI scripts which use this variable may
   suffer limited portability.

   The server SHOULD set this meta-variable if the request URI includes
   a path-info component.  If PATH_INFO is NULL, then the
   PATH_TRANSLATED variable MUST be set to NULL (or unset).

[4.1.7](#section-4.1.7).  QUERY_STRING

   The QUERY_STRING variable contains a URL-encoded search or parameter
   string; it provides information to the CGI script to affect or refine
   the document to be returned by the script.

   The URL syntax for a search string is described in section 3 of [RFC](/doc/html/rfc2396)
   [2396](/doc/html/rfc2396) [[2](#ref-2 "\"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) : Generic Syntax\"")].  The QUERY_STRING value is case-sensitive.

      QUERY_STRING = query-string
      query-string = *uric
      uric         = reserved | unreserved | escaped

   When parsing and decoding the query string, the details of the
   parsing, reserved characters and support for non US-ASCII characters
   depends on the context.  For example, form submission from an HTML
   document [[18](#ref-18 "\"HTML 4.01 Specification\"")] uses application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding, in
   which the characters "+", "&" and "=" are reserved, and the ISO
   8859-1 encoding may be used for non US-ASCII characters.

   The QUERY_STRING value provides the query-string part of the
   Script-URI.  (See [section 3.3](#section-3.3)).

   The server MUST set this variable; if the Script-URI does not include
   a query component, the QUERY_STRING MUST be defined as an empty
   string ("").

[4.1.8](#section-4.1.8).  REMOTE_ADDR

   The REMOTE_ADDR variable MUST be set to the network address of the
   client sending the request to the server.

      REMOTE_ADDR  = hostnumber
      hostnumber   = ipv4-address | ipv6-address
      ipv4-address = 1*3digit "." 1*3digit "." 1*3digit "." 1*3digit
      ipv6-address = hexpart [ ":" ipv4-address ]
      hexpart      = hexseq | ( [ hexseq ] "::" [ hexseq ] )
      hexseq       = 1*4hex *( ":" 1*4hex )

   The format of an IPv6 address is described in [RFC 3513](/doc/html/rfc3513) [[15](#ref-15 "\"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture\"")].

[4.1.9](#section-4.1.9).  REMOTE_HOST

   The REMOTE_HOST variable contains the fully qualified domain name of
   the client sending the request to the server, if available, otherwise
   NULL.  Fully qualified domain names take the form as described in
   [section 3.5 of RFC 1034](/doc/html/rfc1034#section-3.5) [[17](#ref-17 "\"Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities\"")] and [section 2.1 of RFC 1123](/doc/html/rfc1123#section-2.1) [[12](#ref-12 "\"Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support\"")].
   Domain names are not case sensitive.

      REMOTE_HOST   = "" | hostname | hostnumber
      hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
      domainlabel   = alphanum [ *alphahypdigit alphanum ]
      toplabel      = alpha [ *alphahypdigit alphanum ]
      alphahypdigit = alphanum | "-"

   The server SHOULD set this variable.  If the hostname is not
   available for performance reasons or otherwise, the server MAY
   substitute the REMOTE_ADDR value.

[4.1.10](#section-4.1.10).  REMOTE_IDENT

   The REMOTE_IDENT variable MAY be used to provide identity information
   reported about the connection by an [RFC 1413](/doc/html/rfc1413) [[20](#ref-20 "\"Identification Protocol\"")] request to the
   remote agent, if available.  The server may choose not to support
   this feature, or not to request the data for efficiency reasons, or
   not to return available identity data.

      REMOTE_IDENT = *TEXT

   The data returned may be used for authentication purposes, but the
   level of trust reposed in it should be minimal.

[4.1.11](#section-4.1.11).  REMOTE_USER

   The REMOTE_USER variable provides a user identification string
   supplied by client as part of user authentication.

      REMOTE_USER = *TEXT

   If the client request required HTTP Authentication [[5](#ref-5 "\"HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication\"")] (e.g., the
   AUTH_TYPE meta-variable is set to "Basic" or "Digest"), then the
   value of the REMOTE_USER meta-variable MUST be set to the user-ID
   supplied.

[4.1.12](#section-4.1.12).  REQUEST_METHOD

   The REQUEST_METHOD meta-variable MUST be set to the method which
   should be used by the script to process the request, as described in
   [section 4.3](#section-4.3).

      REQUEST_METHOD   = method
      method           = "GET" | "POST" | "HEAD" | extension-method
      extension-method = "PUT" | "DELETE" | token

   The method is case sensitive.  The HTTP methods are described in
   [section 5.1.1](#section-5.1.1) of the HTTP/1.0 specification [[1](#ref-1 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0\"")] and [section 5.1.1](#section-5.1.1) of
   the HTTP/1.1 specification [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")].

[4.1.13](#section-4.1.13).  SCRIPT_NAME

   The SCRIPT_NAME variable MUST be set to a URI path (not URL-encoded)
   which could identify the CGI script (rather than the script's
   output).  The syntax is the same as for PATH_INFO ([section 4.1.5](#section-4.1.5))

      SCRIPT_NAME = "" | ( "/" path )

   The leading "/" is not part of the path.  It is optional if the path
   is NULL; however, the variable MUST still be set in that case.

   The SCRIPT_NAME string forms some leading part of the path component
   of the Script-URI derived in some implementation-defined manner.  No
   PATH_INFO segment (see [section 4.1.5](#section-4.1.5)) is included in the SCRIPT_NAME
   value.

[4.1.14](#section-4.1.14).  SERVER_NAME

   The SERVER_NAME variable MUST be set to the name of the server host
   to which the client request is directed.  It is a case-insensitive
   hostname or network address.  It forms the host part of the
   Script-URI.

      SERVER_NAME = server-name
      server-name = hostname | ipv4-address | ( "[" ipv6-address "]" )

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

   A deployed server can have more than one possible value for this
   variable, where several HTTP virtual hosts share the same IP address.
   In that case, the server would use the contents of the request's Host
   header field to select the correct virtual host.

[4.1.15](#section-4.1.15).  SERVER_PORT

   The SERVER_PORT variable MUST be set to the TCP/IP port number on
   which this request is received from the client.  This value is used
   in the port part of the Script-URI.

      SERVER_PORT = server-port
      server-port = 1*digit

   Note that this variable MUST be set, even if the port is the default
   port for the scheme and could otherwise be omitted from a URI.

[4.1.16](#section-4.1.16).  SERVER_PROTOCOL

   The SERVER_PROTOCOL variable MUST be set to the name and version of
   the application protocol used for this CGI request.  This MAY differ
   from the protocol version used by the server in its communication
   with the client.

      SERVER_PROTOCOL   = HTTP-Version | "INCLUDED" | extension-version
      HTTP-Version      = "HTTP" "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit
      extension-version = protocol [ "/" 1*digit "." 1*digit ]
      protocol          = token

   Here, 'protocol' defines the syntax of some of the information
   passing between the server and the script (the 'protocol-specific'
   features).  It is not case sensitive and is usually presented in
   upper case.  The protocol is not the same as the scheme part of the
   script URI, which defines the overall access mechanism used by the
   client to communicate with the server.  For example, a request that
   reaches the script with a protocol of "HTTP" may have used an "https"
   scheme.

   A well-known value for SERVER_PROTOCOL which the server MAY use is
   "INCLUDED", which signals that the current document is being included
   as part of a composite document, rather than being the direct target
   of the client request.  The script should treat this as an HTTP/1.0
   request.

[4.1.17](#section-4.1.17).  SERVER_SOFTWARE

   The SERVER_SOFTWARE meta-variable MUST be set to the name and version
   of the information server software making the CGI request (and
   running the gateway).  It SHOULD be the same as the server
   description reported to the client, if any.

      SERVER_SOFTWARE = 1*( product | comment )
      product         = token [ "/" product-version ]
      product-version = token
      comment         = "(" *( ctext | comment ) ")"
      ctext           = <any TEXT excluding "(" and ")">

[4.1.18](#section-4.1.18).  Protocol-Specific Meta-Variables

   The server SHOULD set meta-variables specific to the protocol and
   scheme for the request.  Interpretation of protocol-specific
   variables depends on the protocol version in SERVER_PROTOCOL.  The
   server MAY set a meta-variable with the name of the scheme to a
   non-NULL value if the scheme is not the same as the protocol.  The
   presence of such a variable indicates to a script which scheme is
   used by the request.

   Meta-variables with names beginning with "HTTP_" contain values read
   from the client request header fields, if the protocol used is HTTP.
   The HTTP header field name is converted to upper case, has all
   occurrences of "-" replaced with "_" and has "HTTP_" prepended to
   give the meta-variable name.  The header data can be presented as
   sent by the client, or can be rewritten in ways which do not change
   its semantics.  If multiple header fields with the same field-name
   are received then the server MUST rewrite them as a single value
   having the same semantics.  Similarly, a header field that spans
   multiple lines MUST be merged onto a single line.  The server MUST,
   if necessary, change the representation of the data (for example, the
   character set) to be appropriate for a CGI meta-variable.

   The server is not required to create meta-variables for all the
   header fields that it receives.  In particular, it SHOULD remove any
   header fields carrying authentication information, such as
   'Authorization'; or that are available to the script in other
   variables, such as 'Content-Length' and 'Content-Type'.  The server
   MAY remove header fields that relate solely to client-side
   communication issues, such as 'Connection'.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

[4.2](#section-4.2).  Request Message-Body

   Request data is accessed by the script in a system-defined method;
   unless defined otherwise, this will be by reading the 'standard
   input' file descriptor or file handle.

      Request-Data   = [ request-body ] [ extension-data ]
      request-body   = <CONTENT_LENGTH>OCTET
      extension-data = *OCTET

   A request-body is supplied with the request if the CONTENT_LENGTH is
   not NULL.  The server MUST make at least that many bytes available
   for the script to read.  The server MAY signal an end-of-file
   condition after CONTENT_LENGTH bytes have been read or it MAY supply
   extension data.  Therefore, the script MUST NOT attempt to read more
   than CONTENT_LENGTH bytes, even if more data is available.  However,
   it is not obliged to read any of the data.

   For non-parsed header (NPH) scripts ([section 5](#section-5)), the server SHOULD
   attempt to ensure that the data supplied to the script is precisely
   as supplied by the client and is unaltered by the server.

   As transfer-codings are not supported on the request-body, the server
   MUST remove any such codings from the message-body, and recalculate
   the CONTENT_LENGTH.  If this is not possible (for example, because of
   large buffering requirements), the server SHOULD reject the client
   request.  It MAY also remove content-codings from the message-body.

[4.3](#section-4.3).  Request Methods

   The Request Method, as supplied in the REQUEST_METHOD meta-variable,
   identifies the processing method to be applied by the script in
   producing a response.  The script author can choose to implement the
   methods most appropriate for the particular application.  If the
   script receives a request with a method it does not support it SHOULD
   reject it with an error (see [section 6.3.3](#section-6.3.3)).

[4.3.1](#section-4.3.1).  GET

   The GET method indicates that the script should produce a document
   based on the meta-variable values.  By convention, the GET method is
   'safe' and 'idempotent' and SHOULD NOT have the significance of
   taking an action other than producing a document.

   The meaning of the GET method may be modified and refined by
   protocol-specific meta-variables.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

[4.3.2](#section-4.3.2).  POST

   The POST method is used to request the script perform processing and
   produce a document based on the data in the request message-body, in
   addition to meta-variable values.  A common use is form submission in
   HTML [[18](#ref-18 "\"HTML 4.01 Specification\"")], intended to initiate processing by the script that has a
   permanent affect, such a change in a database.

   The script MUST check the value of the CONTENT_LENGTH variable before
   reading the attached message-body, and SHOULD check the CONTENT_TYPE
   value before processing it.

[4.3.3](#section-4.3.3).  HEAD

   The HEAD method requests the script to do sufficient processing to
   return the response header fields, without providing a response
   message-body.  The script MUST NOT provide a response message-body
   for a HEAD request.  If it does, then the server MUST discard the
   message-body when reading the response from the script.

[4.3.4](#section-4.3.4).  Protocol-Specific Methods

   The script MAY implement any protocol-specific method, such as
   HTTP/1.1 PUT and DELETE; it SHOULD check the value of SERVER_PROTOCOL
   when doing so.

   The server MAY decide that some methods are not appropriate or
   permitted for a script, and may handle the methods itself or return
   an error to the client.

[4.4](#section-4.4).  The Script Command Line

   Some systems support a method for supplying an array of strings to
   the CGI script.  This is only used in the case of an 'indexed' HTTP
   query, which is identified by a 'GET' or 'HEAD' request with a URI
   query string that does not contain any unencoded "=" characters.  For
   such a request, the server SHOULD treat the query-string as a
   search-string and parse it into words, using the rules

      search-string = search-word *( "+" search-word )
      search-word   = 1*schar
      schar         = unreserved | escaped | xreserved
      xreserved     = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "," |
                      "$"

   After parsing, each search-word is URL-decoded, optionally encoded in
   a system-defined manner and then added to the command line argument
   list.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

   If the server cannot create any part of the argument list, then the
   server MUST NOT generate any command line information.  For example,
   the number of arguments may be greater than operating system or
   server limits, or one of the words may not be representable as an
   argument.

   The script SHOULD check to see if the QUERY_STRING value contains an
   unencoded "=" character, and SHOULD NOT use the command line
   arguments if it does.

[5](#section-5).  NPH Scripts

[5.1](#section-5.1).  Identification

   The server MAY support NPH (Non-Parsed Header) scripts; these are
   scripts to which the server passes all responsibility for response
   processing.

   This specification provides no mechanism for an NPH script to be
   identified on the basis of its output data alone.  By convention,
   therefore, any particular script can only ever provide output of one
   type (NPH or CGI) and hence the script itself is described as an 'NPH
   script'.  A server with NPH support MUST provide an implementation-
   defined mechanism for identifying NPH scripts, perhaps based on the
   name or location of the script.

[5.2](#section-5.2).  NPH Response

   There MUST be a system-defined method for the script to send data
   back to the server or client; a script MUST always return some data.
   Unless defined otherwise, this will be the same as for conventional
   CGI scripts.

   Currently, NPH scripts are only defined for HTTP client requests.  An
   (HTTP) NPH script MUST return a complete HTTP response message,
   currently described in [section 6](#section-6) of the HTTP specifications [[1](#ref-1 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0\"")], [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")].
   The script MUST use the SERVER_PROTOCOL variable to determine the
   appropriate format for a response.  It MUST also take account of any
   generic or protocol-specific meta-variables in the request as might
   be mandated by the particular protocol specification.

   The server MUST ensure that the script output is sent to the client
   unmodified.  Note that this requires the script to use the correct
   character set (US-ASCII [[9](#ref-9 "\"Information Systems -- Coded Character Sets -- 7-bit American Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII)\"")] and ISO 8859-1 [[10](#ref-10 "\"Information technology -- 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets -- Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1\"")] for HTTP) in the
   header fields.  The server SHOULD attempt to ensure that the script
   output is sent directly to the client, with minimal internal and no
   transport-visible buffering.

   Unless the implementation defines otherwise, the script MUST NOT
   indicate in its response that the client can send further requests
   over the same connection.

[6](#section-6).  CGI Response

[6.1](#section-6.1).  Response Handling

   A script MUST always provide a non-empty response, and so there is a
   system-defined method for it to send this data back to the server.
   Unless defined otherwise, this will be via the 'standard output' file
   descriptor.

   The script MUST check the REQUEST_METHOD variable when processing the
   request and preparing its response.

   The server MAY implement a timeout period within which data must be
   received from the script.  If a server implementation defines such a
   timeout and receives no data from a script within the timeout period,
   the server MAY terminate the script process.

[6.2](#section-6.2).  Response Types

   The response comprises a message-header and a message-body, separated
   by a blank line.  The message-header contains one or more header
   fields.  The body may be NULL.

      generic-response = 1*header-field NL [ response-body ]

   The script MUST return one of either a document response, a local
   redirect response or a client redirect (with optional document)
   response.  In the response definitions below, the order of header
   fields in a response is not significant (despite appearing so in the
   BNF).  The header fields are defined in [section 6.3](#section-6.3).

      CGI-Response = document-response | local-redir-response |
                     client-redir-response | client-redirdoc-response

[6.2.1](#section-6.2.1).  Document Response

   The CGI script can return a document to the user in a document
   response, with an optional error code indicating the success status
   of the response.

      document-response = Content-Type [ Status ] *other-field NL
                          response-body

   The script MUST return a Content-Type header field.  A Status header
   field is optional, and status 200 'OK' is assumed if it is omitted.
   The server MUST make any appropriate modifications to the script's
   output to ensure that the response to the client complies with the
   response protocol version.

[6.2.2](#section-6.2.2).  Local Redirect Response

   The CGI script can return a URI path and query-string
   ('local-pathquery') for a local resource in a Location header field.
   This indicates to the server that it should reprocess the request
   using the path specified.

      local-redir-response = local-Location NL

   The script MUST NOT return any other header fields or a message-body,
   and the server MUST generate the response that it would have produced
   in response to a request containing the URL

      scheme "://" server-name ":" server-port local-pathquery

[6.2.3](#section-6.2.3).  Client Redirect Response

   The CGI script can return an absolute URI path in a Location header
   field, to indicate to the client that it should reprocess the request
   using the URI specified.

      client-redir-response = client-Location *extension-field NL

   The script MUST not provide any other header fields, except for
   server-defined CGI extension fields.  For an HTTP client request, the
   server MUST generate a 302 'Found' HTTP response message.

[6.2.4](#section-6.2.4).  Client Redirect Response with Document

   The CGI script can return an absolute URI path in a Location header
   field together with an attached document, to indicate to the client
   that it should reprocess the request using the URI specified.

      client-redirdoc-response = client-Location Status Content-Type
                                 *other-field NL response-body

   The Status header field MUST be supplied and MUST contain a status
   value of 302 'Found', or it MAY contain an extension-code, that is,
   another valid status code that means client redirection.  The server
   MUST make any appropriate modifications to the script's output to
   ensure that the response to the client complies with the response
   protocol version.

[6.3](#section-6.3).  Response Header Fields

   The response header fields are either CGI or extension header fields
   to be interpreted by the server, or protocol-specific header fields
   to be included in the response returned to the client.  At least one
   CGI field MUST be supplied; each CGI field MUST NOT appear more than
   once in the response.  The response header fields have the syntax:

      header-field    = CGI-field | other-field
      CGI-field       = Content-Type | Location | Status
      other-field     = protocol-field | extension-field
      protocol-field  = generic-field
      extension-field = generic-field
      generic-field   = field-name ":" [ field-value ] NL
      field-name      = token
      field-value     = *( field-content | LWSP )
      field-content   = *( token | separator | quoted-string )

   The field-name is not case sensitive.  A NULL field value is
   equivalent to a field not being sent.  Note that each header field in
   a CGI-Response MUST be specified on a single line; CGI/1.1 does not
   support continuation lines.  Whitespace is permitted between the ":"
   and the field-value (but not between the field-name and the ":"), and
   also between tokens in the field-value.

[6.3.1](#section-6.3.1).  Content-Type

   The Content-Type response field sets the Internet Media Type [[6](#ref-6 "\"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types\"")] of
   the entity body.

      Content-Type = "Content-Type:" media-type NL

   If an entity body is returned, the script MUST supply a Content-Type
   field in the response.  If it fails to do so, the server SHOULD NOT
   attempt to determine the correct content type.  The value SHOULD be
   sent unmodified to the client, except for any charset parameter
   changes.

   Unless it is otherwise system-defined, the default charset assumed by
   the client for text media-types is ISO-8859-1 if the protocol is HTTP
   and US-ASCII otherwise.  Hence the script SHOULD include a charset
   parameter.  See [section 3.4.1](#section-3.4.1) of the HTTP/1.1 specification [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")] for a
   discussion of this issue.

[6.3.2](#section-6.3.2).  Location

   The Location header field is used to specify to the server that the
   script is returning a reference to a document rather than an actual
   document (see sections [6.2.3](#section-6.2.3) and [6.2.4](#section-6.2.4)).  It is either an absolute
   URI (optionally with a fragment identifier), indicating that the
   client is to fetch the referenced document, or a local URI path
   (optionally with a query string), indicating that the server is to
   fetch the referenced document and return it to the client as the
   response.

      Location        = local-Location | client-Location
      client-Location = "Location:" fragment-URI NL
      local-Location  = "Location:" local-pathquery NL
      fragment-URI    = absoluteURI [ "#" fragment ]
      fragment        = *uric
      local-pathquery = abs-path [ "?" query-string ]
      abs-path        = "/" path-segments
      path-segments   = segment *( "/" segment )
      segment         = *pchar
      pchar           = unreserved | escaped | extra
      extra           = ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","

   The syntax of an absoluteURI is incorporated into this document from
   that specified in [RFC 2396](/doc/html/rfc2396) [[2](#ref-2 "\"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) : Generic Syntax\"")] and [RFC 2732](/doc/html/rfc2732) [[7](#ref-7 "\"Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's\"")].  A valid absoluteURI
   always starts with the name of scheme followed by ":"; scheme names
   start with a letter and continue with alphanumerics, "+", "-" or ".".
   The local URI path and query must be an absolute path, and not a
   relative path or NULL, and hence must start with a "/".

   Note that any message-body attached to the request (such as for a
   POST request) may not be available to the resource that is the target
   of the redirect.

[6.3.3](#section-6.3.3).  Status

   The Status header field contains a 3-digit integer result code that
   indicates the level of success of the script's attempt to handle the
   request.

      Status         = "Status:" status-code SP reason-phrase NL
      status-code    = "200" | "302" | "400" | "501" | extension-code
      extension-code = 3digit
      reason-phrase  = *TEXT

   Status code 200 'OK' indicates success, and is the default value
   assumed for a document response.  Status code 302 'Found' is used
   with a Location header field and response message-body.  Status code

   400 'Bad Request' may be used for an unknown request format, such as
   a missing CONTENT_TYPE.  Status code 501 'Not Implemented' may be
   returned by a script if it receives an unsupported REQUEST_METHOD.

   Other valid status codes are listed in [section 6.1.1](#section-6.1.1) of the HTTP
   specifications [[1](#ref-1 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0\"")], [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")], and also the IANA HTTP Status Code Registry
   [[8](#ref-8 "\"HTTP Status Code Registry\"")] and MAY be used in addition to or instead of the ones listed
   above.  The script SHOULD check the value of SERVER_PROTOCOL before
   using HTTP/1.1 status codes.  The script MAY reject with error 405
   'Method Not Allowed' HTTP/1.1 requests made using a method it does
   not support.

   Note that returning an error status code does not have to mean an
   error condition with the script itself.  For example, a script that
   is invoked as an error handler by the server should return the code
   appropriate to the server's error condition.

   The reason-phrase is a textual description of the error to be
   returned to the client for human consumption.

[6.3.4](#section-6.3.4).  Protocol-Specific Header Fields

   The script MAY return any other header fields that relate to the
   response message defined by the specification for the SERVER_PROTOCOL
   (HTTP/1.0 [[1](#ref-1 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0\"")] or HTTP/1.1 [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")]).  The server MUST translate the header
   data from the CGI header syntax to the HTTP header syntax if these
   differ.  For example, the character sequence for newline (such as
   UNIX's US-ASCII LF) used by CGI scripts may not be the same as that
   used by HTTP (US-ASCII CR followed by LF).

   The script MUST NOT return any header fields that relate to
   client-side communication issues and could affect the server's
   ability to send the response to the client.  The server MAY remove
   any such header fields returned by the client.  It SHOULD resolve any
   conflicts between header fields returned by the script and header
   fields that it would otherwise send itself.

[6.3.5](#section-6.3.5).  Extension Header Fields

   There may be additional implementation-defined CGI header fields,
   whose field names SHOULD begin with "X-CGI-".  The server MAY ignore
   (and delete) any unrecognised header fields with names beginning "X-
   CGI-" that are received from the script.

[6.4](#section-6.4).  Response Message-Body

   The response message-body is an attached document to be returned to
   the client by the server.  The server MUST read all the data provided
   by the script, until the script signals the end of the message-body
   by way of an end-of-file condition.  The message-body SHOULD be sent
   unmodified to the client, except for HEAD requests or any required
   transfer-codings, content-codings or charset conversions.

      response-body = *OCTET

[7](#section-7).  System Specifications

[7.1](#section-7.1).  AmigaDOS

   Meta-Variables
      Meta-variables are passed to the script in identically named
      environment variables.  These are accessed by the DOS library
      routine GetVar().  The flags argument SHOULD be 0.  Case is
      ignored, but upper case is recommended for compatibility with
      case-sensitive systems.

   The current working directory
      The current working directory for the script is set to the
      directory containing the script.

   Character set
      The US-ASCII character set [[9](#ref-9 "\"Information Systems -- Coded Character Sets -- 7-bit American Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII)\"")] is used for the definition of
      meta-variables, header fields and values; the newline (NL)
      sequence is LF; servers SHOULD also accept CR LF as a newline.

[7.2](#section-7.2).  UNIX

   For UNIX compatible operating systems, the following are defined:

   Meta-Variables
      Meta-variables are passed to the script in identically named
      environment variables.  These are accessed by the C library
      routine getenv() or variable environ.

   The command line
      This is accessed using the argc and argv arguments to main().  The
      words have any characters which are 'active' in the Bourne shell
      escaped with a backslash.

   The current working directory
      The current working directory for the script SHOULD be set to the
      directory containing the script.

   Character set
      The US-ASCII character set [[9](#ref-9 "\"Information Systems -- Coded Character Sets -- 7-bit American Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII)\"")], excluding NUL, is used for the
      definition of meta-variables, header fields and CHAR values; TEXT
      values use ISO-8859-1.  The PATH_TRANSLATED value can contain any
      8-bit byte except NUL.  The newline (NL) sequence is LF; servers
      should also accept CR LF as a newline.

[7.3](#section-7.3).  EBCDIC/POSIX

   For POSIX compatible operating systems using the EBCDIC character
   set, the following are defined:

   Meta-Variables
      Meta-variables are passed to the script in identically named
      environment variables.  These are accessed by the C library
      routine getenv().

   The command line
      This is accessed using the argc and argv arguments to main().  The
      words have any characters which are 'active' in the Bourne shell
      escaped with a backslash.

   The current working directory
      The current working directory for the script SHOULD be set to the
      directory containing the script.

   Character set
      The IBM1047 character set [[21](#ref-21 " SE09-8002-01")], excluding NUL, is used for the
      definition of meta-variables, header fields, values, TEXT strings
      and the PATH_TRANSLATED value.  The newline (NL) sequence is LF;
      servers should also accept CR LF as a newline.

   media-type charset default
      The default charset value for text (and other implementation-
      defined) media types is IBM1047.

[8](#section-8).  Implementation

[8.1](#section-8.1).  Recommendations for Servers

   Although the server and the CGI script need not be consistent in
   their handling of URL paths (client URLs and the PATH_INFO data,
   respectively), server authors may wish to impose consistency.  So the
   server implementation should specify its behaviour for the following
   cases:

      1. define any restrictions on allowed path segments, in particular
         whether non-terminal NULL segments are permitted;

Robinson & Coar              Informational                     [Page 29]
```

```

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

      2. define the behaviour for "." or ".." path segments; i.e.,
         whether they are prohibited, treated as ordinary path segments
         or interpreted in accordance with the relative URL
         specification [[2](#ref-2 "\"Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) : Generic Syntax\"")];

      3. define any limits of the implementation, including limits on
         path or search string lengths, and limits on the volume of
         header fields the server will parse.

[8.2](#section-8.2).  Recommendations for Scripts

   If the script does not intend processing the PATH_INFO data, then it
   should reject the request with 404 Not Found if PATH_INFO is not
   NULL.

   If the output of a form is being processed, check that CONTENT_TYPE
   is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" [[18](#ref-18 "\"HTML 4.01 Specification\"")] or "multipart/form-data"
   [[16](#ref-16 "\"Returning Values from Forms: multipart/form-data\"")].  If CONTENT_TYPE is blank, the script can reject the request
   with a 415 'Unsupported Media Type' error, where supported by the
   protocol.

   When parsing PATH_INFO, PATH_TRANSLATED or SCRIPT_NAME the script
   should be careful of void path segments ("//") and special path
   segments ("." and "..").  They should either be removed from the path
   before use in OS system calls, or the request should be rejected with
   404 'Not Found'.

   When returning header fields, the script should try to send the CGI
   header fields as soon as possible, and should send them before any
   HTTP header fields.  This may help reduce the server's memory
   requirements.

   Script authors should be aware that the REMOTE_ADDR and REMOTE_HOST
   meta-variables (see sections [4.1.8](#section-4.1.8) and [4.1.9](#section-4.1.9)) may not identify the
   ultimate source of the request.  They identify the client for the
   immediate request to the server; that client may be a proxy, gateway,
   or other intermediary acting on behalf of the actual source client.

[9](#section-9).  Security Considerations

[9.1](#section-9.1).  Safe Methods

   As discussed in the security considerations of the HTTP
   specifications [[1](#ref-1 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0\"")], [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")], the convention has been established that the
   GET and HEAD methods should be 'safe' and 'idempotent' (repeated
   requests have the same effect as a single request).  See [section 9.1
   of RFC 2616](/doc/html/rfc2616#section-9.1) [[4](#ref-4 "\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1\"")] for a full discussion.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

[9.2](#section-9.2).  Header Fields Containing Sensitive Information

   Some HTTP header fields may carry sensitive information which the
   server should not pass on to the script unless explicitly configured
   to do so.  For example, if the server protects the script by using
   the Basic authentication scheme, then the client will send an
   Authorization header field containing a username and password.  The
   server validates this information and so it should not pass on the
   password via the HTTP_AUTHORIZATION meta-variable without careful
   consideration.  This also applies to the Proxy-Authorization header
   field and the corresponding HTTP_PROXY_AUTHORIZATION meta-variable.

[9.3](#section-9.3).  Data Privacy

   Confidential data in a request should be placed in a message-body as
   part of a POST request, and not placed in the URI or message headers.
   On some systems, the environment used to pass meta-variables to a
   script may be visible to other scripts or users.  In addition, many
   existing servers, proxies and clients will permanently record the URI
   where it might be visible to third parties.

[9.4](#section-9.4).  Information Security Model

   For a client connection using TLS, the security model applies between
   the client and the server, and not between the client and the script.
   It is the server's responsibility to handle the TLS session, and thus
   it is the server which is authenticated to the client, not the CGI
   script.

   This specification provides no mechanism for the script to
   authenticate the server which invoked it.  There is no enforced
   integrity on the CGI request and response messages.

[9.5](#section-9.5).  Script Interference with the Server

   The most common implementation of CGI invokes the script as a child
   process using the same user and group as the server process.  It
   should therefore be ensured that the script cannot interfere with the
   server process, its configuration, documents or log files.

   If the script is executed by calling a function linked in to the
   server software (either at compile-time or run-time) then precautions
   should be taken to protect the core memory of the server, or to
   ensure that untrusted code cannot be executed.

[RFC 3875](/doc/html/rfc3875)                    CGI Version 1.1                 October 2004

[9.6](#section-9.6).  Data Length and Buffering Considerations

   This specification places no limits on the length of the message-body
   presented to the script.  The script should not assume that
   statically allocated buffers of any size are sufficient to contain
   the entire submission at one time.  Use of a fixed length buffer
   without careful overflow checking may result in an attacker
   exploiting 'stack-smashing' or 'stack-overflow' vulnerabilities of
   the operating system.  The script may spool large submissions to disk
   or other buffering media, but a rapid succession of large submissions
   may result in denial of service conditions.  If the CONTENT_LENGTH of
   a message-body is larger than resource considerations allow, scripts
   should respond with an error status appropriate for the protocol
   version; potentially applicable status codes include 503 'Service
   Unavailable' (HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1), 413 'Request Entity Too Large'
   (HTTP/1.1), and 414 'Request-URI Too Large' (HTTP/1.1).

   Similar considerations apply to the server's handling of the CGI
   response from the script.  There is no limit on the length of the
   header or message-body returned by the script; the server should not
   assume that statically allocated buffers of any size are sufficient
   to contain the entire response.

[9.7](#section-9.7).  Stateless Processing

   The stateless nature of the Web makes each script execution and
   resource retrieval independent of all others even when multiple
   requests constitute a single conceptual Web transaction.  Because of
   this, a script should not make any assumptions about the context of
   the user-agent submitting a request.  In particular, scripts should
   examine data obtained from the client and verify that they are valid,
   both in form and content, before allowing them to be used for
   sensitive purposes such as input to other applications, commands, or
   operating system services.  These uses include (but are not limited
   to) system call arguments, database writes, dynamically evaluated
   source code, and input to billing or other secure processes.  It is
   important that applications be protected from invalid input
   regardless of whether the invalidity is the result of user error,
   logic error, or malicious action.

   Authors of scripts involved in multi-request transactions should be
   particularly cautious about validating the state information;
   undesirable effects may result from the substitution of dangerous
   values for portions of the submission which might otherwise be
   presumed safe.  Subversion of this type occurs when alterations are
   made to data from a prior stage of the transaction that were not
   meant to be controlled by the client (e.g., hidden HTML form
   elements, cookies, embedded URLs, etc.).

[9.8](#section-9.8).  Relative Paths

   The server should be careful of ".." path segments in the request
   URI.  These should be removed or resolved in the request URI before
   it is split into the script-path and extra-path.  Alternatively, when
   the extra-path is used to find the PATH_TRANSLATED, care should be
   taken to avoid the path resolution from providing translated paths
   outside an expected path hierarchy.

[9.9](#section-9.9).  Non-parsed Header Output

   If a script returns a non-parsed header output, to be interpreted by
   the client in its native protocol, then the script must address all
   security considerations relating to that protocol.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Additional patches are included in this Critical Patch Update for the following non-exploitable CVEs in this Oracle product family:

* Oracle E-Business Suite Information Discovery
  + Installer (Apache Log4j): CVE-2020-9488.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2749094.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2749094.1).

## Summary

Apache Tomcat has a vulnerability in the CGI Servlet which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE). This is only exploitable when running on Windows in a non-default configuration in conjunction with batch files.

The vendor released a fix in Tomcat versions 7.0.94, 8.5.40 and 9.0.19. Users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. **CVE-2019-0232** has been assigned to track this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol to allow web servers to execute command line programs / scripts via web requests. This protocol also allows passing of command line arguments to the script or program being executed via URL parameters. The protocol itself is defined in [RFC 3875](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875).

The following CGI request:

* ```
  http://localhost:8080/cgi/test.bat?&dir
  ```

converts to:

* ```
  test.bat &dir
  ```

Apache Tomcat supports execution of CGI scripts / programs in a non-default configuration via [a special CGI servlet](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/master/java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/CGIServlet.java). This servlet also parses URL parameters and translates them into command line arguments. The actual execution of the CGI scripts happens via Java Runtime Environment (JRE)’s **[java.lang.Runtime](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html)** class, **exec**() function.

When CGI support is enabled in Apache Tomcat in Windows, and command line argument passing is enabled, it is possible to cause command injection via parameter interpolation when calling a batch file (\*.bat / \*.cmd). This happens because “cmd.exe” performs interpolation on some special characters before execution which can cause other shell commands to be called. Neither Apache Tomcat or the Windows JRE perform any kind of input validation for these special characters. A partial list of these characters can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb490954%28v%3Dtechnet.10%29#using-multiple-commands-and-conditional-processing-symbols) and [here](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-redirection.html). Additional information about why this issue is specific to the Windows JRE can be found in [this blog post](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2016/02/java-and-command-line-injections-in-windows.html) by Markus Wulftange.

## **Steps To Replicate**

1. Install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in Windows.

2. Download a vulnerable version of Tomcat and extract.

3. Modify the **conf\context.xml** file on line 19, to enable privileged context:

```
<Context privileged="true">
```

4. Modify **conf\web.xml** to enable the CGI Servlet by removing the comments around line 387 as follows and adding the following parameters (**enableCmdLineArguments** is only needed for Tomcat 9):

```
<servlet>
<servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.apache.catalina.servlets.CGIServlet</servlet-class>
<init-param>
  <param-name>cgiPathPrefix</param-name>
  <param-value>WEB-INF/cgi</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
  <param-name>executable</param-name>
  <param-value></param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
  <param-name>enableCmdLineArguments</param-name>
  <param-value>true</param-value>
</init-param>
<load-on-startup>5</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
```

5. Enable the CGI servlet by removing comments around this – you also need to change the URL pattern to match the one in the previous step (“cgi”):

```
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/cgi/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

6. Create a folder for the CGI files:

```
mkdir webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\cgi
```

7. Place the following text into a batch file located in “webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\cgi\test.bat”

```
@echo off
echo Content-Type: text/plain
echo.
echo Hello, World!
```

8. Run Tomcat via the following command:

```
cd bin
catalina run
```

9. Trigger the following URLs and observe the dir command being run:

```
http://localhost:8080/cgi/test.bat?&dir

```

## Additional Notes – Environment Variables and Path

By default, Tomcat doesn’t pass all of the environment variables from the parent process that runs Tomcat itself. That means that if you run “set”, you will not see any environment variables other than those set by Tomcat itself. This also means that you would need to spell out the directory path of the command you are trying to run. However, if the “[**passShellEnvironment**](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)” parameter is set to true, the variables from the parent process will be passed through and you can call any command in PATH as well as view those variables. If the command cannot be found, there will be a error in the console log “XXXX is not recognized as an internal or external command”.

Example of trying to run a command without a full directory including the Tomcat console logs:

![s5](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s5.png?w=700) ![s6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s6.png?w=700)

Examples of running with the parameter being set or spelling out the directory path:

![s8](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s8.png?w=700)![s9.PNG](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s9.png?w=700)

Example of trying to view the environment variables without and with the **passShellEnvironment** parameter being set to “true”:

![s3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s3.png?w=700)

![s2.PNG](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s2.png?w=700)

## Additional Notes – Memory Leaks / Denial of Service

If the command being executed is a long running command, it maybe possible to cause a denial of service or a memory leak. This happens because Tomcat waits for the OS process to complete.

Here is an example of netstat being triggered:

![screen4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/screen4.png?w=700)

## screen3

## Additional Notes – Other Commands and STDERR

The “[**executable**](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)” parameter indicates which executable should be used to run the script. By default, this is set to “perl” with the expectation that the files being executed are Perl scripts. If this is set to empty, then it is possible to execute batch files since those are executed by “cmd.exe”. HOWEVER, it seems that the command interpolation only happens with batch files – if this is set to real program, then command interpolation doesn’t necessary occur and this vulnerability may be not exploitable.

Also, if the command being triggered outputs to STDERR instead of STDOUT, that output doesn’t get piped back to the web request – instead it goes to the Tomcat console log.

Here is an example when “java.exe” is set as the executable parameter and produces output to STDERR:

## Vendor Response

This issue was responsibly reported to the vendor via the EU FOSSA bounty program operated by Intigriti. Vendor analysis indicated that the core cause for this issue has to do with the way the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) interprets command arguments in Windows specifically and doesn’t impact Apache Tomcat when used with other operating systems. The vendor assigned **CVE-2019-0232** to track this issue and provided a fix.

The vendor fix consists of two parts:

* Disabling command line arguments from being passed to the CGI servlet in the default configuration (“**enableCmdLineArguments**” set to “**false**“) for Tomcat 7 and 8  – this was already disabled by default in Tomcat 9.
* Adding a new configuration parameter (“**cmdLineArgumentsDecoded**“) to the default CGI configuration that will be used for input validation if passing of command line arguments is enabled and will be set to the following regular expression (OS specific). Note that if the user changes this parameter, they may become vulnerable again.
  + ```
    Windows - [[a-zA-Z0-9\Q-_.\\/:\E]+]
    ```
  + ```
    Other operating systems - [.*]
    ```

## Affected Versions and Mitigation

Apache Tomcat is only vulnerable to this issue if the following conditions are met:

* Running on Windows
* CGI support is enabled either via the web.xml for a specific web application or the server as whole (see [documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)). This is disabled by default.
* The “**privileged**” setting is set to “**true**” in the Context element. This is “false” by default.
* Tomcat 9 only – **enableCmdLineArguments** is set to “true” (enabled by default in Tomcat 7 and 8)
* The “**executable**” parameter is empty, and the the CGI scripts being executed are batch files (either .bat or .cmd). It is not clear if other commands that use “cmd.exe” are vulnerable as well.

The vendor indicated that the following versions are vulnerable (no information is available on earlier versions):

* Tomcat 9 – versions 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.17 (9.0.18 is not affected)
* Tomcat 8 – versions 8.5.0 to 8.5.39
* Tomcat 7 – versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.93

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the following fixed versions or later:

* Tomcat 9 – version 9.0.19 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_9.0.19) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/4b244d8)
* Tomcat 8 – version 8.5.40 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_8.5.40) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/5bc4e6d)
* Tomcat 7 – version 7.0.94 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_7.0.94) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/7f0221b)

IMPORTANT NOTE: even when running a fixed version, you SHOULD NOT change the “**cmdLineArgumentsDecoded**” configuration parameter to a different value. If you do, your installation may become vulnerable. If an upgrade is not possible, users can apply one of the following mitigations:

* Disable CGI support (it is disabled by default)
* Or set the “**enableCmdLineArguments**” parameter to “**false**“. This setting will disable command line arguments from being passed via the CGI servlet.

   Looks like the issue was a 0day for some time. It took several days to ship a patched version after they published the advisory. 9.0.18 was not released in the end, only 9.0.19 contains the patch.

   By the way, is the original report for EU FOSSA bounty program publicly available?

   The published the advisory before the official release because the patch could be seen in the commit history publicly

   Regarding the original report – that is not available publicly which is why we wrote this advisory instead.

   Thanks

* [Security Advisory](security/advisory)
# Synology-SA-19:17 Tomcat

Publish Time: 2019-04-17 17:42:06 UTC+8

Last Updated: 2019-05-30 10:22:12 UTC+8

Severity
Not affected

Status
Resolved

**Abstract**

Since CVE-2019-0232 only affects when Tomcat is deployed on Microsoft Windows, none of the Synology products are affected as Synology Tomcat7 and Tomcat6 are restricted to execute on DiskStation Manager (DSM).

**Affected Products**

| Product | Severity | Fixed Release Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tomcat7 | Not affected | N/A |
| Tomcat6 | Not affected | N/A |

**Mitigation**

None

**Detail**

* CVE-2019-0232
  + Severity: Not affected
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 0.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N)
  + When running on Windows with enableCmdLineArguments enabled, the CGI Servlet in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.39 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.93 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to a bug in the way the JRE passes command line arguments to Windows. The CGI Servlet is disabled by default. The CGI option enableCmdLineArguments is disable by default in Tomcat 9.0.x (and will be disabled by default in all versions in response to this vulnerability). For a detailed explanation of the JRE behaviour, see Markus Wulftange's blog (https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2016/02/java-and-command-line-injections-in-windows.html) and this archived MSDN blog (https://web.archive.org/web/20161228144344/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/twistylittlepassagesallalike/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-command-line-arguments-the-wrong-way/).

### Java and Command Line Injections in Windows

Everyone knows that incorporating user provided fragments into a command line is dangerous and may lead to command injection. That’s why in Java many suggest using *ProcessBuilder* instead where the program’s arguments are supposed to be passed discretely in separate strings.

However, in Windows, processes are created with a single command line string. And since there are different and seemingly confusing parsing rules for different runtime environments, proper quoting seems to be likewise complicated.

This makes Java for Windows still vulnerable to injection of additional arguments and even commands into the command line.

## Windows’ *CreateProcess* Command Lines

In Windows, the main function for creating processes is the [*CreateProcess* function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/ms682425). And in contrast to C API functions like [*execve*](http://linux.die.net/man/2/execve), arguments are not passed separately as an array of strings but in a single command line. On the other side, the [entry point function *WinMain*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/ms633559) expects a single command line argument as well.

This circumstance requires the program to parse the command line itself for extracting the arguments. And although Windows provides a [*CommandLineToArgvW* function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/bb776391) and supports C and C++ API entry point functions where arguments are already parsed by the runtime and passed in a *argc*/*argv* style, the [rules for quoting command line arguments with all their quirks can be quite confusing](http://daviddeley.com/autohotkey/parameters/parameters.htm). And there is no definitive guide on how to quote properly, let alone something like a *ArgvToCommandLineW* function that does it for you. That’s why many do it wrong, as [“Everyone quotes command line arguments the wrong way” by Daniel Colascione](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/twistylittlepassagesallalike/archive/2011/04/23/everyone-quotes-arguments-the-wrong-way.aspx) observes.

You should definitely read the latter two linked pages first to understand the rest of this blog post.

For testing, we’ll use the following Java class, which utilizes *ProcessBuilder* as suggested:

The resulting *CreateProcess* command line can be observed with the [Windows Sysinternals’ Process Monitor](https://technet.microsoft.com/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx). And for how the command line gets parsed, you can use the following program, which prints the results of both the [parsing of C command-line arguments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/a1y7w461) (via the *argv* function parameter) and of the [parsing of C++ command-line arguments](https://msdn.microsoft.com/17w5ykft) (via [*CommandLineToArgvW* function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/bb776391)).

This already produces different and frankly surprising results in some cases:

The last two are remarkable as one additional quotation mark swaps the results of *argv* and *CommandLineToArgvW*.

## Java’s Command Line Generation in Windows

With the knowledge of how *CreateProcess* expects the command line arguments to be quoted, let’s see how Java builds the command line and quotes the arguments for Windows.

If a process is started using *ProcessBuilder*, the arguments are passed to the static method *start* of *ProcessImpl*, which is a platform-dependent class. In the [Windows implementation of *ProcessImpl*](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/windows/classes/java/lang/ProcessImpl.java), the *start* method calls the private constructor of *ProcessImpl*, which creates the command line for the *CreateProcess* call.

In the private constructor of *ProcessImpl*, there are two operational modes: the legacy mode and the strict mode. These are the result of [issues caused by changes to *Runtime.exec*](https://blogs.oracle.com/thejavatutorials/entry/changes_to_runtime_exec_problems). The legacy mode is only performed if there is no *SecurityManager* present and the property *jdk.lang.Process.allowAmbiguousCommands* is not set to *false*.

### The Legacy Mode

In the legacy mode, the first argument (i. e., the program to execute) is quoted if required and then the command line is created using *createCommandLine*.

The *needsEscaping* method checks whether the value is already quoted using *isQuoted* or wraps it in double quotes if it contains certain characters.

The vertification type *VERIFICATION\_LEGACY* passed to *needsEscaping* makes *noQuotesInside* in *isQuoted* being *false*, which would allow quotation marks within the path. It also makes *needsEscaping* test for space and tabulator characters only.

But let’s take a look at the *createCommandLine* method, which creates the command line:

Again, with the verification type *VERIFICATION\_LEGACY* the *needsEscaping* method only returns *true* if it is already wrapped in quotes (regardless of any quotes within the string) or if it is not wrapped in quotes and contains a space or tabulator character (again, regardless of any quotes within the string). If it needs quoting, it is simply wrapped in quotes and a possible trailing backslash is doubled.

Ok, so far, so good. Now let’s recall Daniel Colascione’s conclusion:

> **Do not:**
>
> 1. Simply add quotes around command line argument arguments without any further processing.
> 2. […]

Yes, exactly. This can be exploited to inject additional arguments:

* A value that is *considered to be quoted*:
  + passed argument value: `"arg 1" "arg 2" "arg 3"`
  + quoted argument value: no quoting needed as it’s “already quoted”
  + parsed argument values: ['`arg 1`', '`arg 2`', '`arg 3`']
* A value that is *considered to be not quoted but requires quotes*:
  + passed argument value: `"arg" 1" "arg 2" "arg 3`
  + quoted argument value: `""arg" 1" "arg 2" "arg 3"`
  + parsed argument values: ['`arg 1`', '`arg 2`', '`arg 3`']

### The Strict Mode

In the strict mode, things are a little different.

If the path contains a quote, *getExecutablePath* throws an exception and the *catch* block is executed where *getTokensFromCommand* tries to extract the path.

However, the rather interesting part is that *createCommandLine* is called with a different verification type based on whether *isShellFile* denotes it as a shell file.

But I’ll come back to that later.

With the verification type *VERIFICATION\_WIN32*, *noQuotesInside* is still *false* and both injection examples mentioned above work as well.

However, if *needsEscaping* is called with the verification type *VERIFICATION\_CMD\_BAT*, *noQuotesInside* becomes *true*. And without being able to inject a quote we can’t escape the quoted argument.

## *CreateProcess*’ Silent *cmd.exe* Promotion

Remember the *isShellFile* checked the file name extension for `.cmd` and `.bat`? This is due to the fact that *CreateProcess* executes these files in a *cmd.exe* shell environment:

> […] the decision tree that *CreateProcess* goes through to run an image is as follows:
>
> * […]
> * If the file to run has a `.bat` or `.cmd` extension, the image to be run becomes *Cmd.exe*, the Windows command prompt, and *CreateProcess* restarts at Stage 1. (The name of the batch file is passed as the first parameter to *Cmd.exe*.)
> * […]
>
> — [Windows Internals, 6th edition (Part 1)](https://technet.microsoft.com/bb963901)

That means a '`file.bat …`' becomes '`C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c "file.bat …"`' and an additional set of quoting rules would need to be applied to avoid command injection in the command line interpreted by *cmd.exe*.

However, since Java does no additional quoting for this implicit *cmd.exe* call promotion on the passed arguments, injection is even easier: `&calc&` does not require any quoting and will be interpreted as a separate command by *cmd.exe*.

This works in the legacy mode just like in the strict mode if we make *isShellFile* return *false*, e. g., by adding whitespace to the end of the path, which tricks the *endsWith* check but are ignored by *CreateProcess*.

## Conclusion

Command line parsing in Windows is not consistent and therefore the implementation of proper quoting of command line argument even less. This may allow the injection of additional arguments.

Additionally, since *CreateProcess* implicitly starts `.bat` and `.cmd` in a *cmd.exe* shell environment, even command injection may be possible.

As a sample, Java for Windows fails to properly quote command line arguments. Even with *ProcessBuilder* where arguments are passed as a list of strings:

* Argument injection is possible by providing an argument containing further quoted arguments, e. g., '`"arg 1" "arg 2" "arg 3"`'.* On *cmd.exe* process command lines, a simple '`&calc&`' alone suffices.

Only within the most strictly mode, the *VERIFICATION\_CMD\_BAT* verification type, injection is not possible:

* Legacy mode:
  + *VERIFICATION\_LEGACY*: There is no *SecurityManager* present and *jdk.lang.Process.allowAmbiguousCommands* is not explicitly set to *false* (no default set)
    - allows argument injection
    - allows command injection in *cmd.exe* calls (explicit or implicit)
* Strict mode:
  + *VERIFICATION\_CMD\_BAT*: Most strictly mode, file ends with `.bat` or `.cmd`
    - does not allow argument injection
    - does not allow command injection in *cmd.exe* calls
  + *VERIFICATION\_WIN32*: File does not end with `.bat` or `.cmd`
    - allows argument injection
    - allows command injection in *cmd.exe* calls (explicit or implicit)

However, Java’s check for switching to the *VERIFICATION\_CMD\_BAT* mode can be circumvented by adding whitespace after the `.bat` or `.cmd`.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 219 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2566015.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 37 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  31 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](cpuoct2019verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2019 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2019 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2568292.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2568292.1).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# RCE in CGI Servlet – Apache Tomcat on Windows – CVE-2019-0232

[Original post:
<https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/04/30/remote-code-execution-rce-in-cgi-servlet-apache-tomcat-on-windows-cve-2019-0232/>]

SUMMARY

Apache Tomcat has a vulnerability in the CGI Servlet which can be
exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE). This is only
exploitable when running on Windows in a non-default configuration in
conjunction with batch files. The vendor released a fix in Tomcat
versions 7.0.94, 8.5.40 and 9.0.19. Users are encouraged to upgrade as
soon as possible. CVE-2019-0232 has been assigned to track this issue.

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol to allow web
servers to execute command line programs / scripts via web requests.
This protocol also allows passing of command line arguments to the
script or program being executed via URL parameters. The protocol
itself is defined in RFC 3875.

Apache Tomcat supports execution of CGI scripts / programs in a
non-default configuration via a special CGI servlet. This servlet also
parses URL parameters and translates them into command line arguments.
The actual execution of the CGI scripts happens via Java Runtime
Environment (JRE)’s java.lang.Runtime class, exec() function.

When CGI support is enabled in Apache Tomcat in Windows, and command
line argument passing is enabled, it is possible to cause command
injection via parameter interpolation when calling a batch file (*.bat
/ *.cmd). This happens because “cmd.exe” performs interpolation on
some special characters before execution which can cause other shell
commands to be called. Neither Apache Tomcat or the Windows JRE
perform any kind of input validation for these special characters.

STEPS TO REPLICATE
1. Install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in Windows.
2. Download a vulnerable version of Tomcat and extract.
3. Modify the conf\context.xml file on line 19, to enable privileged context:
<Context privileged="true">

4. Modify conf\web.xml to enable the CGI Servlet by removing the
comments around line 387 as follows and adding the following
parameters (enableCmdLineArguments is only needed for Tomcat 9):
<servlet>
<servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.apache.catalina.servlets.CGIServlet</servlet-class>
<init-param>
  <param-name>cgiPathPrefix</param-name>
  <param-value>WEB-INF/cgi</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
  <param-name>executable</param-name>
  <param-value></param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
  <param-name>enableCmdLineArguments</param-name>
  <param-value>true</param-value>
</init-param>
<load-on-startup>5</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

5. Enable the CGI servlet by removing comments around this – you also
need to change the URL pattern to match the one in the previous step
(“cgi”):
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/cgi/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

6. Create a folder for the CGI files:
mkdir webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\cgi

7. Place the following text into a batch file located in
“webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\cgi\test.bat”
@echo off
echo Content-Type: text/plain
echo.
echo Hello, World!

8. Run Tomcat via the following command:
cd bin
catalina run

9. Trigger the following URLs and observe the dir command being run:
<http://localhost:8080/cgi/test.bat?&dir>

ADDITIONAL NOTES – ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND PATH

By default, Tomcat doesn’t pass all of the environment variables from
the parent process that runs Tomcat itself. That means that if you run
“set”, you will not see any environment variables other than those set
by Tomcat itself. This also means that you would need to spell out the
directory path of the command you are trying to run. However, if the
“passShellEnvironment” parameter is set to true, the variables from
the parent process will be passed through and you can call any command
in PATH as well as view those variables. If the command cannot be
found, there will be a error in the console log “XXXX is not
recognized as an internal or external command”.

ADDITIONAL NOTES – MEMORY LEAKS / DENIAL OF SERVICE

If the command being executed is a long running command, it maybe
possible to cause a denial of service or a memory leak. This happens
because Tomcat waits for the OS process to complete.

ADDITIONAL NOTES – OTHER COMMANDS AND STDERR

The “executable” parameter indicates which executable should be used
to run the script. By default, this is set to “perl” with the
expectation that the files being executed are Perl scripts. If this is
set to empty, then it is possible to execute batch files since those
are executed by “cmd.exe”. HOWEVER, it seems that the command
interpolation only happens with batch files – if this is set to real
program, then command interpolation doesn’t necessary occur and this
vulnerability may be not exploitable.

Also, if the command being triggered outputs to STDERR instead of
STDOUT, that output doesn’t get piped back to the web request –
instead it goes to the Tomcat console log.

VENDOR RESPONSE

This issue was responsibly reported to the vendor via the EU FOSSA
bounty program operated by Intigriti. Vendor analysis indicated that
the core cause for this issue has to do with the way the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) interprets command arguments in Windows specifically
and doesn’t impact Apache Tomcat when used with other operating
systems. The vendor assigned CVE-2019-0232 to track this issue and
provided a fix.

The vendor fix consists of two parts:
* Disabling command line arguments from being passed to the CGI
servlet in the default configuration (“enableCmdLineArguments” set to
“false“) for Tomcat 7 and 8  – this was already disabled by default in
Tomcat 9.
* Adding a new configuration parameter (“cmdLineArgumentsDecoded“) to
the default CGI configuration that will be used for input validation
if passing of command line arguments is enabled and will be set to the
following regular expression (OS specific). Note that if the user
changes this parameter, they may become vulnerable again.
*** Windows - [[a-zA-Z0-9\Q-_.\\/:\E]+]
*** Other operating systems - [.*]

AFFECTED VERSIONS AND MITIGATION

Apache Tomcat is only vulnerable to this issue if the following
conditions are met:
* Running on Windows
* CGI support is enabled either via the web.xml for a specific web
application or the server as whole (see documentation). This is
disabled by default.
* The “privileged” setting is set to “true” in the Context element.
This is “false” by default.
* Tomcat 9 only – enableCmdLineArguments is set to “true” (enabled by
default in Tomcat 7 and 8)
* The “executable” parameter is empty, and the the CGI scripts being
executed are batch files (either .bat or .cmd). It is not clear if
other commands that use “cmd.exe” are vulnerable as well.

The vendor indicated that the following versions are vulnerable (no
information is available on earlier versions):
* Tomcat 9 – versions 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.17 (9.0.18 is not affected)
* Tomcat 8 – versions 8.5.0 to 8.5.39
* Tomcat 7 – versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.93

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the following fixed versions or later:
* Tomcat 9 – version 9.0.19 – details and code commit
* Tomcat 8 – version 8.5.40 – details and code commit
* Tomcat 7 – version 7.0.94 – details and code commit

IMPORTANT NOTE: even when running a fixed version, you SHOULD NOT
change the “cmdLineArgumentsDecoded” configuration parameter to a
different value. If you do, your installation may become vulnerable.

If an upgrade is not possible, users can apply one of the following mitigations:
* Disable CGI support (it is disabled by default)
* Or set the “enableCmdLineArguments” parameter to “false”. This
setting will disable command line arguments from being passed via the
CGI servlet.

BOUNTY INFORMATION

This report satisfied the requirement of the EU FOSSA bounty program
and a bounty has been paid.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

# Remote Code Execution (RCE) in CGI Servlet – Apache Tomcat on Windows – CVE-2019-0232

[April 30, 2019April 30, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/04/30/remote-code-execution-rce-in-cgi-servlet-apache-tomcat-on-windows-cve-2019-0232/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)

## Summary

Apache Tomcat has a vulnerability in the CGI Servlet which can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE). This is only exploitable when running on Windows in a non-default configuration in conjunction with batch files.

The vendor released a fix in Tomcat versions 7.0.94, 8.5.40 and 9.0.19. Users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. **CVE-2019-0232** has been assigned to track this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol to allow web servers to execute command line programs / scripts via web requests. This protocol also allows passing of command line arguments to the script or program being executed via URL parameters. The protocol itself is defined in [RFC 3875](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875).

The following CGI request:

* ```
  http://localhost:8080/cgi/test.bat?&dir
  ```

converts to:

* ```
  test.bat &dir
  ```

Apache Tomcat supports execution of CGI scripts / programs in a non-default configuration via [a special CGI servlet](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/master/java/org/apache/catalina/servlets/CGIServlet.java). This servlet also parses URL parameters and translates them into command line arguments. The actual execution of the CGI scripts happens via Java Runtime Environment (JRE)’s **[java.lang.Runtime](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html)** class, **exec**() function.

When CGI support is enabled in Apache Tomcat in Windows, and command line argument passing is enabled, it is possible to cause command injection via parameter interpolation when calling a batch file (\*.bat / \*.cmd). This happens because “cmd.exe” performs interpolation on some special characters before execution which can cause other shell commands to be called. Neither Apache Tomcat or the Windows JRE perform any kind of input validation for these special characters. A partial list of these characters can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb490954%28v%3Dtechnet.10%29#using-multiple-commands-and-conditional-processing-symbols) and [here](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-redirection.html). Additional information about why this issue is specific to the Windows JRE can be found in [this blog post](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2016/02/java-and-command-line-injections-in-windows.html) by Markus Wulftange.

## **Steps To Replicate**

1. Install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in Windows.

2. Download a vulnerable version of Tomcat and extract.

3. Modify the **conf\context.xml** file on line 19, to enable privileged context:

```
<Context privileged="true">
```

4. Modify **conf\web.xml** to enable the CGI Servlet by removing the comments around line 387 as follows and adding the following parameters (**enableCmdLineArguments** is only needed for Tomcat 9):

```
<servlet>
<servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>org.apache.catalina.servlets.CGIServlet</servlet-class>
<init-param>
  <param-name>cgiPathPrefix</param-name>
  <param-value>WEB-INF/cgi</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
  <param-name>executable</param-name>
  <param-value></param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
  <param-name>enableCmdLineArguments</param-name>
  <param-value>true</param-value>
</init-param>
<load-on-startup>5</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
```

5. Enable the CGI servlet by removing comments around this – you also need to change the URL pattern to match the one in the previous step (“cgi”):

```
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>cgi</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/cgi/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

6. Create a folder for the CGI files:

```
mkdir webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\cgi
```

7. Place the following text into a batch file located in “webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\cgi\test.bat”

```
@echo off
echo Content-Type: text/plain
echo.
echo Hello, World!
```

8. Run Tomcat via the following command:

```
cd bin
catalina run
```

9. Trigger the following URLs and observe the dir command being run:

```
http://localhost:8080/cgi/test.bat?&dir

```

## Additional Notes – Environment Variables and Path

By default, Tomcat doesn’t pass all of the environment variables from the parent process that runs Tomcat itself. That means that if you run “set”, you will not see any environment variables other than those set by Tomcat itself. This also means that you would need to spell out the directory path of the command you are trying to run. However, if the “[**passShellEnvironment**](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)” parameter is set to true, the variables from the parent process will be passed through and you can call any command in PATH as well as view those variables. If the command cannot be found, there will be a error in the console log “XXXX is not recognized as an internal or external command”.

Example of trying to run a command without a full directory including the Tomcat console logs:

![s5](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s5.png?w=700) ![s6](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s6.png?w=700)

Examples of running with the parameter being set or spelling out the directory path:

![s8](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s8.png?w=700)![s9.PNG](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s9.png?w=700)

Example of trying to view the environment variables without and with the **passShellEnvironment** parameter being set to “true”:

![s3](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s3.png?w=700)

![s2.PNG](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/s2.png?w=700)

## Additional Notes – Memory Leaks / Denial of Service

If the command being executed is a long running command, it maybe possible to cause a denial of service or a memory leak. This happens because Tomcat waits for the OS process to complete.

Here is an example of netstat being triggered:

![screen4](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/screen4.png?w=700)

## screen3

## Additional Notes – Other Commands and STDERR

The “[**executable**](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)” parameter indicates which executable should be used to run the script. By default, this is set to “perl” with the expectation that the files being executed are Perl scripts. If this is set to empty, then it is possible to execute batch files since those are executed by “cmd.exe”. HOWEVER, it seems that the command interpolation only happens with batch files – if this is set to real program, then command interpolation doesn’t necessary occur and this vulnerability may be not exploitable.

Also, if the command being triggered outputs to STDERR instead of STDOUT, that output doesn’t get piped back to the web request – instead it goes to the Tomcat console log.

Here is an example when “java.exe” is set as the executable parameter and produces output to STDERR:

## Vendor Response

This issue was responsibly reported to the vendor via the EU FOSSA bounty program operated by Intigriti. Vendor analysis indicated that the core cause for this issue has to do with the way the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) interprets command arguments in Windows specifically and doesn’t impact Apache Tomcat when used with other operating systems. The vendor assigned **CVE-2019-0232** to track this issue and provided a fix.

The vendor fix consists of two parts:

* Disabling command line arguments from being passed to the CGI servlet in the default configuration (“**enableCmdLineArguments**” set to “**false**“) for Tomcat 7 and 8  – this was already disabled by default in Tomcat 9.
* Adding a new configuration parameter (“**cmdLineArgumentsDecoded**“) to the default CGI configuration that will be used for input validation if passing of command line arguments is enabled and will be set to the following regular expression (OS specific). Note that if the user changes this parameter, they may become vulnerable again.
  + ```
    Windows - [[a-zA-Z0-9\Q-_.\\/:\E]+]
    ```
  + ```
    Other operating systems - [.*]
    ```

## Affected Versions and Mitigation

Apache Tomcat is only vulnerable to this issue if the following conditions are met:

* Running on Windows
* CGI support is enabled either via the web.xml for a specific web application or the server as whole (see [documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/cgi-howto.html)). This is disabled by default.
* The “**privileged**” setting is set to “**true**” in the Context element. This is “false” by default.
* Tomcat 9 only – **enableCmdLineArguments** is set to “true” (enabled by default in Tomcat 7 and 8)
* The “**executable**” parameter is empty, and the the CGI scripts being executed are batch files (either .bat or .cmd). It is not clear if other commands that use “cmd.exe” are vulnerable as well.

The vendor indicated that the following versions are vulnerable (no information is available on earlier versions):

* Tomcat 9 – versions 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.17 (9.0.18 is not affected)
* Tomcat 8 – versions 8.5.0 to 8.5.39
* Tomcat 7 – versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.93

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the following fixed versions or later:

* Tomcat 9 – version 9.0.19 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_9.0.19) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/4b244d8)
* Tomcat 8 – version 8.5.40 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-8.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_8.5.40) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/5bc4e6d)
* Tomcat 7 – version 7.0.94 – [details](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_7.0.94) and [code commit](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/7f0221b)

IMPORTANT NOTE: even when running a fixed version, you SHOULD NOT change the “**cmdLineArgumentsDecoded**” configuration parameter to a different value. If you do, your installation may become vulnerable. If an upgrade is not possible, users can apply one of the following mitigations:

* Disable CGI support (it is disabled by default)
* Or set the “**enableCmdLineArguments**” parameter to “**false**“. This setting will disable command line arguments from being passed via the CGI servlet.

   Looks like the issue was a 0day for some time. It took several days to ship a patched version after they published the advisory. 9.0.18 was not released in the end, only 9.0.19 contains the patch.

   By the way, is the original report for EU FOSSA bounty program publicly available?

   The published the advisory before the official release because the patch could be seen in the commit history publicly

   Regarding the original report – that is not available publicly which is why we wrote this advisory instead.

   Thanks

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2627487.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 23 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  21 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (January 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2613782.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2613782.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 50 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  10 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2602410.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2602410.1).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
