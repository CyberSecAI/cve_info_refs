{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the AppX Deployment Service, which can be abused by creating a hard link to weaken the Access Control List (ACL) of a targeted file.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Abuse of hard links to manipulate file ACLs",
    "Insufficient access control enforcement by the AppX Deployment Service"
  ],
  "Impact": "Local privilege escalation, allowing a low-privileged user to gain 'Full Control' permissions over system-owned files.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation through creation of a hard link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system, ability to create hard links."
