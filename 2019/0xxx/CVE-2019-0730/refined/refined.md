Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-0730:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the LUAFV (LUA File Virtualization) driver, a file system filter driver in Windows. When a file is virtualized (copied to a user's VirtualStore), the driver reuses the original file creation request's `DesiredAccess` parameter. This parameter can include `MAXIMUM_ACCESS`, which grants full access. The vulnerability arises when this captured `DesiredAccess` is used when opening the newly created store file in the VirtualStore. Since the original handle is not updated, it retains the full access, allowing a user to perform actions they would not normally have permissions for, such as writing to a read-only file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The LUAFV driver incorrectly captures and reuses the `DesiredAccess` parameter during the delayed virtualization process.
- **Handle Access Mismatch:** The access rights on the "fake" file handle do not match the actual access rights on the virtualized file in the VirtualStore.
- **Delayed Virtualization Flaw:** The delayed virtualization mechanism allows for the exploitation by creating a hardlink with delete access, which, combined with the full access `DesiredAccess`, permits write operations on the read-only file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A normal user can bypass file system access controls and modify files that they should not have write access to.
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite existing files with arbitrary content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The exploit requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Normal User Account:**  The attacker needs a standard user account on a vulnerable Windows system.
- **Ability to Create Hardlinks:** The attacker must be able to create hardlinks within the file system.
- **Ability to Trigger Virtualization:** The attacker must be able to trigger the delayed virtualization mechanism in the LUAFV driver.

**Exploitation Steps:**
1. Enable virtualization on the token.
2. Open an existing file that meets the virtualization criteria but is not virtualized. Use the `MAXIMUM_ALLOWED | DELETE` access mask with the `FILE_OPEN_IF` disposition.
3. The handle will have `FILE_ALL_ACCESS` granted.
4. Create a target virtualized directory in the user's `LOCALAPPDATA` folder and add a hardlink to a file (the target of the exploit) with the same path as what would be in the virtual store.
5. Trigger virtualization (e.g., using FSCONTROL). The driver will see the target file exists and will try to open it with the requested access rights.
6. Write to the "fake" file handle; this will pass through to the virtual file, allowing the attacker to modify a file they would normally not have write access to.
