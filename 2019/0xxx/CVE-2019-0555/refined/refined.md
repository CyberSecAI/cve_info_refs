Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-0555

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure sharing of the `XmlDocument` class across process boundaries in Windows 10. Specifically, certain partial trust Windows Runtime classes expose an `XmlDocument` object to less privileged callers. This `XmlDocument` object, instead of being properly marshaled, remains in the Runtime Broker process with higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure cross-process sharing:** The `XmlDocument` object is not custom marshaled when passed across process boundaries. It resides in a higher-privileged process (Runtime Broker) even when accessed by a less privileged application.
*   **Exposure of MSXML interfaces:** The Windows Runtime `XmlDocument` object exposes the underlying MSXML interfaces (like `IXMLDOMDocument`, `IPersistMoniker`, `IPersistStream`) that are not intended for direct access in a sandboxed environment.
*   **Abuse of exposed interfaces:** The exposed interfaces, specifically `IXMLDOMDocument`, allow the use of methods such as `save` and `transformNode`. The `transformNode` method can be used to execute XSLT templates, including arbitrary WSH script code, within the higher-privileged Runtime Broker process.
*   **XXE potential:**  The `XmlDocument::loadXML` method with `ResolveExternals` set may enable local file stealing via an XXE attack.
*  **Potential StorageFile Overwrite:** It is theorized the `SaveToFileAsync` function may not be safe due to its use of StorageFile::OpenAsync. If an attacker can get a StorageFile object they should not normally have access to, there is a risk of arbitrary file overwrites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the insecure `XmlDocument` object through the exposed methods, a low-privileged process (e.g., an Edge Content LPAC sandbox) can execute code with the privileges of the Runtime Broker process, effectively escaping the sandbox.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Specifically, the execution of XSLT with embedded WSH script allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Runtime Broker, bypassing sandbox restrictions and allowing full user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local:** This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
*   **Process Boundary Crossing:** The attacker needs to be able to access an `XmlDocument` object exposed by a vulnerable partial trust Windows Runtime class across process boundaries. An example given is `ToastNotificationManager` class, exposed through the `GetTemplateContent` static method, as well as  `ToastNotification`, `BadgeUpdateManager`, and `TileFlyoutUpdateManager`.
*   **XSLT Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious XSLT code that executes a WSH script through the `transformNode` method of the `XmlDocument` object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to access exposed XmlDocument object:** The attacker needs to be able to instantiate/access an `XmlDocument` object from a vulnerable class. The specific example given is within the Edge Content LPAC sandbox, through classes such as `ToastNotificationManager`.
*   **Ability to manipulate XML document:** The attacker needs to be able to call methods on the exposed `XmlDocument` object, in particular `transformNode`.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable classes:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable Windows Runtime classes that expose the `XmlDocument` object and how to access it.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Windows 10 1809 and likely earlier versions.
*   The provided PoC involves injecting a DLL into the MicrosoftEdgeCP process to demonstrate the exploit.
