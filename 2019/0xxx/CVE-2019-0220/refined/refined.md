First, let's analyze the official CVE description:
CVE-2019-0220 Description: "When the path component of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'), directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers processing will implicitly collapse them."

Now, let's analyze each of the provided content blocks.

This document is an Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory for October 2019. It lists many CVEs that are addressed in the update, including CVE-2019-0220. The document provides a table that lists all affected products and versions along with links to the corresponding patch documents. The risk matrices further describe the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it and the potential impact of successful exploits.  Specifically, for CVE-2019-0220, the Oracle Database Server risk matrix states:
"CVE-2019-0220 | Java VM | None | Multiple | Yes | 6.8 | Network | High | None | None | Changed | None | High | None | 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, 18c, 19c"

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inconsistent handling of multiple consecutive slashes in request URLs. Directives like LocationMatch and RewriteRule require handling of duplicate slashes in regular expressions. Other parts of the server implicitly collapses them, leading to inconsistency
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inconsistent URL normalization
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Allows bypassing access control mechanisms and gaining unauthorized access to protected parts of the service.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network based, sending a request with multiple consecutive slashes.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request.

This is a Red Hat Bugzilla entry for bug 1695046, which is a tracking bug for multiple CVEs including CVE-2019-0215, CVE-2019-0217, and CVE-2019-0220 for the httpd package in Fedora. The summary states, "httpd: various flaws [fedora-all]". There are several comments on the page indicating that the fix was pushed to various Fedora releases and that the bug has been closed.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is the same as described in the official CVE description, specifically URL normalization inconsistency.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inconsistent URL normalization.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is that attackers can bypass access control mechanisms.
*    **Attack vectors**: Network based, sending a request with multiple consecutive slashes.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted HTTP request.
