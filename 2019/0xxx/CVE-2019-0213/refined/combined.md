## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

### CVE-2023-28158: Privilege escalation via stored XSS

Privilege escalation via stored XSS using the file upload service to upload malicious content. The issue can be exploited only by authenticated users which can create directory name to inject some XSS content and gain some privileges such admin user.

### CVE-2022-29405: Apache Archiva Arbitrary user password reset vulnerability

### CVE-2021-45105: Apache Log4j2 does not always protect from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation

This may be used by attackers, if users changed the default Archiva log4j2.xml configuration.

### CVE-2021-45046: Apache log4j2 Thread Context Lookup Pattern vulnerable to remote code execution in certain non-default configurations

This may be used by attackers, if users changed the default Archiva log4j2.xml configuration.

### CVE-2021-44228: Apache log4j2 is vulnerable to remote code execution

As mentioned in this CVE Apache log4j2 libraries are vulnerable to remote code execution. Archiva is using log4j2 libraries and is therefore vulnerable to the same scenarios mentioned in this CVE. Attackers may be able to inject statements into the HTTP requests which may be interpreted by the logging library and lead to the download of arbitrary code from remote servers.

### CVE-2020-9495: Apache Archiva login service is vulnerable to LDAP injection

By providing special values to the archiva login form a attacker is able to retrieve user attribute data from the connected LDAP server. With certain characters it is possible to modify the LDAP filter used to query the users on the connected LDAP server. By measuring the response time, arbitrary attribute data can be retrieved from LDAP user objects.

Versions Affected:

* All versions before 2.2.5

Mitigation:

* Upgrade to  [Archiva 2.2.5 or higher](./download.cgi)
### CVE-2019-0213: Apache Archiva XSS may be stored in central UI configuration

It may be possible to store malicious XSS code into central configuration entries, i.e. the logo URL. The vulnerability is considered as minor risk, as only users with admin role can change the configuration, or the communication between the browser and the Archiva server must be compromised.

Versions Affected:

* All versions before 2.2.4

Mitigation:

* Upgrade to  [Archiva 2.2.4 or higher](./download.cgi)
* Make sure, that communication between Archiva server and browser is secure by using TLS and only certain users are assigned to admin role.
### CVE-2019-0214: Apache Archiva arbitrary file write and delete on the server

It is possible to write files to the archiva server at arbitrary locations by using the artifact upload mechanism. Existing files can be overwritten, if the archiva run user has appropriate permission on the filesystem for the target file.

Versions Affected:

* All versions before 2.2.4

Mitigation:

* It is highly recommended to upgrade to  [Archiva 2.2.4 or higher](./download.cgi), where additional validations are implemented to prevent such malicious parameter values.
* As intermediate action you may reduce the number of users that are allowed to upload to archiva and make sure, that the archiva run user may have only write permission to the directories needed.
### CVE-2017-5657: Apache Archiva CSRF vulnerabilities for various REST endpoints

Several REST service endpoints of Apache Archiva are not protected against CSRF attacks. A malicious site opened in the same browser as the archiva site, may send HTML response that performs arbitrary actions on archiva services, with the same rights as the active archiva session (e.g. adminstrator rights).

Versions Affected:

* All versions before 2.2.3

Mitigation:

* Upgrade to  [Archiva 2.2.3 or higher](./download.html), where additional measures are taken to verify the origin of REST requests.
### CVE-2013-2251: Apache Archiva Remote Command Execution

Apache Archiva is affected by a vulnerability in the version of the Struts library being used, which allows a malicious user to run code on the server remotely. More details about the vulnerability can be found at <http://struts.apache.org/release/2.3.x/docs/s2-016.html>.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to Archiva 1.3.6

* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.2 to 1.2.2 are also affected.

All users are recommended to upgrade to  [Archiva 2.0.1 or Archiva 1.3.8](./download.cgi), which are not affected by this issue.

Archiva 2.0.0 and later is not affected by this issue.

### CVE-2013-2187: Apache Archiva Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability

A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to inject arbitrary HTML or Javascript into the Archiva home page.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to Archiva 1.3.6

* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.2 to 1.2.2 are also affected.

All users are recommended to upgrade to  [Archiva 2.0.1 or Archiva 1.3.8](./download.cgi), which are not affected by this issue.

Archiva 2.0.0 and later is not affected by this issue.

### CVE-2010-1870: Struts2 remote commands execution

Apache Archiva is affected by a vulnerability in the version of the Struts library being used, which allows a malicious user to run code on the server remotely. More details about the vulnerability can be found at <http://struts.apache.org/2.2.1/docs/s2-005.html>.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to Archiva 1.3.5

* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.2 to 1.2.2 are also affected.

All users are recommended to upgrade to  [Archiva 1.3.6](./download.cgi), which configures Struts in such a way that it is not affected by this issue.

Archiva 1.4-M3 and later is not affected by this issue.

### CVE-2011-1077: Multiple XSS issues

Apache Archiva is vulnerable to multiple XSS issues, both stored (persistent) and reflected (non-persistent). Javascript which might contain malicious code can be appended in a request parameter or stored as a value in a submitted form, and get executed.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to 1.3.4
* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.0 to 1.2.2 are also affected.
### CVE-2011-1026: Multiple CSRF issues

An attacker can build a simple html page containing a hidden Image tag (eg: `<img src=vulnurl width=0 height=0 /`>) and entice the administrator to access the page.

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to 1.3.4
* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.0 to 1.2.2 are also affected.
### CVE-2011-0533: Apache Archiva cross-site scripting vulnerability

A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to inject arbitrary HTML or Javascript into the Archiva user management page. This fix is available in version  [1.3.4](./download.html) of Apache Archiva. All users must upgrade to this version (or higher).

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to 1.3.3
* The unsupported versions Archiva 1.0 to 1.2.2 are also affected.
### CVE-2010-3449: Apache Archiva CSRF Vulnerability

Apache Archiva doesn't check which form sends credentials. An attacker can create a specially crafted page and force archiva administrators to view it and change their credentials. To fix this, a referrer check was added to the security interceptor for all secured actions. A prompt for the administrator's password when changing a user account was also set in place. This fix is available in version  [1.3.2](./download.html) of Apache Archiva. All users must upgrade to this version (or higher).

Versions Affected:

* Archiva 1.3 to 1.3.1
* Archiva 1.2 to 1.2.2 (end of life)
* Archiva 1.1 to 1.1.4 (end of life)
* Archiva 1.0 to 1.0.3 (end of life)

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
