  "CVE-2019-0816": {
    "description": "A security feature bypass exists in Azure SSH Keypairs, due to a change in the provisioning logic for some Linux images that use cloud-init. The entire list of certificates and public keys exposed from the wireserver is added to the authorized_keys file for the user-to-be-provisioned, regardless of whether they belong to the user or not.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to cloud-init adding all certificates and public keys from the wireserver to the authorized_keys file of the user being provisioned, without verifying if they belong to the user.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of SSH keys",
        "Lack of proper authorization checks"
      ],
      "impact": "Unauthorized users can gain access to the system via SSH by using the extra keys added to the authorized_keys file.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploiting cloud-init's behavior during provisioning in Azure environments."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with access to the wireserver, could inject keys, and achieve unauthorized access.",
