Since cloud-init cannot write the network configuration networking cannot work if there is no default device configuration, such as ifcfg-eth0 built in.  This is independent of the ordering. In 19.2 currently in Cloud:Tools the order of unit files is modified. However this does not fix the issue w.r.t. cloud-init not being able to write the network configuration to begin with. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1142988#c7)  Raymond Finzel   2019-10-22 18:53:38 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/cloud-init/cloud-init/blob/02c8214eac857e29b40ecc65992c1da6983083e1/cloudinit/net/sysconfig.py#L745-L758>  These lines contain directories that don't exist in the cloud image - could be the availability check that's failing.

I think I've tracked the issue down. There was a change here -> <https://github.com/cloud-init/cloud-init/commit/0948cdfbef2052cdf839f24d6a17d457aa9fd4d3#diff-b3309b48873bd17b3fc8f29bd84c50fa> that does not appear to be in the opensuse version. "opensuse-tumbleweed" and "opensuse-leap" (which are returned from the get_linux_distro method) are not in the KNOWN_DISTROS dictionary.

Thanks so much for all your help, and the excellent work you do maintaining this package for opensuse. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1142988#c10)  Raymond Finzel   2019-10-22 20:53:55 UTC  ``` (to be clear I think the change you made shortcircuiting with ifup/ifdown was necessary, especially since those hardcoded paths are still in the most recent commit of cloud-init <https://github.com/cloud-init/cloud-init/blob/02c8214eac857e29b40ecc65992c1da6983083e1/cloudinit/net/sysconfig.py> , it just also needs the changes from that diff) ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1142988#c11)  Robert Schweikert   2019-10-22 20:56:25 UTC  ``` Thanks for spotting this, yes we need another change in the package.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for cloud-init
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2019:2633-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1099358 #1129124 #1136440 #1142988 #1144363
#1151488 #1154092
Cross-References: CVE-2019-0816
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 15.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has 6 fixes is
now available.
Description:
This update for cloud-init to version 19.2 fixes the following issues:
Security issue fixed:
- CVE-2019-0816: Fixed the unnecessary extra ssh keys that were added to
authorized\_keys (bsc#1129124).
Non-security issues fixed:
- Short circuit the conditional for identifying the sysconfig renderer
(bsc#1154092, bsc#1142988).
- If /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink, break it. This will avoid netconfig
from clobbering the changes cloud-init applied (bsc#1151488).
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15-SP1:Update update project.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use the SUSE recommended installation methods
like YaST online\_update or "zypper patch".
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE Leap 15.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2019-2633=1
Package List:
- openSUSE Leap 15.1 (x86\_64):
cloud-init-19.2-lp151.2.9.1
cloud-init-config-suse-19.2-lp151.2.9.1
