Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-0804:

**Root Cause:**
*   The Windows Azure Linux Agent (WALinuxAgent) creates swap files on resource disks with overly permissive file permissions (0644).

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Weak Permissions:** The swap files are readable by "group" and "other" users on the system, leading to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the swap file, which could include system memory data.

**Attack Vector:**
*   Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker must have a local account on the affected system.

**Affected Systems:**
*   Azure virtual machines running Linux that utilize WALinuxAgent with swap files enabled on the ephemeral drive (/mnt).
*   Specific versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and openSUSE Leap.

**Red Hat CVSS Metrics:**
*   CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.5
*   Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**SUSE CVSS Metrics:**
*   CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.0
    *   Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N
*   CVSS v3 Base Score: 5.5
    *   Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

**Mitigation:**
*   Apply the security updates provided by the respective Linux distributions (Red Hat, SUSE, openSUSE).  These updates modify the WALinuxAgent to create swap files with more restrictive permissions.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
*   Local account on the system.
*   Ability to read files on the file system.
