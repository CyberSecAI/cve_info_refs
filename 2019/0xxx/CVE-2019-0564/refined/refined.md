{
  "cve": "CVE-2019-0564",
  "description": "The methods for sending and receiving data on a WebSocket accept a CancellationToken, but previously did not implement actual support for cancellation. Activating the cancellation token would result in a no-op, and would not cancel any in progress operations. This provided a potential avenue for DOS, by tying up connections to a server with WebSocket connections that the server could not cancel.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Kestrel server's WebSocket implementation did not properly support cancellation tokens. When a CancellationToken was activated, it failed to cancel in-progress operations, leading to resource exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of cancellation tokens",
      "Lack of resource management for WebSocket connections"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). By establishing numerous WebSocket connections that cannot be canceled, an attacker can exhaust server resources (like connections or ports), rendering the server unavailable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based exploitation via WebSocket connections."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to establish WebSocket connections with the vulnerable server. No specific authentication or privilege is required to perform the attack."
