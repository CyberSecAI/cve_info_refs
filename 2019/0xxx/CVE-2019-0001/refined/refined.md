Based on the content, here's the information related to CVE-2019-18849 which is referenced within the content:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A crafted email message, when extracted via `tnef`, could potentially lead to an attack.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a security bypass that can be exploited by crafting a specific email message. This message, when processed by the `tnef` utility, can cause the system to unintentionally modify sensitive files such as `.ssh/authorized_keys`.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to modify the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file. This could potentially grant unauthorized access to the system through SSH.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a crafted email with a specific type of MS-TNEF attachment that exploits a vulnerability in the way `tnef` processes the attachment.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted email to a user that will process the email using `tnef`.
