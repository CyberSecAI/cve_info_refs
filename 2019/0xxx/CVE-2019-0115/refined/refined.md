Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-0115:

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation in the Kernel Mode Driver (KMD) module of the Intel Graphics Driver.
*   **Weakness:** The driver does not properly validate input data, which leads to a vulnerability.
*  **Impact:** An authenticated user can potentially cause a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the target machine.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. User interaction is required (UI:R), and the scope of impact is changed (S:C).

**Summary of CVE-2019-0115:**
