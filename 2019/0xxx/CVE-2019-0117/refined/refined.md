Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient access control in the protected memory subsystem for Intel SGX. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how SGX handles memory access related to Intel Processor Graphics.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control within the protected memory subsystem when Intel SGX is used with Intel Processor Graphics. This allows for unauthorized access.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  A privileged user can potentially enable information disclosure through local access. This means that sensitive data within the SGX enclave could be exposed.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access by a privileged user. This means the attacker needs to have elevated privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have a privileged user account on the target system. The attacker also requires local access to the system. The vulnerable system must have an affected Intel processor with Intel SGX and Intel Processor Graphics enabled.

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects a range of Intel processors including 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Generation Intel Core processors, as well as Intel Xeon E3-1500 v5/v6, and E-2100/E-2200 processor families that use Intel Processor Graphics with Intel SGX.

*   **Mitigation:** Intel recommends the following mitigation steps:
    *   Update system BIOS from the provider and Intel SGX platform software.
    *   Disable integrated graphics if it is not needed.
    *   SGX application providers must organize code/data within enclave memory to avoid putting sensitive materials in DWORD0 and DWORD1 of a cache line. Intel is releasing updated SGX SDK with new memory allocation APIs for this purpose.
    *   Increase the Security Version Number of the enclave application to reflect the changes.
