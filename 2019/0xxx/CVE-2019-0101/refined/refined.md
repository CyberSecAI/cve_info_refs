- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authentication bypass in the Intel Unite(R) solution's administrative portal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access to the administrative portal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Escalation of privilege to the Intel Unite(R) Solution administrative portal, potentially leading to unauthorized control and actions within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access by an unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the affected Intel UniteÂ® Solution software server component. No prior authentication is required.
