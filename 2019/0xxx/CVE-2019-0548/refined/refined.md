Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM) which fails to properly handle WebSocket disconnects. Specifically, aborted WebSocket connections were not being correctly detected, leading to an accumulation of open connections between ANCM and Kestrel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is a failure to release resources associated with aborted websocket connections.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By continuously aborting WebSocket connections, an attacker can exhaust the server's internal ports, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation results in the server becoming unresponsive due to resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WebSockets:** The attack vector is through the establishment and subsequent abortion of WebSocket connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish WebSocket connections with the target server.
- **Ability to Abort Connections:** The attacker must be able to intentionally abort established WebSocket connections.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specifically related to the ANCM and its interaction with Kestrel, a web server for ASP.NET Core.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker without requiring user authentication.
- The vulnerability was addressed in .NET Core versions 2.1.5 and 2.2.1, as part of the RHSA-2019:0040 security advisory.
