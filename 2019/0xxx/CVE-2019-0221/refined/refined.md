Based on the provided text, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-0221 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** XSS in SSI printenv command within Apache Tomcat.
*   **Root Cause:** The SSI `printenv` command echoes user-provided data without proper escaping, leading to XSS. The `echo` command, on the other hand, correctly escapes XSS values.
*   **Weakness:** Missing encoding/escaping of output in the `printenv` directive's implementation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious input (cross-site scripting) causing it to output and execute in a user's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a URL with a malicious query string and accessing a vulnerable `.shtml` file, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript into the page, leading to XSS.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access a `.shtml` page where SSI is enabled and the `printenv` directive is present.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input via request attributes.
*   **Conditions for exploitation (per Nightwatch Cybersecurity):**
    1.  SSI support must be enabled in Apache Tomcat (either globally or for a specific web application). It is NOT enabled by default.
    2.  A file with the “printenv” SSI directive must exist within the web application (usually “.shtml”).
    3.  The file must be accessible to the attacker.
*   **Affected Versions:** Tomcat 9 (9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.17), Tomcat 8 (8.5.0 to 8.5.39), and Tomcat 7 (7.0.0 to 7.0.93).
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Tomcat versions 7.0.94, 8.5.40, or 9.0.19 or later, which include the fix. Nightwatch Cybersecurity notes that disabling SSI or avoiding use of the `printenv` directive would also mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **Severity:** Red Hat and Ubuntu consider this an Important security issue. Nightwatch Cybersecurity reports that the vendor (Apache) rated this as a Low severity issue, as SSI is disabled by default and the `printenv` command, intended for debugging, is unlikely to be present in a production system. NetApp rates this as MEDIUM.

The fix involves adding proper encoding to the output of the `printenv` directive.

The Ubuntu Security Notice provides update instructions for affected Ubuntu releases. The Red Hat Security Advisory indicates which Red Hat JBoss Web Server versions are affected and provides a solution.
