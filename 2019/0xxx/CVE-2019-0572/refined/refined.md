{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Data Sharing Service (DSSVC) doesn't handle file hard links properly in the `DSOpenSharedFile` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The service verifies file paths using `GetFinalPathNameByHandle` to prevent symlink attacks. However, this check is bypassed by using hard links. A user can create a hard link to a file they can only read, then when the service opens the file, it opens it with write access due to the hard link.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full write access to arbitrary files accessible by the SYSTEM user, leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local. An attacker with a regular user account on the system can exploit this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create hard links and call the `DSCreateSharedFileToken` and `DSOpenSharedFile` functions."
