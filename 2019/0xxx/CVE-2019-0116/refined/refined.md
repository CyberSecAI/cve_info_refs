Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-0116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read within the Kernel Mode Driver (KMD) module of the Intel Graphics Driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability may allow a privileged user to trigger a DoS condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access. The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least some privileges, though not necessarily the highest level of privileges. The content states a "privileged user" can exploit the vulnerability, but the CVSS vector indicates "Low" privileges are sufficient.
- User interaction may be required (UI:R), depending on the specific conditions.
