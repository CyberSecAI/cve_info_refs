  "CVE-2019-0223": {
    "description": "The TLS support in Apache Qpid Proton 0.9 - 0.27.0 can under some circumstances connect as a client to a TLS server that offers anonymous ciphers irrespective of whether the client was configured to verify the server's certificate or certificate against the hostname used to connect. This means that an undetected man in the middle attack could be constructed if an attacker can arrange to intercept TLS traffic. Versions 0.9 - 0.27.0 are affected when using OpenSSL prior to 1.1.0. This includes the Qpid Proton C library, and all language binding libraries using it. Installations using the native Windows Schannel TLS implementation or using OpenSSL 1.1.0 or later are not affected.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the TLS implementation in Apache Qpid Proton's handling of anonymous ciphers when connecting as a client to a TLS server. Specifically, it can connect to a TLS server that offers anonymous ciphers even if the client is configured to verify the server's certificate or hostname.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of anonymous ciphers in TLS client connections.",
      "Failure to enforce configured certificate verification."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack can intercept TLS traffic undetected. This may result in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of resources.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during a client connection to a TLS server where the server is offering anonymous ciphers and the client is using a vulnerable version of Qpid Proton with an affected OpenSSL version.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept the TLS traffic between the client and server. They do not need prior authentication or knowledge of the credentials since the flaw involves anonymous ciphers."
