[5.4.0](/xtermjs/xterm.js/releases/tag/5.4.0)

📢 The package has been migrated to the `@xterm` scope ([#4860](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4860), [#4861](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4861)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar). This means that the old `xterm` and `xterm-*` packages are now deprecated and will no longer be maintained. This was done mainly for security reasons to remove ambiguity around the package names and to prevent potential typosquatting attacks.

**Please use the new scoped `@xterm/*` packages.**

## 🚀 Features

* The default DOM-based renderer is significantly faster now ([#4605](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4605), [#4631](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4631), [#4651](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4651), [#4662](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4662), [#4681](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4681), [#4754](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4754)) via [@jerch](https://github.com/jerch), [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar), [@PerBothner](https://github.com/PerBothner), [@tisilent](https://github.com/tisilent)

  ```
  const term = new Terminal({
      logger: {
          trace: (e, args) => console.log('trace: ', e, args),

          info: (e, args) => console.log('info: ', e, args),
          warn: (e, args) => console.log('warn: ', e, args),
          error: (e, args) => console.log('error: ', e, args)
      }
  });
  ```

  ```
  const term = new Terminal({
      ignoreBracketedPasteMode: true
  });
  ```
* New `cursorInactiveStyle` option ([#4657](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4657)) via [@tisilent](https://github.com/tisilent)
  ```

      cursorInactiveStyle: 'none'
  });
  ```

## 🚀 Features

**Multiple texture atlas page support** ([#4244](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4244), [#4252](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4252), [#4274](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4274)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

Instead of there being a hard cap of 1024x1024 on the size of the texture atlas backing the canvas and webgl renderers, multiple textures are now supported. Each individual texture is now 512x512 which allows faster uploading to the GPU and will continually merge until the maximum of 4096x4096 is reached.

The benefits in simple terms of this change are:

* Less time from drawing a glyph to rendering it
* Less CPU is used when lots of glyphs are used
* Essentially unlimited space for glyphs, which is good for certain use cases but will also let us explore things like ["perfect" dotted and curvy underlines](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/4060) in the future

Here is an example of a 512x512 texture atlas page right after the terminal has loaded and printed a powerline-based prompt:

And here is the 1024x1024 page after a lot of glyphs have rendered:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/208488767-d272441b-52e4-493c-86bd-f37ced4762f3.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/208488767-d272441b-52e4-493c-86bd-f37ced4762f3.png)

**Slash and triangle custom glyphs** ([#4313](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4313)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

Eight new powerline extra custom glyphs are supported:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/208487399-734e8a6f-ac23-47e1-8f55-968363f2e22f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/208487399-734e8a6f-ac23-47e1-8f55-968363f2e22f.png)

**New option scrollOnUserInput** ([#4289](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4289)) via [@JasonXJ](https://github.com/JasonXJ)

You can now specify whether to scroll to the bottom of the terminal on user input, previously this was the default and only behavior. This new setting is enabled by default.

```
const term = new Terminal({ scrollOnUserInput: false });
```

## 🛑 Breaking changes

* There is a new `allowNonHttpProtocols` property on `ILinkHandler` which forces the embedder to opt-in to non-http(s) protocols. This is a breaking change in a minor release as it could improve security of embedders.
  ```
  // before 5.1.0
  const term = new Terminal({
    linkHandler: {
      ...
    }
  };

  // after 5.1.0
  const term = new Terminal({
    linkHandler: {
      // If you explicitly support and sanitize the links
      allowNonHttpProtocols: true,
      ...
    }
  };
  ```

## 🎉 New real-world use cases

v5 is here! This is our largest release in a long time, maybe ever 👀

Since this was a major version bump, we used the opportunity to clean up the API and make other breaking changes. Many of these changes enabled a significant reduction in the `xterm` module bundle size which went from 379kb to 265kb for a 30% reduction!

## 🚀 Features

**Underline style and color support** ([#3921](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3921), [#3976](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3976), [#3980](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3980), [#4053](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4053), [#4068](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4068), [#4074](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4074), [#4077](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4077), [#4109](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4109)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

Underline style and color sequences such as `CSI 4:2m ST` for double underlines are now supported:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/190488671-f25a9613-8ada-455e-b2a2-583bae1dd5e2.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/190488671-f25a9613-8ada-455e-b2a2-583bae1dd5e2.png)

Some work was also done to improve underline rendering overall, characters with long descenders don't overlap with the underline:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/190488814-d273c868-8323-4b0d-9ade-df6d8c3bfb16.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/190488814-d273c868-8323-4b0d-9ade-df6d8c3bfb16.png)

**Hyperlink escape sequence support** ([#4005](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4005), [#4087](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4087), [#4088](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4088)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar), [@jerch](https://github.com/jerch)

Building upon the improved underline rendering, hyperlink escapes [outlined in this gist](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) are now supported. They will be rendered using a dashed underline (like `CSI 4:5m ST`):

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/190489364-8e06128e-e6fd-4364-bbad-25decbeb9c00.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/190489364-8e06128e-e6fd-4364-bbad-25decbeb9c00.png)

Along with this is a new `linkHandler` option which allows controling hover, leave and activate events, for example to show a custom tooltip. VS Code's implementation looks like this:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/190490180-00e5aa4a-34b6-435a-a5a2-e8daf1ab6009.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2193314/190490180-00e5aa4a-34b6-435a-a5a2-e8daf1ab6009.png)

**Smooth scroll support** ([#3940](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3940)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

The new `smoothScrollDuration` allows setting a duration in milliseconds to animate scroll between the origin and target positions. This is most useful when using a physical mouse (not a trackpad) to help not disorient the user when scrolling with the mouse wheel.

**Canvas renderer addon** ([#3949](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3949), [#3950](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3950), [#3954](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3954), [#3959](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3959), [#3961](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3961), [#3981](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3981)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

The canvas renderer has moved into an addon, significantly reducing the bundle size of the `xterm` module. This used to be the default renderer and is now recommended only as a fallback to the webgl addon if that does not work for some reason (eg. no webgl2 support).

**New VT feature support** ([#4093](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4093), [#4095](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4095), [#4098](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4098))via [@jerch](https://github.com/jerch)

* Support setting extended ansi colors 16-255 ([#3905](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3905), [#3909](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3909)) via [@silamon](https://github.com/silamon), [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)
* The `parser` and `buffer` APIs are now stable ([#3951](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3951)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

## 🛑 Breaking changes

* `bellSound` and `bellStyle` options as well as the previously builtin sound have been removed ([#3941](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3941)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar). This reduces the bundle size while still allowing the embedder to support the terminal bell via the `Terminal.onBell` API

  ```
  // before 5.0.0
  term = new Terminal({
    bellStyle: 'sound'
  });

  // after 5.0.0
  term = new Terminal();
  term.onBell(() => {
    // Play a sound
  });
  ```
* The link matcher API `registerLinkMatcher` and `deregisterLinkMatcher` have been removed in favor of the link provider API ([#3944](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3944)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar).
* The `allowProposedApi` option now defaults to `false`, set this to `true` to opt-in to proposed API usage if you understand the implications ([#3945](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3945)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

  ```
  // before 5.0.0
  term = new Terminal({});
  term.someProposedApi();

  // after 5.0.0
  term = new Terminal({
    allowProposedApi: true
  });
  term.someProposedApi();
  ```
* The deprecated `addMarker` API has been removed in favor of `registerMarker` ([#3946](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3946)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar). They are functionally equivalent.
* The deprecated `getOption` and `setOption` APIs have been removed in favor of `options` ([#3947](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3947)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

  ```
  // before 5.0.0
  term.setOption('scrollback', 1000);
  console.log(term.getOption('scrollback'));

  // after 5.0.0
  term.options.scrollback = 1000;
  console.log(term.options.scrollback);
  ```
* The deprecated `writeUtf8` API has been removed in favor of `write` ([#3947](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3947)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar).

  ```
  const arr = new Uint8Array(10);

  // before 5.0.0
  term.writeUtf8(arr);

  // after 5.0.0
  term.write(arr);
  ```
* `ISelectionPosition` have been removed from the API in favor of `IBufferRange` ([#3952](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3952)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)
* `cols` and `rows` options can now only be set in the constructor ([#3960](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3960), [#3972](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3972), [#4078](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4078)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar), [@silamon](https://github.com/silamon)

  ```
  // before 5.0.0
  term.setOption('cols', 10);

  // after 5.0.0
  term.resize(10, term.rows);
  ```
* `ITheme.selection` has been renamed to `selectionBackground` for consistency ([#3964](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3964)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

  ```
  // before 5.0.0
  term.options.theme = { selection: '#000000' };

  // after 5.0.0
  term.options.theme = { selectionBackground: '#000000' };
  ```
* The `Terminal.options` getter now returns a `Required<ITerminalOptions>` instead of just `ITerminalOptions` for better correctness. Along with this change `fastScrollModifier` now accepts `'none'` instead of `undefined`

  ```
  // before 5.0.0
  new Terminal({ fastScrollModifier: undefined });

  // after 5.0.0
  new Terminal({ fastScrollModifier: 'none' });
  ```

### xterm-addon-webgl

**More efficient GPU memory usage using new texture atlas packing strategy** ([#3979](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3979)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

The previous naive texture packing strategy which only allowed adding to the "active row" or below has been replaced with a new strategy that uses multiple active rows and adds glyphs to the most suitable row based on its pixel height. This leads to more effective usage of the texture xterm.js uploads to the GPU, meaning it's harder to reset the texture when it becomes filled (which is more likely to happen when screen scale is high).

* The minimum contrast ratio feature will now change luminance in the opposite direction if the contrast ratio isn't met ([#3806](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3806), [#3808](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3808)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar). For example a red foreground on a slightly darker red background will try lighten the color and if the `minimumContrastRatio` option isn't met when `#FFFFFF` is reached it will try moving it towards `#000000`. This can cause somewhat unexpected results by changing explicitly styled whites to blacks for example but it's really good for accessibility.
* The library now supports parsing `#rgb`, `#rgba`, `rgb(r, g, b)` and `rgba(r, g, b, a)` color formats ([#3815](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3815), [#3819](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3819), [#3823](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3823)) via [@ChaseKnowlden](https://github.com/ChaseKnowlden), [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)
* Opaque `selectionBackground` is now supported in the DOM renderer ([#3839](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3839)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)
* The symbol powerline font glyphs now use custom rendering when `ITerminalOptions.customGlyphs` is enabled ([#3856](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3856), [#3862](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3862), [#3866](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3866)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)

  This has multiple benefits:
  + A patched powerlines font doesn't need to be installed to render the most common characters
  + Ugly lines due to anti-aliasing that can appear no longer do
  + The glyphs always use greyscale anti-aliasing (not sub-pixel)
  + `ITerminalOptions.lineHeight` is taken into account when rendering the glyph

### 📦 API

* The overview ruler is a companion feature to the decorations introduced in 4.18.0 which shows little indicators on the scroll bar ([#3676](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3676), [#3687](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3687), [#3688](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3688), [#3689](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3689), [#3693](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3693), [#3694](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3694), [#3695](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3695), [#3697](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3697), [#3702](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3702), [#3711](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3711), [#3723](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3723), [#3730](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3730), [#3733](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3733), [#3738](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3738), [#3788](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3788), [#3791](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3791), [#3792](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3792), [#3841](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3841)) via [@meganrogge](https://github.com/meganrogge), [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar). To use it, add the `overviewRulerOptions` property to a decoration's `IDecorationOptions` and it will automatically show up in the overview ruler.
  ```
  const marker = term.addMarker(1);
  const decoration = term.registerDecoration({
    marker,
    x: 5,
    overviewRulerOptions: {
      color: '#FF0000',
      position: 'left'
    }
  });
  decoration.onRender(() => {
    decoration.element.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
  });
  ```

  The width of the resulting overview ruler is controlled by `ITerminalOptions.overviewRulerWidth`.
* Decorations can now change a cell's background and foreground colors ([#3775](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3775), [#3782](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3782)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar). When this is set, the minimum contrast ratio feature will also be in effect.
  ```
  const decoration = term.registerDecoration({
    marker,
    backgroundColor: '#ff0000',
    foregroundColor: '#ffffff'
  });
  ```
* Decorations can now specify the layer property to allow rendering above the selection ([#3785](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3785), [#3800](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3800)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)
  ```
  const decoration = term.registerDecoration({
    marker,
    layer: 'top'
  });
  ```
* There's a new `selectionForeground` theme color, when set this will use a static color for selections ([#3813](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/3813)) via [@Tyriar](https://github.com/Tyriar)
  ```
  const term = new Terminal({
    theme: {
      selectionBackground: '#000000',
      selectionForeground: '#FFFFFF'
    }
  });
  ```

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1668531#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-01-23 02:44:42 UTC  ``` A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Xterm.js before versions 3.8.1, 3.9.2 and 3.10.1 when the component mishandles special characters.   Upstream Releases:  <https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/releases/tag/3.8.1> <https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/releases/tag/3.9.2> <https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/releases/tag/3.10.1>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1668531#c2)  Sam Fowler    2019-01-23 05:39:53 UTC  ``` Upstream Patches:  <https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/commit/50abb43e> <https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/commit/eeca95b6> <https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/commit/f3bfcc36> <https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/commit/3592c641>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1668531#c9)  Sam Fowler    2019-05-07 04:16:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects both the atomic-openshift-web-console RPM and openshift3/ose-console container image shipped in OpenShift Container Platform. These components provide a web console for opening in-browser terminals in cluster pods. Successful exploitation of this issue would require an attacker to convince an authorized user to open an in-browser terminal on a target pod and execute a command that prints attacker-controlled input. Red Hat Product Security have rated this issue as having security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1668531#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-10 16:55:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:1422 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1422](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1422)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1668531#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-22 01:45:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.10  Via RHSA-2019:2552 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2552](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2552)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1668531#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-05 05:03:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9  Via RHSA-2019:2551 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2551](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2551)   ``` |  |
