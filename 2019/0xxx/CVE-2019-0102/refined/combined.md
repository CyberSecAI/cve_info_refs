### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Intel’s Product Security Incident Response Team reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Intel recommends that affected users contact an Intel Data Center Manager SDK reseller for the Version 5.0.2 update. A list of resellers can be found at:

<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/intel-dcm-where-to-buy.html>

For more information, see Intel security advisory INTEL-SA-00215 at:

<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00215.html>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

- Update to version 7.0.0
\* Breaking changes
- Removed PhantomJS: PhantomJS was deprecated in Grafana v6.4 and
starting from Grafana v7.0.0, all PhantomJS support has been
removed. This means that Grafana no longer ships with a built-in
image renderer, and we advise you to install the Grafana Image
Renderer plugin.
- Dashboard: A global minimum dashboard refresh interval is now
enforced and defaults to 5 seconds.
- Interval calculation: There is now a new option Max data points that
controls the auto interval $\_\_interval calculation. Interval was
previously calculated by dividing the panel width by the time range.
With the new max data points option it is now easy to set
$\_\_interval to a dynamic value that is time range agnostic. For
example if you set Max data points to 10 Grafana will dynamically
set $\_\_interval by dividing the current time range by 10.
- Datasource/Loki: Support for deprecated Loki endpoints has been
removed.
- Backend plugins: Grafana now requires backend plugins to be signed,
otherwise Grafana will not load/start them. This is an additional
security measure to make sure backend plugin binaries and files
haven't been tampered with. Refer to Upgrade Grafana for more
information.
- @grafana/ui: Forms migration notice, see @grafana/ui changelog
- @grafana/ui: Select API change for creating custom values, see
@grafana/ui changelog
+ Deprecation warnings
- Scripted dashboards is now deprecated. The feature is not removed
but will be in a future release. We hope to address the underlying
requirement of dynamic dashboards in a different way. #24059
- The unofficial first version of backend plugins together with
usage of grafana/grafana-plugin-model is now deprecated and support for
that will be removed in a future release. Please refer to backend plugins
documentation for information about the new officially supported backend
plugins.

- Slack: Removed Mention setting and instead introduce Mention Users,
Mention Groups, and Mention Channel. The first two settings require
user and group IDs, respectively. This change was necessary because
the way of mentioning via the Slack API changed and mentions in Slack
notifications no longer worked.
- Alerting: Reverts the behavior of diff and percent\_diff to not always
be absolute. Something we introduced by mistake in 6.1.0. Alerting
now support diff(), diff\_abs(), percent\_diff() and
percent\_diff\_abs(). #21338
- Notice about changes in backendSrv for plugin authors In our mission
to migrate away from AngularJS to React we have removed all AngularJS
dependencies in the core data retrieval service backendSrv. Removing
the AngularJS dependencies in backendSrv has the unfortunate side
effect of AngularJS digest no longer being triggered for any request
made with backendSrv. Because of this, external plugins using
backendSrv directly may suffer from strange behaviour in the UI. To
remedy this issue, as a plugin author you need to trigger the digest
after a direct call to backendSrv. Bug Fixes API: Fix redirect issues.

\* Breaking changes
+ Annotations There are some breaking changes in the annotations HTTP
API for region annotations. Region annotations are now represented
using a single event instead of two seperate events. Check breaking
changes in HTTP API below and HTTP API documentation for more
details.
+ Docker Grafana is now using Alpine 3.10 as docker base image.
+ HTTP API
- GET /api/alert-notifications now requires at least editor access.
New /api/alert-notifications/lookup returns less information than
/api/alert-notifications and can be access by any authenticated user.
- GET /api/alert-notifiers now requires at least editor access
- GET /api/org/users now requires org admin role. New
/api/org/users/lookup returns less information than /api/org/users and can
be access by users that are org admins, admin in any folder or admin of
any team.
- GET /api/annotations no longer returns regionId property.
- POST /api/annotations no longer supports isRegion property.
- PUT /api/annotations/:id no longer supports isRegion property.
- PATCH /api/annotations/:id no longer supports isRegion property.
- DELETE /api/annotations/region/:id has been removed.
\* Deprecation notes
+ PhantomJS
- PhantomJS, which is used for rendering images of dashboards and
panels, is deprecated and will be removed in a future Grafana release. A
deprecation warning will from now on be logged when Grafana starts up if
PhantomJS is in use. Please consider migrating from PhantomJS to the
Grafana Image Renderer plugin.
