## CVE-2019-0230

The provided content relates to **CVE-2019-0230**, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Struts.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Forced double OGNL evaluation on raw user input in tag attributes. The Struts framework, when forced, performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags (like `id`). This allows an attacker to inject a raw OGNL expression into a tag attribute, which gets evaluated when the tag is rendered.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation of incoming parameters' values when re-assigning them to Struts tag attributes. Specifically, the use of `%{...}` or `${...}` syntax referencing user-modifiable input in tag attributes (other than `value`) without validation.
*   **Vulnerability:** Double evaluation of OGNL expressions.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting a malicious request containing a specially crafted OGNL expression.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker modifies a request to inject a raw OGNL expression into a tag attribute. For example, by manipulating the `skillName` attribute in the provided example:

    ```html
    <s:url var="url" namespace="/employee" action="list"/><s:a id="%{skillName}" href="%{url}">List available Employees</s:a>
    ```
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to modify request parameters that are then used in tag attributes.
*   **Affected Software:** Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.5.20

The identified solution is to validate input, avoid forced evaluation of attributes other than "value", and upgrade to Struts 2.5.22 or greater.
