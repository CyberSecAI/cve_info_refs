The provided content describes a bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195 in Apache Tapestry, which leads to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-27850).

*   **Vulnerability:** Bypass of a blacklist filter designed to prevent arbitrary class file downloads.
*   **Root Cause:** The original fix for CVE-2019-0195 used a blacklist to prevent downloading files with extensions like `.class`, `.properties`, and `.xml`. This blacklist can be bypassed by appending a `/` to the end of the URL.
*   **Attack Vector:** By requesting a URL with a `/` appended after the restricted file extension (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class/`), the attacker can bypass the blacklist. The server strips the slash after the check and serves the file.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can download arbitrary class files, including `AppModule.class`, which often contains a HMAC secret key. With this key, the attacker can sign Java gadget chains, leading to remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Affected Versions:** Apache Tapestry versions 5.4.5, 5.5.0, 5.6.2, and 5.7.0.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Apache Tapestry instance. Knowledge of the HMAC secret key allows the attacker to construct a Java gadget chain for RCE.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Apache Tapestry 5.6.2 or later for versions 5.4.0 to 5.6.2, and upgrade to 5.7.1 or later for version 5.7.0.
