{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `IPAddress.TryCreate` method within the .NET Core framework. When processing certain web requests, this method can be triggered to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of web requests within .NET Core and ASP.NET Core.",
    "Specifically, the `IPAddress.TryCreate` method is vulnerable to crashing when processing certain inputs."
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) against a .NET Core application by sending specially crafted web requests that trigger the vulnerable `IPAddress.TryCreate` method.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Remote exploitation via specially crafted web requests.",
    "The vulnerability can be exploited over a network."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": [
    "Ability to send network requests to a vulnerable .NET Core application."
  ],
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is specific to the `IPAddress.TryCreate` method and its interaction with web request processing in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core applications. The issue is fixed in .NET Core Runtime 2.1.11 and SDK 2.1.507."
