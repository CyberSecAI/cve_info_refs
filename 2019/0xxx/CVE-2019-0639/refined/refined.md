  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before reading from memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer Overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel. Information Disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
