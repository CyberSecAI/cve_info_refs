Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-0090:

*   **Vulnerability Description:** CVE-2019-0090 describes an "Insufficient access control vulnerability in subsystem for Intel(R) CSME versions 11.x, Intel(R) CSME version 12.0.35, Intel(R) TXE versions 3.x, 4.x, Intel(R) Server Platform Services versions 3.x, 4.x, before SPS\_E3\_05.01.03.094.0 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via physical access."
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises because the Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) within the Intel CSME is disabled by default when the CSME is coming out of reset. This creates a small window of time (several hundred microseconds) where Root Space 1 (RS1) DMA transactions can reach the CSME SRAM *before* the CSME ROM enables the IOMMU protection.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient access control in the CSME subsystem during the initial phase of CSME ROM execution. The IOMMU, which is responsible for controlling which IPs can send DMA transactions to specific areas in CSME SRAM, is not enabled immediately after reset.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker needs physical access to the system. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by:

    1.  Compromising the firmware of an IP that has RS1 DMA capability (e.g., Integrated Sensor Hub (ISH)).
    2.  Bypassing Root of Trust (RoT) protection and running their own firmware in an IP with RS1 DMA capability (on systems without End of Manufacturing (EOM) applied).
    3.  Achieving direct access to RS1 DMA capability.
*   **Impact:** A successful attack could allow an attacker to:

    *   Read and write to CSME SRAM.
    *   Compromise confidentiality of the CSME SRAM.
    *   Compromise integrity of the CSME ROM (e.g., through Return Oriented Programming).
    *   Gain access to CSME chipset and attestation keys, including the Intel Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) private key and the Intel Platform Trust Technology (PTT) Endorsement Key (EK).
    *   Load their own CSME firmware.
    *   Compromise CSME use-cases on the system, such as Intel Boot Guard, Intel PTT, Protected Audio Video Path (PAVP), Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Dynamic Application Loader (DAL), and more. This could lead to escalation of privilege, information disclosure, and/or denial of service.
*   **Affected Products:** Intel CSME versions 11.x, Intel CSME version 12.0.35, Intel TXE versions 3.x, 4.x, Intel Server Platform Services versions 3.x, 4.x, before SPS\_E3\_05.01.03.094.0.
*   **Mitigation:**

    *   Newer systems have the IOMMU enabled by default in CSME hardware.
    *   CSME Firmware updates have been released to help prevent RS1 DMA transactions from reaching CSME SRAM while the IOMMU is disabled.
    *   Hardware-based Anti-rollback (ARB) capability prevents physical rollback of the CSME Firmware.
    *   Applying End of Manufacturing (EOM) settings.

    Specifically, for CNP-based systems, the CSME Firmware update blocks RS1 DMA transactions to the CSME at the PCH fabric level before the CSME enters low-power mode (aka Power Gating) or initiates a CSME reset.

    For BXT-P and GLK-based platforms, the CSME Firmware change consists of disabling USB DbC (debug capability) interface when end of manufacturing has been applied to the system and SoC debug interface is closed.
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 High ([CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))
