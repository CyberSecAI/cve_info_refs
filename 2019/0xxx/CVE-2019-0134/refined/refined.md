- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper permissions in the Intel(R) Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to improper permissions. This allows an authenticated user to potentially execute code at an elevated privilege level.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation, potentially allowing an attacker to execute code with higher privileges than intended.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have local access to the system. The attack requires user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user and have local access to the system.
