# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-4186-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 ESM.

Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo,

Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz

Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, and Jo Van Bulck discovered that Intel

processors using Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) could

expose memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers to a

malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11135](/security/CVE-2019-11135))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets allowed userspace

to modify page table entries via writes to MMIO from the Blitter Command

Streamer and expose kernel memory information. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges.

([CVE-2019-0155](/security/CVE-2019-0155))

Deepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel

did not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual

guest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to

cause a denial of service (host system crash). ([CVE-2018-12207](/security/CVE-2018-12207))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets could cause a

system hang when userspace performed a read from GT memory mapped input

output (MMIO) when the product is in certain low power states. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-0154](/security/CVE-2019-0154))

Hui Peng discovered that the Atheros AR6004 USB Wi-Fi device driver for the

Linux kernel did not properly validate endpoint descriptors returned by the

device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15098](/security/CVE-2019-15098))

Ori Nimron discovered that the AX25 network protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker

could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17052](/security/CVE-2019-17052))

Ori Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform

permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.

([CVE-2019-17053](/security/CVE-2019-17053))

Ori Nimron discovered that the Appletalk network protocol implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local

attacker could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17054](/security/CVE-2019-17054))

Ori Nimron discovered that the modular ISDN network protocol implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local

attacker could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17055](/security/CVE-2019-17055))

Ori Nimron discovered that the Near field Communication (NFC) network

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform

permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.

([CVE-2019-17056](/security/CVE-2019-17056))

Nico Waisman discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Realtek Wi-Fi

driver for the Linux kernel when handling Notice of Absence frames. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-17666](/security/CVE-2019-17666))

Please note that mitigating the TSX (CVE-2019-11135) and i915

(CVE-2019-0154) issues requires corresponding microcode and graphics

firmware updates respectively.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-07-08 11:28:36 UTC  ``` The Bluetooth BR/EDR encryption key negotiation protocol is vulnerable to packet injection that could allow an unauthenticated user to decrease the size of the entropy of the encryption key, potentially causing information disclosure and/or escalation of privileges via adjacent access. There is not currently any knowledge of this being exploited.  Note:  Not all bluetooth devices are vulnerable to this flaw. Only devices that can connect to another using BR/EDR encryption negotiation protocol.   CERT notification: <https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/918987/>  Upstream patches: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d5bb334a8e171b262e48f378bd2096c0ea458265> <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=693cd8ce3f882524a5d06f7800dd8492411877b3> <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eca94432934fe5f141d084f2e36ee2c0e614cc04>  Branded site: <https://knobattack.com/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-07-10 04:24:10 UTC  ``` This is a flaw in the bluetooth protocol. As per the report: "The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) is in the process of adjusting the specification to mitigate this issue. They are continuing to work with controller and host vendors to implement patches once the specification is changed, so be aware that patches and additional notifications may be coming from upstream vendors. We strongly recommend that these patches are implemented when they are available. We will communicate more information in regards to this vulnerability as we receive it."  Basically seems like a hardware issue to me.   The notice for CERT is a heads-up. We probably need to wait till we see "patches".   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c4)  Wade Mealing    2019-08-19 01:14:49 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  At this time there is no known mitigation if bluetooth hardware is to be continue to be used.   Replacing the hardware with its wired version and disabling bluetooth may be a suitable alternative for some environments.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c5)  Wade Mealing    2019-08-19 01:46:37 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1743055](show_bug.cgi?id=1743055 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-9506 kernel: : hardware: bluetooth : BR/EDR encryption key negotiation attacks (KNOB) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c9)  Wade Mealing    2019-08-19 02:55:14 UTC  ``` This flaw is rated as important due to the possible follow-on effects.

[slackware-security]  Slackware 14.2 kernel (SSA:2019-320-01)

New kernel packages are available for Slackware 14.2 to fix security issues.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/linux-4.4.202/*:  Upgraded.
   CRYPTO_CRC32C_INTEL m -> y
  +X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_AUTO n
  +X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_OFF y
  +X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_ON n
  These updates fix various bugs and security issues, including mitigation for
  the TSX Asynchronous Abort condition on some CPUs.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.
  For more information, see:
    Fixed in 4.4.201:
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0155>
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0154>
    Fixed in 4.4.202:
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11135>
  (* Security fix *)

Installation instructions:
+------------------------+

Upgrade the packages as root:
# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.202-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.202 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.202-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.202 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.

## Overview

Red Hat is aware of two flaws in the i915 graphics hardware requiring updates to the Linux kernel. These vulnerabilities only apply to a subset of x86-64 systems using Intel processors with embedded i915 based GPU’s.

The first issue, assigned [CVE-2019-0155](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-0155) and is rated [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/), allows a local attacker to bypass conventional memory security restrictions. This allows write access to privileged memory that would otherwise be inaccessible.

The second issue, assigned [CVE-2019-0154](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-0154) and is rated [Moderate](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/), allows an unprivileged, local attacker to create an invalid state while the GPU is in low-power mode. This allows the system to become inaccessible and requires a system restart to resume normal operations.

### Background

The i915 kernel code covers a diverse range of chips for the on-die CPU/GPU combination shipped by Intel in many products. This driver is widely used since the Pentium 4 processor and has had various levels of improvements throughout the life of the product.

The affected GPUs are not an external PCI-E card, but is instead an on-die CPU component. This graphics card requires motherboard support which provides the physical connection mechanism to the output device.

These flaws do not affect all i915-based hardware. Consult the *Determine Vulnerability* section below to determine if your system is affected.

## Determine Vulnerability

* The specific hardware is only available on the i915 kernel module. Other graphics cards are not affected. The lsmod command will show if the i915 kernel module is in use.

```
$ lsmod | grep ^i915
i915                2248704  10

```

If the lsmod command returns a line starting with i915 then continue, otherwise you are not affected.

* Find the CPU model provided by your system. The example below is an “Intel Core i7-7600U”.

```
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep "model name" |head -n 1
model name    : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7600U CPU @ 2.80GHz

```

* Determine the hardware generation with instructions from Intel’s instructions ( See [Intel’s Processor number identification guide)](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com.au%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fau%2Fen%2Fprocessors%2Fprocessor-numbers.html)
* Compare the processor “Brand” and “Generation identifier” to the list of affected configurations below.

### Affected Configurations

The systems affected by [CVE-2019-0154](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-0154) are:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 ( kernel-2.6.32-612.el6 and later)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ( kernel-3.10.0-422.el7 and later)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 (and z streams) and earlier are not affected by default and is only affected if the system is booted with the kernel parameter i915.preliminary\_hw\_support=1. This parameter is not enabled by default.

Running on hardware:

* Ivy Bridge (Intel Core Generation 7 CPUs and later
* Cherry Trail (Intel Core Generation 8 CPUs) and later
* Intel XEON E3-1200 and later product families

The systems affected by [CVE-2019-0155](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-0155) are:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ( kernel-3.10.0-422.el7 and later)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

Running on hardware:

* Sky Lake and Apollo Lake (Intel Core Generation 9 CPUS) and later
* Intel Xeon Processor (E3-1500 v5) family

Systems containing chipsets earlier than the above listed in the same family are not affected. Other graphics card vendors are not affected by this flaw.

## Resolution

A kernel update that will solve the issue will be released for all Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases that qualify for an update.

## Acknowledgements

Red Hat thanks Intel and their industry partner for reporting this issue.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Will blacklisting the kernel module provide mitigation ?

A: Preventing loading of the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system; however, the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See [“How do I blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically?“](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module from autoloading. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly. This mitigation may not be suitable if running graphical tools locally is required.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1724398#c0)  Wade Mealing    2019-06-27 01:33:13 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Intel graphics hardware (GPU) where a local attacker with the ability to issue commands to the GPU which could inadvertently lead to memory corruption and possibly privilege escalation.  The attacker could use the GPU blitter to perform privilege MMIO operations not limited to the address space required to function correctly.  This would expose the blitter to access kernel memory with a specially crafted request to the blitter.  Affected hardware:  - Ivy Bridge(Gen 7) and later,  - Cherry Trail (Gen8) and newer mobile, desktop and embedded processors. - Intel Xeon E3-1200 v4 and later product families.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1724398#c31)  Petr Matousek    2019-11-12 09:43:47 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Preventing loading of the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system however the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See this KCS article( <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278> ) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly. This mitigation may not be suitable if running graphical tools locally is required.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1724398#c32)  Petr Matousek    2019-11-12 09:45:04 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue.
