- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of specially crafted `gap-iab:` URIs in the Apache Cordova InAppBrowser plugin for Android.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation, arbitrary JavaScript execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious website loaded in an InAppBrowser instance can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the main application's webview, allowing for potential data theft, malicious actions, or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: By loading a specially crafted `gap-iab:` URI within a website viewed in the InAppBrowser webview.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to control a website that is loaded within the InAppBrowser webview on an affected Cordova application running on Android.
