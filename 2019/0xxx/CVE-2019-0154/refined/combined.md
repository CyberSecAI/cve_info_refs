| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1724393#c0)  Wade Mealing    2019-06-27 01:17:22 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Intel graphics hardware (GPU) where a local attacker with the ability to issue an ioctl could trigger a hardware level crash if MMIO registers were read while the graphics card was in a low-power state.  This creates a denial of service situation and the GPU and connected displays will remain unusable until a reboot occurs.  Intel plans to release BIOS firmware, along with updates supplied by Red Hat should mitigate this vulnerability.  Some older hardware will not have  BIOS firmware update and will rely on operating system level protection to prevent access while the device is in low-power states.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1724393#c16)  Wade Mealing    2019-10-29 00:54:48 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Preventing loading of the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system however the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See this KCS article (<https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278>) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly.  This mitigation may not be suitable if running graphical tools locally is required.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1724393#c17)  Wade Mealing    2019-11-04 04:21:02 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Intel   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1724393#c19)  Wade Mealing    2019-11-12 09:55:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  Intel plans to release BIOS firmware to correct this issue. Red Hat's kernel update should mitigate this vulnerability. Some older hardware will not have BIOS firmware update and will rely on operating system level protection to prevent access while the device is in low-power states.

## Details

USN-4186-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 ESM.

Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo,

Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz

Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, and Jo Van Bulck discovered that Intel

processors using Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) could

expose memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers to a

malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11135](/security/CVE-2019-11135))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets allowed userspace

to modify page table entries via writes to MMIO from the Blitter Command

Streamer and expose kernel memory information. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges.

([CVE-2019-0155](/security/CVE-2019-0155))

Deepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel

did not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual

guest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to

cause a denial of service (host system crash). ([CVE-2018-12207](/security/CVE-2018-12207))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets could cause a

system hang when userspace performed a read from GT memory mapped input

output (MMIO) when the product is in certain low power states. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-0154](/security/CVE-2019-0154))

Hui Peng discovered that the Atheros AR6004 USB Wi-Fi device driver for the

Linux kernel did not properly validate endpoint descriptors returned by the

device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15098](/security/CVE-2019-15098))

Ori Nimron discovered that the AX25 network protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker

could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17052](/security/CVE-2019-17052))

Ori Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform

permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.

([CVE-2019-17053](/security/CVE-2019-17053))

Ori Nimron discovered that the Appletalk network protocol implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local

attacker could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17054](/security/CVE-2019-17054))

Ori Nimron discovered that the modular ISDN network protocol implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local

attacker could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17055](/security/CVE-2019-17055))

Ori Nimron discovered that the Near field Communication (NFC) network

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform

permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.

([CVE-2019-17056](/security/CVE-2019-17056))

Nico Waisman discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Realtek Wi-Fi

driver for the Linux kernel when handling Notice of Absence frames. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-17666](/security/CVE-2019-17666))

Please note that mitigating the TSX (CVE-2019-11135) and i915

(CVE-2019-0154) issues requires corresponding microcode and graphics

firmware updates respectively.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

[slackware-security]  Slackware 14.2 kernel (SSA:2019-320-01)

New kernel packages are available for Slackware 14.2 to fix security issues.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/linux-4.4.202/*:  Upgraded.
   CRYPTO_CRC32C_INTEL m -> y
  +X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_AUTO n
  +X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_OFF y
  +X86_INTEL_TSX_MODE_ON n
  These updates fix various bugs and security issues, including mitigation for
  the TSX Asynchronous Abort condition on some CPUs.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

Installation instructions:
+------------------------+

Upgrade the packages as root:
# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.202-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.202 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.202-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.202 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1724398#c0)  Wade Mealing    2019-06-27 01:33:13 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Intel graphics hardware (GPU) where a local attacker with the ability to issue commands to the GPU which could inadvertently lead to memory corruption and possibly privilege escalation.  The attacker could use the GPU blitter to perform privilege MMIO operations not limited to the address space required to function correctly.  This would expose the blitter to access kernel memory with a specially crafted request to the blitter.  Affected hardware:  - Ivy Bridge(Gen 7) and later,  - Cherry Trail (Gen8) and newer mobile, desktop and embedded processors. - Intel Xeon E3-1200 v4 and later product families.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1724398#c31)  Petr Matousek    2019-11-12 09:43:47 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Preventing loading of the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system however the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See this KCS article( <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278> ) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly.
