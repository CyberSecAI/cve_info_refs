Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-0657:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `System.Uri` class in .NET Core insufficiently validates input, specifically the `IdnHost` property.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Domain spoofing vulnerability due to improper validation of Unicode characters. Certain Unicode characters could be used to change the interpretation of a URI after IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) encoding is applied.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially craft URIs that appear legitimate but redirect users to malicious websites, leading to phishing or other attacks. This can cause users to be tricked into visiting a site that is not the intended one.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker would need to create a crafted URI containing specific Unicode characters, which when interpreted could lead to domain spoofing.
- The vulnerability is within the .NET core library. Applications utilizing the vulnerable `System.Uri` class can expose the vulnerability if they handle user-provided URI strings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious URI to the victim, typically this would be done over the internet, through links in emails or websites. 
- No specific user privileges or access to the target system is required, it is an issue with parsing of URIs, not system privileges.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in .NET Core versions 1.0.14, 1.1.11, 2.1.8, and 2.2.2.
- Red Hat has issued RHSA-2019:0349 as a security advisory to address this vulnerability.
