## Details

It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(Wi-Fi disconnect). ([CVE-2019-0136](/security/CVE-2019-0136))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-10207](/security/CVE-2019-10207))

It was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13631](/security/CVE-2019-13631))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds read existed in the QLogic QEDI

iSCSI Initiator Driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly

use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-15090](/security/CVE-2019-15090))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15117](/security/CVE-2019-15117))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the

Linux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta

data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15118](/security/CVE-2019-15118))

It was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free.

A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15211](/security/CVE-2019-15211))

It was discovered at a double-free error existed in the USB Rio 500 device

driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-15212](/security/CVE-2019-15212))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the CPiA2 video4linux

device driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15215](/security/CVE-2019-15215))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Softmac USB Prism54

device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15220](/security/CVE-2019-15220))

not properly handle an error condition when out of disk quota. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2019-15538](/security/CVE-2019-15538))

It was discovered that the Hisilicon HNS3 ethernet device driver in the

Linux kernel contained an out of bounds access vulnerability. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15925](/security/CVE-2019-15925))

It was discovered that the Atheros mobile chipset driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate data in some situations. An attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15926](/security/CVE-2019-15926))

Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper B. Rasmussen discovered

that the Bluetooth protocol BR/EDR specification did not properly require

sufficiently strong encryption key lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-9506](/security/CVE-2019-9506))

It was discovered that ZR364XX Camera USB device driver for the Linux

kernel did not properly initialize memory. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15217](/security/CVE-2019-15217))

It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the

Linux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A

physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15218](/security/CVE-2019-15218))

It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate data size information from the device. A

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 869511 945023

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-13093, CVE-2018-13094

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported several NULL pointer
    dereference flaws that may be triggered when mounting and
    operating a crafted XFS volume.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary XFS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14615

    It was discovered that Intel 9th and 10th generation GPUs did not
    clear user-visible state during a context switch, which resulted
    in information leaks between GPU tasks.  This has been mitigated
    in the i915 driver.

    The affected chips (gen9 and gen10) are listed at
    <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen9>>.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver
    did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a
    null pointer derefernce.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15217

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not
    correctly handle devices without a product name string, which
    could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15291

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media
    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17075

    It was found that the cxgb4 Infiniband driver requested DMA
    (Direct Memory Access) to a stack-allocated buffer, which is not
    supported and on some systems can result in memory corruption of
    the stack.  A local user might be able to use this for denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-18282

    Jonathan Berger, Amit Klein, and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of UDP/IPv6 flow labels used a weak hash function,
    "jhash".  This could enable tracking individual computers as they
    communicate with different remote servers and from different
    networks.  The "siphash" function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-18683

    Multiple race conditions were discovered in the vivid media
    driver, used for testing Video4Linux2 (V4L2) applications,
    These race conditions could result in a use-after-free.  On a
    system where this driver is loaded, a user with permission
    to access media devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-18809

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the af9005
    media driver if the device fails to respond to a command.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19037

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not
    correctly handle directories with holes (unallocated regions) in
    them.  An attacker able to mount arbitrary ext4 volumes could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2019-19051

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the i2400m
    wimax driver if the software rfkill operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

Debian Bug     : 930904

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-9506

    Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen
    discovered a weakness in the Bluetooth pairing protocols, dubbed
    the "KNOB attack".  An attacker that is nearby during pairing
    could use this to weaken the encryption used between the paired
    devices, and then to eavesdrop on and/or spoof communication
    between them.

    This update mitigates the attack by requiring a minimum encryption
    key length of 56 bits.

CVE-2019-11487

    Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE (Filesystem-in-Userspace)
    facility could be used to cause integer overflow in page reference
    counts, leading to a use-after-free.  On a system with sufficient
    physical memory, a local user permitted to create arbitrary FUSE
    mounts could use this for privilege escalation.

    By default, unprivileged users can only mount FUSE filesystems
    through fusermount, which limits the number of mounts created and
    should completely mitigate the issue.

CVE-2019-15211

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the radio-raremono driver that
    could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15212

    The syzkaller tool found that the rio500 driver does not work
    correctly if more than one device is bound to it.  An attacker
    able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-15215

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the cpia2_usb driver that leads
    to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15216

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the yurex driver that leads to
    a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15218

    The syzkaller tool found that the smsusb driver did not validate
    that USB devices have the expected endpoints, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15219

    The syzkaller tool found that a device initialisation error in the
    sisusbvga driver could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An
    attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15220

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in the p54usb driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15221

    The syzkaller tool found that the line6 driver did not validate
    USB devices' maximum packet sizes, which could lead to a heap
    buffer overrun.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15292

    The Hulk Robot tool found missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15538

    Benjamin Moody reported that operations on XFS hung after a
    chgrp command failed due to a disk quota.  A local user on a
    system using XFS and disk quotas could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2019-15666

    The Hulk Robot tool found an incorrect range check in the network
    transformation (xfrm) layer, leading to out-of-bounds memory
    accesses.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15807

    Jian Luo reported that the Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas)
    did not correctly handle failure to discover devices beyond a SAS
    expander.  This could lead to a resource leak and crash (BUG).
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15924

    The Hulk Robot tool found a missing error check in the fm10k
    Ethernet driver, which could lead to a null pointer dereference
    and crash (BUG/oops).  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15926

    It was found that the ath6kl wifi driver did not consistently
    validate traffic class numbers in received control packets,
    leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses.  A nearby attacker on
    the same wifi network could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.189-3~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15218](/security/CVE-2019-15218))

It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate data size information from the device. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15221](/security/CVE-2019-15221))

Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some

situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing

outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3701](/security/CVE-2019-3701))

Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's

HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some

situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2019-3819](/security/CVE-2019-3819))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2019-15807 CVE-2019-15917 CVE-2019-15926

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10905

    A race condition was discovered in the GFS2 file-system
    implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system
    using GFS2, a local attacker could use this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-9506

    Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen
    discovered a weakness in the Bluetooth pairing protocols, dubbed
    the "KNOB attack".  An attacker that is nearby during pairing
    could use this to weaken the encryption used between the paired
    devices, and then to eavesdrop on and/or spoof communication
    between them.

    This update mitigates the attack by requiring a minimum encryption
    key length of 56 bits.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14821

    Matt Delco reported a race condition in KVM's coalesced MMIO
    facility, which could lead to out-of-bounds access in the kernel.
    A local attacker permitted to access /dev/kvm could use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14835

    Peter Pi of Tencent Blade Team discovered a missing bounds check
    in vhost_net, the network back-end driver for KVM hosts, leading
    to a buffer overflow when the host begins live migration of a VM.
    An attacker in control of a VM could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation on the host.

CVE-2019-15117

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported a missing bounds check in the
    usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a buffer
    over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2019-15118

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported unbounded recursion in the
    usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a stack
    overflow.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15211

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the radio-raremono driver that
    could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15212

    The syzkaller tool found that the rio500 driver does not work
    correctly if more than one device is bound to it.  An attacker
    able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-15215

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the cpia2_usb driver that leads
    to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15218

    The syzkaller tool found that the smsusb driver did not validate
    that USB devices have the expected endpoints, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15219

    The syzkaller tool found that a device initialisation error in the
    sisusbvga driver could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An
    attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15220

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in the p54usb driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15221

    The syzkaller tool found that the line6 driver did not validate
    USB devices' maximum packet sizes, which could lead to a heap
    buffer overrun.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15292

    The Hulk Robot tool found missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15807

    Jian Luo reported that the Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas)
    did not correctly handle failure to discover devices beyond a SAS
    expander.  This could lead to a resource leak and crash (BUG).
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15926

    It was found that the ath6kl wifi driver did not consistently
    validate traffic class numbers in received control packets,
    leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses.  A nearby attacker on
    the same wifi network could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.74-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15221](/security/CVE-2019-15221))

Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some

situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing

outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3701](/security/CVE-2019-3701))

Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's

HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some

situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2019-3819](/security/CVE-2019-3819))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the GFS2 file system in

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-10905](/security/CVE-2016-10905))

It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate socket options in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18509](/security/CVE-2017-18509))

It was discovered that the USB gadget Midi driver in the Linux kernel

contained a double-free vulnerability when handling certain error

conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-20961](/security/CVE-2018-20961))

It was discovered that the XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly handle mount failures in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-20976](/security/CVE-2018-20976))

It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(Wi-Fi disconnect). ([CVE-2019-0136](/security/CVE-2019-0136))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-10207](/security/CVE-2019-10207))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Linux kernel when

reference counting pages, leading to potential use-after-free issues. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11487](/security/CVE-2019-11487))

It was discovered that the GTCO tablet input driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly bounds check the initial HID report sent by the device. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13631](/security/CVE-2019-13631))

It was discovered that the Raremono AM/FM/SW radio device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly allocate memory, leading to a use-after-free.

A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15211](/security/CVE-2019-15211))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the CPiA2 video4linux

device driver for the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15215](/security/CVE-2019-15215))

It was discovered that the Atheros mobile chipset driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate data in some situations. An attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15926](/security/CVE-2019-15926))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2019-15926
Debian Bug     : 930904

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This updated advisory text mentions the additional non-security
changes and notes the need to install new binary packages.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-9506

    Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen
    discovered a weakness in the Bluetooth pairing protocols, dubbed
    the "KNOB attack".  An attacker that is nearby during pairing
    could use this to weaken the encryption used between the paired
    devices, and then to eavesdrop on and/or spoof communication
    between them.

    This update mitigates the attack by requiring a minimum encryption
    key length of 56 bits.

CVE-2019-11487

    Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE (Filesystem-in-Userspace)
    facility could be used to cause integer overflow in page reference
    counts, leading to a use-after-free.  On a system with sufficient
    physical memory, a local user permitted to create arbitrary FUSE
    mounts could use this for privilege escalation.

    By default, unprivileged users can only mount FUSE filesystems
    through fusermount, which limits the number of mounts created and
    should completely mitigate the issue.

CVE-2019-15211

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the radio-raremono driver that
    could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15212

    The syzkaller tool found that the rio500 driver does not work
    correctly if more than one device is bound to it.  An attacker
    able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-15215

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the cpia2_usb driver that leads
    to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15216

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the yurex driver that leads to
    a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15218

    The syzkaller tool found that the smsusb driver did not validate
    that USB devices have the expected endpoints, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15219

    The syzkaller tool found that a device initialisation error in the
    sisusbvga driver could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An
    attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15220

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in the p54usb driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15221

    The syzkaller tool found that the line6 driver did not validate
    USB devices' maximum packet sizes, which could lead to a heap
    buffer overrun.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15292

    The Hulk Robot tool found missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15538

    Benjamin Moody reported that operations on XFS hung after a
    chgrp command failed due to a disk quota.  A local user on a
    system using XFS and disk quotas could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2019-15666

    The Hulk Robot tool found an incorrect range check in the network
    transformation (xfrm) layer, leading to out-of-bounds memory
    accesses.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15807

    Jian Luo reported that the Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas)
    did not correctly handle failure to discover devices beyond a SAS
    expander.  This could lead to a resource leak and crash (BUG).
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15924

    The Hulk Robot tool found a missing error check in the fm10k
    Ethernet driver, which could lead to a null pointer dereference
    and crash (BUG/oops).  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15926

    It was found that the ath6kl wifi driver did not consistently
    validate traffic class numbers in received control packets,
    leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses.  A nearby attacker on
    the same wifi network could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.189-3~deb8u1.  This version also includes a fix for Debian bug
#930904, and other fixes included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 and linux-latest-4.9
packages.  You will need to use "apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs"
or "apt upgrade" as the binary package names have changed.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
