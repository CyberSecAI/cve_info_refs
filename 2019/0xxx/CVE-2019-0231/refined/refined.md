{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the close_notify SSL/TLS message by the Apache MINA framework.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The server does not close the connection when it receives a close_notify message."
    ],
    "impact": "The server retains the socket open after receiving a close_notify message, which could lead to the client receiving clear-text messages that were intended to be encrypted. This could compromise the confidentiality of data transmitted between the client and server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a close_notify message to the server.",
         "The server fails to properly terminate the connection after receiving a close_notify message, which leaves the server vulnerable."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to establish a connection with the server and be able to send SSL/TLS messages, including the close_notify message."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "All versions prior to MINA 2.1.1 and 2.0.21"
  ],
    "fix_versions": [
        "MINA 2.1.1",
        "MINA 2.0.21"
    ]
