{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Struts framework did not properly protect stack-accessible values of type java.io.File and java.nio.File, as well as other classes from these standard library packages, allowing manipulation of file objects through request parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Access permission override",
      "Improper protection of stack-accessible values"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can manipulate a file upload request to set the working copy of the uploaded file to read-only. Subsequent actions on the file will fail with an error, causing a denial of service. Additionally, the attacker might be able to set the servlet container's temp directory to read-only, causing subsequent upload actions to fail as well.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating file upload requests",
      "Exploiting stack-accessible values exposed through file uploads"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to an Action that exposes a file with a getter.",
    "references": [
      "https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-060"
    ],
      "more_details": "The vulnerability is caused due to a lack of protection against potentially harmful underlying properties when file uploads are performed to an Action that exposes the file with a getter. Prior to Struts 2.5.22, stack-accessible values (e.g. Action properties) of type java.io.File and java.nio.File, as well as other classes from these standard library packages, are not properly protected by the framework to deny access to potentially harmful underlying properties."
