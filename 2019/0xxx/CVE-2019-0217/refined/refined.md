Based on the provided information, here's what can be extracted regarding CVE-2019-0217:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Race condition in `mod_auth_digest` in Apache HTTP Server.

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** A race condition exists in the `mod_auth_digest` module when running in a threaded server configuration.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A user with valid credentials could authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access control restrictions, leading to privilege escalation.

*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker with valid credentials could exploit the race condition.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs valid credentials for at least one user.
    *   The server must be running in a threaded MPM configuration (Note: Red Hat mentions that their httpd package does not ship in threaded MPM configuration by default).

*   **Mitigation:** Using the prefork MPM is an effective mitigation, as the flaw only affects a threaded server configuration.

*   **Affected Components:** `mod_auth_digest`

*   **Affected Products (as per Red Hat):** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Red Hat JBoss Core Services, Red Hat Software Collections.

*   **Affected Products (as per SUSE):** SUSE Enterprise Storage, SUSE Linux Enterprise, SUSE Manager, SUSE OpenStack Cloud, OpenSUSE Leap
