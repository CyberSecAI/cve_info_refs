Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2019-0162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way some microprocessors handle memory access within virtual memory mappings. Specifically, it is related to virtual memory mapping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper memory access control in virtual memory mapping. This can lead to unauthorized information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local access: The attacker must have local access to the system in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the affected system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable microprocessor is running.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

- **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "LOW" severity.
- **CVSS Score:** The CVSS base score is 3.8.
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N which means:
    - **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The vulnerability requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
    - **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** Exploitation is relatively straightforward.
    - **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** The attacker needs low level privileges.
    - **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required for successful exploitation.
    - **S:C (Scope: Changed):** An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component.
    - **C:L (Confidentiality: Low):** There is a low impact on confidentiality if this vulnerability is exploited.
    - **I:N (Integrity: None):** There is no impact to integrity if the vulnerability is exploited.
    - **A:N (Availability: None):** There is no impact on availability if the vulnerability is exploited.
- **Affected Products:** Some Microprocessors with Virtual Memory Mapping are affected.
- **Mitigation:** Intel recommends following existing best practices for mitigating such vulnerabilities and provides links to resources with more details on side-channel resistance and timing side-channel attacks.

This information is consistent with the general description of CVE-2019-0162 as a hardware vulnerability related to information disclosure through memory mapping.
