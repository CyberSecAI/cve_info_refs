Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-0227:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Apache Axis 1.4 due to a hardcoded HTTP URL (`www.xmltoday.com`) in the default `StockQuoteService.jws` example service.
*   The `XMLUtils.newDocument` function, used by the service, makes an HTTP request to this domain to fetch XML data.
*   The function follows redirects which allows an attacker to redirect the request to a malicious URL.
*   Axis treats requests originating from localhost as having administrative privileges, which can be abused to deploy and execute malicious services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The `StockQuoteService.jws` makes an external HTTP request to a hardcoded domain, which can be redirected by an attacker.
*   **Unvalidated Redirect:** The `XMLUtils.newDocument` function blindly follows redirects, making it vulnerable to malicious redirection.
*   **Insecure Handling of Localhost Requests**: Axis grants administrative privileges to requests originating from localhost, allowing attackers to leverage SSRF vulnerabilities for code execution.
*   **Hardcoded URL:** Relying on a hardcoded URL in a default service is a poor security practice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By redirecting the HTTP request to a malicious service on localhost, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the vulnerable server.
*   **Arbitrary JSP Execution:** The attacker can write and execute a JSP file on the server, gaining control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Expired Domain:** If the attacker purchases the expired domain (`www.xmltoday.com`), they can set up a server that redirects requests to a malicious localhost service on the vulnerable Axis server.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** If the attacker is on the same network as the vulnerable server, they can use ARP poisoning to redirect HTTP traffic to their own server, and then redirect the request to localhost to achieve RCE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Expired Domain Purchase:** Ability to purchase the expired domain (`www.xmltoday.com`) (though not needed if using the MITM method).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Apache Axis server for MITM attacks.
*   **MITM Capabilities:**  For the man-in-the-middle approach, the attacker needs to be able to perform ARP poisoning.
*   **Triggering the Vulnerability**: The attacker needs to trigger the HTTP request by sending a request to the `StockQuoteService.jws`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Rhino Security Labs purchased `www.xmltoday.com` to prevent widespread malicious exploitation using the expired domain method.
*   The vulnerability can still be exploited within a local network using MITM attacks.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by requesting the default `StockQuoteService.jws` service.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is available on the RhinoSecurityLabs GitHub repository.
