Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-0164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper permissions** in the installer for the Intel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The core issue is that the installer doesn't set the correct file permissions. This allows a regular user to potentially manipulate files or configurations they should not have access to.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:**  The weakness allows an authenticated local user to gain higher privileges than they should normally possess.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation enables a local user to elevate their privileges, potentially gaining administrative or system-level access.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with elevated privileges could perform various malicious actions on the system.
*   **Compromise:**  The vulnerability could lead to the compromise of system integrity and confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the target machine.
*   **Local access to the system.**
*   **Technical Skills:** Some level of technical expertise might be needed to exploit the vulnerability, manipulating the insecure file permissions or the installer process.
*   **User Interaction:** The CVSS vector indicates "UI:R" meaning user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Intel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 driver version 1.0.0.1035 and all earlier versions.
*   **Mitigation:** Intel has discontinued support for the vulnerable driver and recommends users uninstall it.  The functionality is still available through native OS support (Windows 10 RS5 and later).
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.7 (Medium), with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H which translates to Local Access, High Attack Complexity, Low Privileges Required, User Interaction Required and affects Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
