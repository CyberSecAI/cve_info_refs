Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-0920:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a type confusion condition within the `msado15.dll` library. This occurs when the application misinterprets the data type of an object, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion:** The core weakness is the type confusion flaw in the ADODB library. By manipulating script actions, an attacker can force the system to treat a data type as another, leading to exploitable memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Context of Current Process:** The attacker's code will run within the security context of the current process. This could have significant implications depending on the privileges of the user or application running the vulnerable code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Pages:**  An attacker can host a malicious web page that, when visited by a victim using Internet Explorer, triggers the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Files:**  Alternatively, the attacker could embed the malicious script into a file that, when opened, triggers the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be physically present on the victim's machine. The attack can be performed remotely through the internet or via delivery of malicious files.
- **User Interaction:** The victim has to interact with the malicious content by either visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file for the exploit to work.
