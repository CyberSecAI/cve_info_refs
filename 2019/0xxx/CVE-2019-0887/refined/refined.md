      "type": "Vulnerability",
      "detail": "Path Traversal in Microsoft RDP client's clipboard synchronization feature."
    },
    {
      "type": "Root Cause",
      "detail": "The RDP client does not properly sanitize file paths received from the RDP server during clipboard file transfer operations (specifically when handling the `CF_HDROP` format converted to FileGroupDescriptor (Fgd) format)."
    },
    {
      "type": "Attack Vector",
      "detail": "A malicious RDP server sends a crafted file transfer clipboard content containing path traversal characters (e.g., \"..\\\") to the RDP client. When the user pastes the content, the client stores the malicious file path on the clipboard without proper validation."
    },
    {
      "type": "Impact",
      "detail": "An attacker can write arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the client's file system, limited by the permissions of the client user. This can lead to code execution, for example, by placing a malicious script in the client's Startup folder."

      "detail": "The vulnerability can be exploited in Hyper-V because RDP is used behind the scenes as the control plane for Hyper-V enhanced sessions (which include clipboard synchronization).  An attacker with control of the guest VM can perform a guest-to-host VM escape."
    },
    {
      "type": "Mitigation",
      "detail": "The vulnerability is patched by using the `PathCchCanonicalize` function to convert the path string into a canonical form and validating the filename. The fix involves verifying the structure of the incoming `FileGroupDescriptorW` file formats and calculating the canonicalized form for each filename.  If the canonicalized output doesn't match the original filename, the validity check fails."
