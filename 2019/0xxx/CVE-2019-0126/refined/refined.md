Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-0126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient access control in silicon reference firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper access control mechanisms in the firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential escalation of privilege, allowing a privileged user to gain higher-level access.
- Potential denial of service, disrupting normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a privileged user on the system.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the affected system.

**Affected Products:**
- Intel速 Xeon速 Processor D Family
- Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable Processor

**Summary**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the firmware of specific Intel processors. A local, privileged attacker could exploit this to gain elevated privileges or cause a denial-of-service condition. The provided CVSS vector indicates a high severity due to potential impact on both integrity and availability with the scope change.
