- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect authorization in the HBase REST server. Requests were executed with the permissions of the REST server itself, instead of the permissions of the end-user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization leading to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users of the HBase REST server could perform actions they are not authorized to do, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending requests to the HBase REST server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the HBase REST server, with the vulnerable setup that includes Kerberos authentication, HBase authorization, and SPNEGO authentication for the REST server.
