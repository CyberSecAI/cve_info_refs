{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `JsBuiltInEngineInterfaceExtensionObject::InjectJsBuiltInLibraryCode` method in Microsoft Edge Chakra does not restore the previous status of the disable-implicit-call flag after calling JavaScript code. This can lead to a stack-based use-after-free because setting the flag can prevent stack-allocated objects from leaking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper handling of the disable-implicit-call flag.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A use-after-free can be exploited for denial of service, or potentially to achieve arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting specific JavaScript code to call the vulnerable `InjectJsBuiltInLibraryCode` method and then leak stack-allocated objects.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of Microsoft Edge Chakra."
