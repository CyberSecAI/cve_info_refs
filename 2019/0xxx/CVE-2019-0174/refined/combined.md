### Summary:

A potential security vulnerability in some microprocessors may allow partial information disclosure via local access.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2019-0174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0174)

Description: Logic condition in specific microprocessors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable partial physical address information disclosure via local access.

CVSS Base Score:  3.8 Low

CVSS Vector:  [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

### Affected Products:

Microprocessors:

Intel® Core™ X-series Processors, 4th Generation Intel® Core™ i5 Processors,4th Generation Intel® Core™ i3 Processors, Intel® Pentium® Processor G Series, Intel® Pentium® Processor 3000 Series, Intel® Celeron® Processor 2000 Series, Intel® Xeon® Processor E7 v3 Family, Intel® Xeon® Processor E5 v3 Family, Intel® Xeon® Processor E3 v3 Family.

### Recommendations:

Partial physical address information potentially disclosed through exploitation of this vulnerability does not contain user secrets, but could potentially be utilized to enhance unrelated attack methods.  For published exploits that Intel is aware of, Intel recommends users follow existing best practices including:

The use of DRAM modules resistant to Rowhammer style attacks.
