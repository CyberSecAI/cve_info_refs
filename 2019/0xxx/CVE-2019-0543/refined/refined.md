  "CVE-2019-0543": {
    "description": "Performing an NTLM authentication to the same machine results in a network token which can be used to create arbitrary processes in session 0.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Windows handles loopback NTLM authentication when a SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_EX structure is used with username and domain fields set, but without a password. Instead of returning a token with the same session ID as the caller, it returns a network token with session ID 0.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The returned token has session ID 0, which is typically reserved for system processes and services.",
      "The vulnerability allows a user to obtain a token associated with session 0 by authenticating to itself which can be then used to spawn arbitrary processes in Session 0"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create arbitrary processes in session 0, which can lead to elevation of privileges by modifying global named objects or making it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by performing a loopback NTLM authentication.",
      "By supplying a specific SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_EX structure during authentication, which returns a token associated to session 0."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to initiate a local authentication process.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability might also be exploitable in an AppContainer if the Enterprise Authentication capability is granted. A proof of concept (PoC) is provided as a C# project. The PoC negotiates the network access token set to Session 0 then abuses the COM activator to create a process using that access token."
