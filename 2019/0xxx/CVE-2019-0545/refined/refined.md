  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The SocketsHttpHandler in .NET Core mishandles 1xx (Informational) HTTP responses as if they were final responses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of 1xx responses"
    ],
    "impact": "A cross-origin information disclosure vulnerability. When a client multiplexes requests to different origins onto a single persistent connection, the real final response to the first request can be used as a response for a different request on the same connection. A well-behaved server can also trigger this information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Client multiplexing requests to different origins on a single persistent connection.",
      "A well-behaved server sending 1xx responses."
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send requests that cause the server to send 1xx HTTP responses before the actual final response, and control the client to multiplex requests."
