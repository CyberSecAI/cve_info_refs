Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-0732:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition between the LUAFV (Layered User-Mode Access Filter Verification) driver and the kernel's code signing process. Specifically, the `NtSetCachedSigningLevel` system call can be manipulated by LUAFV.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:**  The core issue is a race condition where the LUAFV driver virtualizes a file after the signing process has read the original file's content for hashing but before the kernel EA (Extended Attribute) is written.
*   **Incorrect File Binding:** The LUAFV driver virtualizes the file underneath the signing process after hashing. This means that while the signature is generated based on the original, signed file (e.g., notepad.exe), the kernel EA is then written to an arbitrary, unsigned file due to the LUAFV virtualization.
*   **Bypass of Code Signing Enforcement:** The vulnerability allows a bypass of code signing enforcement under UMCI (User Mode Code Integrity) with Device Guard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can trick the system into applying a cached signature of a valid Microsoft-signed file to an arbitrary, unsigned file.
*   This allows the attacker to load and execute arbitrary code with an elevated process signature level, circumventing Device Guard and other code signing mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** This is a local exploit, meaning the attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target Windows machine with the ability to execute code.
*   **User Privileges:** The exploit can be triggered by a normal user.
*   **Ability to Create and Manipulate Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create files, copy files, and request delete access on files.

**Detailed Steps of the Exploit:**

1.  **Create a Signed File Copy:** The attacker creates a file with the content of a valid Microsoft-signed file (e.g., `notepad.exe`) in a virtualized location.
2.  **Virtualize the Signed File:** The attacker uses LUAFV to virtualize the signed file by requesting DELETE access. This action does not register as a "write access", and bypasses checks in the signing process.
3.  **Copy Unsigned Executable:** The attacker copies the unsigned executable to the virtual store with the target virtualized name. This step replaces the original, signed content with the attacker's unsigned code, but under the same file path from the kernel's perspective.
4.  **Call `NtSetCachedSigningLevel`:** The attacker calls the `NtSetCachedSigningLevel` system call on the virtualized file with flag `4`.
5.  **Kernel EA Write to Wrong File:** The signing code generates a signature based on the content of the original, signed file. However, before writing the kernel EA (which binds the signature), the LUAFV driver virtualizes the file. The kernel EA, containing the signature, is then written to the attacker's arbitrary unsigned file in the virtual store, effectively signing the attacker's file instead of the original signed file.
6.  **Execution of Unsigned Code:** The attacker can then load the unsigned executable with an elevated process signature level.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit is tested on Windows 10 1809 but not tested on earlier versions.
*   The attacker must use a valid extension file for the original signed file due to the limitation of not being able to virtualize files with executable extensions. After a successful signing, it can be renamed to the desired file extension.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) is in C# and can be used to sign arbitrary DLL files and then map them into memory.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass Device Guard by using LUAFV to manipulate the code signing process to sign an arbitrary unsigned file, allowing execution with elevated signature level.
