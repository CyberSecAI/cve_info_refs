Package        : inetutils
Version        : 2:1.9.4-7+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-0053 CVE-2021-40491 CVE-2022-39028
Debian Bug     : 945861 956084 993476

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in inetutils, a
collection of common network programs.

CVE-2019-0053

    inetutils' telnet client doesn't sufficiently validate environment
    variables, which can lead to stack-based buffer overflows.  This
    issue is limited to local exploitation from restricted shells.

CVE-2021-40491

    inetutils' ftp client before 2.2 does not validate addresses
    returned by PSV/LSPV responses to make sure they match the server
    address.  A malicious server can exploit this flaw to reach services
    in the client's private network.  (This is similar to curl's
    CVE-2020-8284.)

CVE-2022-39028

    inetutils's telnet server through 2.3 has a NULL pointer dereference
    which a client can trigger by sending 0xff 0xf7 or 0xff 0xf8.  In a
    typical installation, the telnetd application would crash but the
    telnet service would remain available through inetd.  However, if the
    telnetd application has many crashes within a short time interval,
    the telnet service would become unavailable after inetd logs a
    "telnet/tcp server failing (looping), service terminated" error.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:1.9.4-7+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your inetutils packages.

For the detailed security status of inetutils please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/inetutils>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : inetutils
Version        : 2:1.9.4-7+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-0053 CVE-2023-40303
Debian Bug     : 945861 1049365

Security issues were discovered in inetutils, a collection of GNU
network utilities, which could lead to privilege escalation or
potentially execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-0053

    Thorsten Alteholz discovered that CVE-2019-0053 was patched
    incorrectly in inetutils 2:1.9.4-7+deb10u3.  The original
    vulnerability remained: inetutils' telnet client doesn't
    sufficiently validate environment variables, which can lead to
    stack-based buffer overflows.  (This issue is limited to local
    exploitation from restricted shells.)

CVE-2023-40303

    Jeffrey Bencteux discovered that several setuid(), setgid(),
    seteuid() and setguid() return values were not checked in ftpd/
    rcp/rlogin/rsh/rshd/uucpd code, which may lead to privilege
    escalation.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:1.9.4-7+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your inetutils packages.

For the detailed security status of inetutils please refer to

FreeBSD-SA-19:12.telnet Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: telnet(1) client multiple vulnerabilities
Category: contrib
Module: contrib/telnet
Announced: 2019-07-24
Credits: Juniper Networks
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2019-07-19 15:37:29 UTC (stable/12, 12.0-STABLE)
2019-07-24 12:51:52 UTC (releng/12.0, 12.0-RELEASE-p8)
2019-07-19 15:27:53 UTC (stable/11, 11.2-STABLE)
2019-07-24 12:51:52 UTC (releng/11.2, 11.2-RELEASE-p12)
2019-07-24 12:51:52 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p1)
CVE Name: CVE-2019-0053
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The telnet(1) command is a TELNET protocol client, used primarily to
establish terminal sessions across a network.
II. Problem Description
Insufficient validation of environment variables in the telnet client
supplied in FreeBSD can lead to stack-based buffer overflows. A stack-
based overflow is present in the handling of environment variables when
connecting via the telnet client to remote telnet servers.
This issue only affects the telnet client. Inbound telnet sessions to
telnetd(8) are not affected by this issue.
III. Impact
These buffer overflows may be triggered when connecting to a malicious
server, or by an active attacker in the network path between the client
and server. Specially crafted TELNET command sequences may cause the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
telnet(1).
IV. Workaround
Do not use telnet(1) to connect to untrusted machines or over an
untrusted network.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:12/telnet.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:12/telnet.patch.asc
# gpg --verify telnet.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
GNU inetutils <= 1.9.4 telnet.c multiple overflows
==================================================
GNU inetutils is vulnerable to a stack overflow vulnerability in the client-side environment
variable handling which can be exploited to escape restricted shells on embedded devices.
Most modern browsers no longer support telnet:// handlers, but in instances where URI
handlers are enabled to the inetutils telnet client this issue maybe remotely triggerable.
A stack-based overflow is present in the handling of environment variables when connecting
telnet.c to remote telnet servers through oversized DISPLAY arguments.

A heap-overflow is also present which can be triggered in a different code path due to
supplying oversized environment variables during client connection code.

The stack-based overflow can be seen in the following code snippet from the latest inetutils
release dated 2015.

inetutils-telnet/inetutils-1.9.4/telnet/telnet.c

983-    case TELOPT_XDISPLOC:
984-      if (my_want_state_is_wont (TELOPT_XDISPLOC))
985-	return;
986-      if (SB_EOF ())
987-	return;
988-      if (SB_GET () == TELQUAL_SEND)
989-	{
990-	  unsigned char temp[50], *dp;
991-	  int len;
992-
993-	  if ((dp = env_getvalue ("DISPLAY")) == NULL)
994-	    {
995-	      /*
996-	       * Something happened, we no longer have a DISPLAY
997-	       * variable.  So, turn off the option.
998-	       */
999-	      send_wont (TELOPT_XDISPLOC, 1);
1000-	      break;
1001-	    }
1002:	  sprintf ((char *) temp, "%c%c%c%c%s%c%c", IAC, SB, TELOPT_XDISPLOC,
1003-		   TELQUAL_IS, dp, IAC, SE);
1004-	  len = strlen ((char *) temp + 4) + 4;	/* temp[3] is 0 ... */
1005-
1006-	  if (len < NETROOM ())

When a telnet server requests environment options the sprintf on line 1002 will
not perform bounds checking and causes an overflow of stack buffer temp[50] defined
at line 990. This issue can be trivially fixed using a patch to add bounds checking
to sprintf such as with a call to snprintf();

An example of the heap overflow can be seen when handling large environment
variables within the telnet client, causing heap buffer memory corruption
through long string supplied in example USER or DISPLAY.

An example of triggering this issue on inetutils in Arch Linux can be seen below:

DISPLAY=`perl -e 'print Ax"50000"'` telnet -l`perl -e 'print "A"x5000'` 192.168.69.1
Trying 192.168.69.1...
Connected to 192.168.69.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
realloc(): invalid next size
Aborted (core dumped)

These issues are present anywhere that inetutils is used as a base for clients
such as in common embedded home routers or networking equipment. An attacker
can potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to gain arbitrary code execution
on platforms where telnet commands are available. An example debug trace of the
heap overflow can be found below:

(gdb) run -l`perl -e 'print "A"x5000'` 192.168.69.1
Starting program: /usr/bin/telnet -l`perl -e 'print "A"x5000'` 192.168.69.1
Trying 192.168.69.1...
Connected to 192.168.69.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
realloc(): invalid next size

#16 0x00005555555592be in ?? ()

Due to the various devices embedding telnet from inetutils and distributions
such as Arch Linux using inetutils telnet, it is unclear the full impact and all
scenarios where this issue could be leveraged. An attacker may seek to exploit
these vulnerabilities to escape restricted shells.

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
