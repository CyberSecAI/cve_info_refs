Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-0552:

*   **Vulnerability:** COM Desktop Broker Privilege Escalation
*   **Root Cause:** The COM Desktop Broker in Windows 10 doesn't correctly check permissions.
*   **Weakness:** Incorrect permission checks in the COM Desktop Broker. The system considers anything not from the store as sideloaded, including inbox applications. Lack of capability checks for broker usage allows sandbox escape even for sideloaded applications. The `IWinRTDesktopBroker` interface's `GetClassActivatorForApplication` method doesn't validate the provided directory path. The `IWinRTClassActivator` interface exposes a managed DCOM object which can be exploited using serialization attacks.
*   **Impact:** Elevation of privilege, Sandbox escape. Arbitrary code execution outside the sandbox.
*   **Attack Vector:** An application can create an instance of the broker's class (C8FFC414-946D-4E61-A302-9B9713F84448). By calling the `GetClassActivatorForApplication` method with an arbitrary directory and then activating a WinRT component within that directory, an attacker can achieve code execution outside of the sandbox.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create a directory, copy a WinRT component, and create an instance of the COM Desktop Broker. For exploitation from Edge, the attacker needs to get into the MicrosoftEdge process (or another process outside of LPAC).

The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) involves injecting a DLL into a running MicrosoftEdge process to demonstrate the issue. The PoC requires knowledge of the `ntdll!LdrpKnownDllDirectoryHandle` symbol location for x64.
