Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-0096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the subsystem of Intel(R) AMT (Active Management Technology).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the presence of an out-of-bounds write, which allows writing to memory locations outside the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to escalation of privilege. Specifically, an authenticated user may gain higher privileges than intended due to the out-of-bounds write.
-The impact is rated as High for Confidentiality and Integrity, and High for Availability with the CVSS:3.0 vector score.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Adjacent network access. The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the network. They do not need physical access but must have valid credentials to the targeted AMT service.
- The attack vector also has a 'High' complexity requirement to be successfully exploited.

**Affected Products:**
- Intel(R) AMT versions before 11.8.65, 11.11.65, 11.22.65, and 12.0.35.

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-0096 is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Intel AMT that, if exploited by an authenticated user via adjacent network access, could allow the attacker to escalate their privileges.
