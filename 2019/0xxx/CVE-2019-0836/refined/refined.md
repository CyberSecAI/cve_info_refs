Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-0836:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a race condition in the LUAFV (Layered User Access Filter Verifier) driver's `LuafvPostReadWrite` callback. This race occurs when delay virtualization happens during a read operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:**  The core issue is a lack of locking in `LuafvPostReadWrite`. If file delay virtualization completes between the `LuafvPreRedirectWithCallback` call and `LuafvPostReadWrite`, the `SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS` and cache from the read-only file will overwrite the top-level file object. This leads to the "real" file being mapped read-write instead of the virtualized one.
- **Insecure File Object Overwriting:** The driver overwrites the file object without verifying if delayed virtualization has occurred. This allows the attacker to manipulate the `SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS` to point to the original file and bypass the intended file virtualization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation (EoP):** A standard user can escalate privileges to system level. By manipulating the file mapping, the attacker can gain write access to files they normally wouldn't be able to modify.
- **Arbitrary File Modification:**  The vulnerability can be used to modify the contents of any file that can be virtualized by the LUAFV driver, potentially leading to system compromise or data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  Exploitation requires local access to the system.
- **File Operations:** The exploit uses specific file operations such as IRP_MJ_READ, IRP_MJ_CREATE, IRP_MJ_SET_EA to trigger the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Standard User Account:** The attacker needs a standard user account with the ability to open, read, and write files.
- **Precise Timing:** The attacker needs to carefully time specific file operations to trigger the race condition, primarily by using oplock mechanisms. The exploit described leverages the `FILE_COMPLETE_IF_OPLOCKED` flag and the behavior of the delayed virtualization process to win the race.

**Additional Notes:**
- This is described as a different root cause than another similar vulnerability (49960) and can be exploited even after the other issue was fixed.
- The provided proof of concept maps the 'license.rtf' file as read-write, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be used for file manipulation.
- The issue is present in Windows 10 1809 but wasn't tested on earlier versions.
- The vulnerability is triggered by accessing a file that is subject to delayed virtualization, and winning the race condition during the read operation.
