Multiple security issues were discovered in the Squid proxy caching
server, which could result in the bypass of security filters, information
disclosure, the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.6-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.

Package        : squid3
Version        : 3.4.8-6+deb8u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12526 CVE-2019-18677 CVE-2019-18678
                 CVE-2019-18679

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by the following security
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2019-12526

     URN response handling in Squid suffers from a heap-based buffer
     overflow. When receiving data from a remote server in response to
     an URN request, Squid fails to ensure that the response can fit
     within the buffer. This leads to attacker controlled data
     overflowing in the heap.

CVE-2019-18677

     When the append_domain setting is used (because the appended
     characters do not properly interact with hostname length
     restrictions), it can inappropriately redirect traffic to origins
     it should not be delivered to. This happens because of incorrect
     message processing.

CVE-2019-18678

     A programming error allows attackers to smuggle HTTP requests
     through frontend software to a Squid instance that splits the HTTP
     Request pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages
     corrupt caches (between a client and Squid) with
     attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs. Effects are isolated
     to software between the attacker client and Squid.
     There are no effects on Squid itself, nor on any upstream servers.
     The issue is related to a request header containing whitespace
     between a header name and a colon.

CVE-2019-18679

     Due to incorrect data management, Squid is vulnerable to
     information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest Authentication.
     Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer that sits
     within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR
     protections and may aid attackers isolating memory areas to target
     for remote code execution attacks.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.4.8-6+deb8u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156328#c0)  Robert Frohl   2019-11-08 15:52:48 UTC  ``` Problem Description:   Due to incorrect message processing Squid configured with  append_domain can inappropriately redirect traffic to origins it  should not be delivered to.  __________________________________________________________________  Severity:   This issue allows attackers to hide origin servers for phishing  attacks or malware download URLs.   This issue is restricted to proxies with append_domain  configured. It is relatively easy for attackers to probe and  determine whether a target network proxy has this directive  along with its value.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.9.   In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable  releases can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 3.5:  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-e5f1813a674848dde570f7920873e1071f96e0b4.patch>>  Squid 4:  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-36492033ea4097821a4f7ff3ddcb971fbd1e8ba0.patch>>   If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:   All Squid without append_domain configured are not vulnerable.   All Squid-2.x up to and including 2.7.STABLE9 with append_domain  configured are vulnerable.  All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 with append_domain  configured are vulnerable.  All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.8 with append_domain  configured are vulnerable.   To determine whether append_domain is configured use the command:   squid -k parse | grep append_domain  __________________________________________________________________  Workarounds:   Remove append_domain configuration settings from squid.conf.   The append_domain feature is redundant when /etc/resolv.conf  is used to determine hostnames. However, please note that use  of /etc/resolv.conf may require removal of dns_nameservers and  other redundant DNS directives.   <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_9.txt> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18677> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1156328#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-08 17:00:21 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1156328) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/746661> Factory / squid ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156328#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-14 20:15:19 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:2975-1: An update that fixes 12 vulnerabilities is now available.

The domain in a URL must obey hostname length restrictions after

append\_domain is applied, not just MAX\_URL for the normalized

absolute-URL.

Sorry, something went wrong.

1. Please avoid code duplication.
2. Please do not give the end user the ability to flood cache.log with useless level-1 messages. If you insist on logging something at level 1, then add a logging limit (e.g., increase the level after the first 10 level-1 messages).
3. Please do not change `!strchr()` "not there" mnemonic to a lot less intuitive `strchr() == 0`. The latter comparison with zero is good for strcmp() but not for strchr().

Sorry, something went wrong.

Debian Bug     : 950802 931478 950925 912294

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by multiple security vulnerabilities.
Due to incorrect input validation and URL request handling it was
possible to bypass access restrictions for restricted HTTP servers
and to cause a denial-of-service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.23-5+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

For the detailed security status of squid3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2019:9
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2019:9
Date: November 05, 2019
Summary: Cross-Site Request Forgery issue
in HTTP Request processing.
Affected versions: Squid 2.x -> 2.7.STABLE9
Squid 3.x -> 3.5.28
Squid 4.x -> 4.8
Fixed in version: Squid 4.9
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019\_9.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18677
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to incorrect message processing Squid configured with
append\_domain can inappropriately redirect traffic to origins it
should not be delivered to.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
This issue allows attackers to hide origin servers for phishing
attacks or malware download URLs.
This issue is restricted to proxies with append\_domain
configured. It is relatively easy for attackers to probe and
determine whether a target network proxy has this directive
along with its value.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.9.
In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable
releases can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3.5:
Squid 4:
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid without append\_domain configured are not vulnerable.
All Squid-2.x up to and including 2.7.STABLE9 with append\_domain
configured are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 with append\_domain
configured are vulnerable.
All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.8 with append\_domain
configured are vulnerable.
To determine whether append\_domain is configured use the command:
squid -k parse | grep append\_domain
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
Remove append\_domain configuration settings from squid.conf.
The append\_domain feature is redundant when /etc/resolv.conf
is used to determine hostnames. However, please note that use
of /etc/resolv.conf may require removal of dns\_nameservers and
other redundant DNS directives.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If your install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is your
primary support point. For subscription details see
.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed
list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports
are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-0b16cbdd0e
2019-12-05 01:09:44.879358
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 4.9
Release : 2.fc30
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-9538783033
2019-12-05 01:39:12.688383
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 4.9
Release : 2.fc31
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.
