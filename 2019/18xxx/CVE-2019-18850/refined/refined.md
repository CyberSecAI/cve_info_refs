**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to prevent fingerprinting in TrevorC2 versions 1.1 and 1.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent HTTP Response Headers:**  A discrepancy in response headers occurs when different HTTP methods are used.
*   **Predictable Responses:** The server provides predictable responses when accessing and interacting with the "SITE\_PATH\_QUERY".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Also, by interacting with specific parameters like "SITE\_PATH\_QUERY" in a predictable manner.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a TrevorC2 server.
*   The attacker does not appear to require any specific authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered to be of "Moderate severity".
