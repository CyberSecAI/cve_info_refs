Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-18956

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of data within the `prepareError` method of the `com.divisait.dv2ee.controller.MVCControllerServlet` class. This method deserializes the content of the "proxia-error" cookie without proper sanitization, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The application uses `ObjectInputStream` to deserialize data from a cookie without any validation or sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the content of the `proxia-error` cookie, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on the server where the vulnerable application is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious serialized Java object, base64 encode it, compress it with GZIP, and then set it as the value of the `proxia-error` cookie in an HTTP request to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the affected application and set cookie values.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:
```java
  private void prepareError(Mapping mapping, MultipartRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  {
    String errorAction = HttpUtils.getCookie(request, "proxia-error");
    HttpUtils.clearSessionCookie(request, response, "proxia-error");
    if (errorAction == null) {
      return;
    }
    try
    {
      Base64 b64 = new Base64();
      byte[] message = b64.decode(errorAction);
      ObjectInputStream serin = new ObjectInputStream(new GZIPInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(message)));

      HashMap<String, Serializable> toReturn = (HashMap)serin.readObject();
      serin.close();
      if (!toReturn.isEmpty())
      {
        Iterator<?> key = toReturn.keySet().iterator();
        while (key.hasNext())
        {
          String entry = (String)key.next();
          Object data = toReturn.get(entry);
          request.setAttribute(entry, data);
        }
      }
    }
    catch (Exception e) {}
  }
```
The vulnerability lies in the lines where `ObjectInputStream` is used to read the data from the cookie:
```java
      byte[] message = b64.decode(errorAction);
      ObjectInputStream serin = new ObjectInputStream(new GZIPInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(message)));
      HashMap<String, Serializable> toReturn = (HashMap)serin.readObject();
```
The provided exploit script (`CVE-2019-18956.sh`) utilizes ysoserial to generate a malicious serialized payload, then sets the encoded and compressed payload as the `proxia-error` cookie.
