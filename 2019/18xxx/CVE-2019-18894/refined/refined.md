The provided content discusses CVE-2019-18894 in the context of a broader analysis of vulnerabilities found in Avast Secure Browser.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `SWITCH_TO_SAFEZONE` command of the Avast Antivirus application's local web server. This command is used to initiate Banking Mode in the browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The `SWITCH_TO_SAFEZONE` command does not properly sanitize the website address parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary command line flags.
- Local web server communication: The Avast Online Security extension and Video Downloader extension communicate with the Avast Antivirus application through a local web server, exposing the vulnerable `SWITCH_TO_SAFEZONE` command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Attackers can inject command line flags into the `AvastBrowser.exe` process via the vulnerable command, leading to arbitrary code execution with user privileges.
- System compromise: By injecting the `--utility-cmd-prefix` flag, the attacker can specify an arbitrary executable to run when the browser starts in Banking Mode. This can lead to malware installation and complete system compromise.
- Bypassing Browser Isolation: Despite Banking Mode being designed as an isolated instance, the vulnerability allows the regular browser instance to compromise it via the injected command.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `SWITCH_TO_SAFEZONE` command, which can be triggered by a compromised browser extension (like the Video Downloader extension). The Video Downloader extension was vulnerable to CVE-2019-18893, where any website could inject code into the extension context. That injected code could then use the described command injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the context of a browser extension that can communicate with the Avast Antivirus application's local web server.
- This is achievable through the previously mentioned vulnerability in Video Downloader (CVE-2019-18893) where a website could inject code into the extension's context.
-  Alternatively, a compromised extension of Avast Secure Browser could achieve this as well.
