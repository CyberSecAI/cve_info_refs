| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-07-08 11:49:48 UTC  ``` This is somewhat related to [bug 821267](show_bug.cgi?id=821267 "RESOLVED FIXED"). We noticed that autoyast2 passes the `--gpg-auto-import-keys` option to zypper unconditionally in src/modules/AutoinstSoftware.rb createImage(). This means that any untrusted repository keys encountered by zypper will be accepted.  Depending on the `media_url` used (in case of http) this may allow a man in the middle to serve more or less arbitrary repositories signed with their own PGP keys.  The original use case for this feature seems to have been to allow unattended installations where some custom repositories are involved (fate#307087). We think the proper way to do that would be to specify the additionally trusted repository keys (their IDs and fingerprints) in the autoyast XML configuration and only trust them explicitly during installation. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c2)  Stefan Schubert   2019-07-24 09:33:14 UTC  ``` As far I see these calls will be used in the AutoYaST configuration module only. (Not during an installation). It is around handling/installing/creating Images which speed ups installation. I have tried to run it but without success.  It is a quite old undocumented feature. I have only found an example:  <software>     <image>       <image_location><http://taylor/></image_location>       <image_name>uwe</image_name>       <script_location>file:///tmp/fetch_image.sh</script_location>       <script_params config:type="list">         <listentry><http://taylor//uwe.tar.gz></listentry>       </script_params>       <run_kickoff config:type="boolean">true</run_kickoff>     </image>     <instsource><http://taylor/11.2_install_i586/DVD1/></instsource>     <patterns config:type="list">       <pattern>apparmor_opt</pattern>       <pattern>base</pattern>       <pattern>yast2_install_wf</pattern>       <pattern>sw_management</pattern>       <pattern>apparmor</pattern>     </patterns>     <packages config:type="list">       <package>kernel-default</package>     </packages>   </software>  and a funny string:  "Here you can choose to use Novell pre-defined images to speed up RPM installation."  I have doubts that this feature has been used by any user in the last 5 years because it is undocumented and at least for me not really understandable.  Lukas, do you have more information about it ? For me it is a candidate for dropping it. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c3)  Lukas Ocilka   2019-07-24 12:33:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c0)) > We > think the proper way to do that would be to specify the additionally trusted > repository keys (their IDs and fingerprints) in the autoyast XML > configuration > and only trust them explicitly during installation.  That would be IMO a feature request  (In reply to Stefan Schubert from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c2)) > I have doubts that this feature has been used by any user in the last 5 > years because it is undocumented and at least for me not really > understandable.  > Lukas, do you have more information about it ? For me it is a candidate for > dropping it.  I don't have any more information about it either. I've never seen anyone using it (well, reporting a bug, requesting an enhancement, etc.). And it's undocumented, so really a candidate to kill. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-07-29 11:18:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to locilka@suse.com from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c3)) > (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c0)) > > We > > think the proper way to do that would be to specify the additionally trusted > > repository keys (their IDs and fingerprints) in the autoyast XML > > configuration > > and only trust them explicitly during installation. >  > That would be IMO a feature request  Well security is not especially keen to have that feature, we'd just like to have things safe, that said ...  > I don't have any more information about it either. > I've never seen anyone using it (well, reporting a bug, requesting an > enhancement, etc.). > And it's undocumented, so really a candidate to kill.  ... killing it would even be safer :-) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c5)  Stefan Schubert   2019-08-09 14:31:54 UTC  ``` Added to our Trello board ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c6)  Alexander Bergmann   2019-12-04 15:44:40 UTC  ``` @Stefan, what's the status here? We have an autoyast2 update in the pipeline and would like to fix this as well. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c7)  Lukas Ocilka   2019-12-05 09:22:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alexander Bergmann from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c6)) > @Stefan, what's the status here? We have an autoyast2 update in the pipeline > and would like to fix this as well.  We haven't planned for this yet. It's just a P3 BTW. IMO, dropping the feature should be done in new products only and well tested.  It's a feature that - is undocumented - nobody uses - creates images that are no longer used anyway (AFAIK)  So, looks like a dead code. Is there any real need for removing that code now? Or is that just because you have another AY patch to be released soon?  PS: We plan AY refactoring, such code-drop could be part of it. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 10:02:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to locilka@suse.com from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c7)) > We haven't planned for this yet.

It's dead code but removing it should be well tested? So AutoinstSoftwareClass.createImage() is dead code?  To solve this bug from a security perspective all that would need to be done is removing those three occurences of `--gpg-auto-import-keys` and if you think it's not used anyways then this should be very low risk.  Zypper and the repository infrastructure are at the core of the distribution security and having code around that auto import's GPG keys should not be taken lightly, be it supposedly dead, or not. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c10)  Lukas Ocilka   2020-03-04 20:48:39 UTC  ``` [Comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c7) still applies. P3 == Basically no chance to get changed. I'm sorry.  I've added this to the planned AutoYaST refactoring/cleanup task. Planned for ~SLE 15 SP3 ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2020-03-09 10:51:08 UTC  ``` We'll use CVE-2019-18905 to track this. CRD is 2020-06-08 as per our policy, but from our POV we can make it public right away, since we will not try to get this fixed in old products and are fine with it being removed in 15.3  Standard disclaimer: This issue will be handled according to our disclosure policy outlined in [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_disclosure_policy](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ASecurity_disclosure_policy)  The information listed here is not public. Please - do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - do not make this bug public  In accordance with our policy we will make this issue public latest at Internal CRD: 2020-06-08 or earlier This is the latest possible date and we prefer to make it public earlier if the situation allows it. In that case we'll post a comment here setting the new date.  Only a member of the security team is allowed to make this issue public. Please speak to us if you want to take part in  the public disclosure.  In doubt please talk to us on IRC (#security) or send us a mail (security@suse.de). ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c12)  Lukas Ocilka   2020-03-09 11:10:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 832246](attachment.cgi?id=832246 "AutoYaST: Installation from images") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=832246&action=edit "AutoYaST: Installation from images") AutoYaST: Installation from images  Here's where you can see it "in action". The screenshot comes from 15.1 and it's behavior is actually broken, radio-buttons do not work as expected. In fact, the feature can't be used at all. No reports about that so far. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c13)  Lukas Ocilka   2020-03-09 11:21:26 UTC  ``` Alexander, the AutoYaST configuration (on a running system) offers functionality that pretends to allow for creating pre-configured images for "installation from images". This feature does not work in UI and Security Team has found a potential security issue (if the UI actually worked) in the code.  What should we do and in which SPs? E.g., we still have time to remove this from SLE 15 SP2, especially as there are no images created by SUSE and the UI for creating images is broken anyway (looks like last change was in 2016). ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c14)  Alexander Herzig   2020-03-09 13:50:26 UTC  ``` Hi Lukas, I would like to see this being addressed in 15SP2. Although it is 'dead code' I understand it is still a valid vulnerability as per [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c7) of Matthias.  If 'removing those three occurrences of `--gpg-auto-import-keys`  is sufficient for security', we should do this for SP2.  Please also look into 15:GA and 15SP1.  A proper refactoring for SP3 can then be done. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c15)  Lukas Ocilka   2020-03-09 14:30:40 UTC  ``` OK, I'll ask to team to remove those calls.  SLE 15 SP3 should IMO remove the whole image creation UI. It's too late for SP2 now. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c16)  Stefan Schubert   2020-03-10 10:38:11 UTC  ``` I have submitted the patches: SLE 15 SP2: <https://github.com/yast/yast-autoinstallation/pull/570> <https://build.suse.de/request/show/213516>  SLE 15 GA: <https://github.com/yast/yast-autoinstallation/pull/571> SR: 213522  SLE15 SP1: <https://github.com/yast/yast-autoinstallation/pull/572> SR: 213529 ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c25)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-05-22 22:30:40 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0676-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has 6 fixes is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c0)  Sasi Olin   2018-09-21 14:21:25 UTC  ``` Space-saving measure, would also allow for finally completing YaST's icon theme, considering it uses icons from other themes (all the package_ icons). yast-theme would still exist for external YaST modules that aren't in-house and can't be adapted. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c1)  Arvin Schnell   2018-09-24 10:29:30 UTC  ``` From my point of view this would defeat the purpose of themes. The theme package can be different e.g. per product. If the icons would be included in the individual packages all those 100 packages would need modifications instead of the one theme package. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c2)  Sasi Olin   2018-09-24 10:54:08 UTC  ``` It's not like YaST themes, apart from hicolor, are maintained anyway, and that issue you are mentioning is valid for every single icon theme trying to maintain compatibility with YaST will have to do sooner or later. I would understand the concern if there existed a version of Breeze icon theme apart from YaST hicolor, but it doesn't. Actually, the current scheme makes it harder to create YaST icon theme, because yast-theme contains icons that are no longer used, and it's not clear which icons YaST actually uses. Putting all required icons within modules will make it clear which icons are used for which module, and depending on either it's actually being used in an active module and doesn't happen to show up in depreciated module, it can be added to a theme. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c3)  Sasi Olin   2018-09-29 00:24:30 UTC  ``` Asking Noah, who is working on YaST Breeze icons about supportability of YaST themes as is. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c4)  Noah Davis   2018-09-29 01:12:44 UTC  ``` As someone who is making KDE Breeze icons for YaST, I agree with Stasiek for a couple main reasons.  1. It would help us eliminate icons we no longer need, which removes uncertainty about whether or not some the work we're doing is a waste of time.  2. It would discourage inappropriate reuse of existing YaST icons and hopefully encourage the use of icons that are included with most themes. Some icons are reused in ways that don't make a lot of sense. Some YaST modules use icons that once belonged to a module that is now long gone, but the name of the icon stayed the same. That makes it more difficult to figure out what modules use what icons. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c5)  Ladislav Slezák   2018-10-04 10:08:55 UTC  ``` I think this needs some broader discussion as each approach has some advantages and disadvantages.  Theme packages:  + Easy to change the look globally with a single package (SLE vs. openSUSE theme) + No icon duplication, the icons can be shared easily - Hard to maintain for designers, unused icons cannot be easily found, names might not match   Bundled icons in YaST:  + No unused icons, proper names - How to share the icons? How to update the same icon used in several modules? - How to make styling for 3rd party distributions easy? (Think about Novell/Microfocus Open Enterprise Server based on SUSE Enterprise Server but with different branding)   I think this should be discussed in <https://features.opensuse.org/> or probably  better at yast-devel ML (<https://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/>) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c6)  Sasi Olin   2018-10-04 12:58:32 UTC  ``` Answered basically the same thing in [https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1110236#c2](show_bug.cgi?id=1110236#c2 "RESOLVED FEATURE - Schematize YaST icons' names") ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-12-04 14:10:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1109310) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/653861> Factory / patterns-kde ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1109310#c15)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-05-22 22:30:27 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0676-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has 6 fixes is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-07-08 11:49:48 UTC  ``` This is somewhat related to [bug 821267](show_bug.cgi?id=821267 "RESOLVED FIXED"). We noticed that autoyast2 passes the `--gpg-auto-import-keys` option to zypper unconditionally in src/modules/AutoinstSoftware.rb createImage(). This means that any untrusted repository keys encountered by zypper will be accepted.  Depending on the `media_url` used (in case of http) this may allow a man in the middle to serve more or less arbitrary repositories signed with their own PGP keys.  The original use case for this feature seems to have been to allow unattended installations where some custom repositories are involved (fate#307087). We think the proper way to do that would be to specify the additionally trusted repository keys (their IDs and fingerprints) in the autoyast XML configuration and only trust them explicitly during installation. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c2)  Stefan Schubert   2019-07-24 09:33:14 UTC  ``` As far I see these calls will be used in the AutoYaST configuration module only. (Not during an installation). It is around handling/installing/creating Images which speed ups installation. I have tried to run it but without success.  It is a quite old undocumented feature. I have only found an example:  <software>     <image>       <image_location><http://taylor/></image_location>       <image_name>uwe</image_name>       <script_location>file:///tmp/fetch_image.sh</script_location>       <script_params config:type="list">         <listentry><http://taylor//uwe.tar.gz></listentry>       </script_params>       <run_kickoff config:type="boolean">true</run_kickoff>     </image>     <instsource><http://taylor/11.2_install_i586/DVD1/></instsource>     <patterns config:type="list">       <pattern>apparmor_opt</pattern>       <pattern>base</pattern>       <pattern>yast2_install_wf</pattern>       <pattern>sw_management</pattern>       <pattern>apparmor</pattern>     </patterns>     <packages config:type="list">       <package>kernel-default</package>     </packages>   </software>  and a funny string:  "Here you can choose to use Novell pre-defined images to speed up RPM installation."  I have doubts that this feature has been used by any user in the last 5 years because it is undocumented and at least for me not really understandable.  Lukas, do you have more information about it ? For me it is a candidate for dropping it. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c3)  Lukas Ocilka   2019-07-24 12:33:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c0)) > We > think the proper way to do that would be to specify the additionally trusted > repository keys (their IDs and fingerprints) in the autoyast XML > configuration > and only trust them explicitly during installation.

For me it is a candidate for > dropping it.  I don't have any more information about it either. I've never seen anyone using it (well, reporting a bug, requesting an enhancement, etc.). And it's undocumented, so really a candidate to kill. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-07-29 11:18:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to locilka@suse.com from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c3)) > (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c0)) > > We > > think the proper way to do that would be to specify the additionally trusted > > repository keys (their IDs and fingerprints) in the autoyast XML > > configuration > > and only trust them explicitly during installation. >  > That would be IMO a feature request  Well security is not especially keen to have that feature, we'd just like to have things safe, that said ...  > I don't have any more information about it either. > I've never seen anyone using it (well, reporting a bug, requesting an > enhancement, etc.). > And it's undocumented, so really a candidate to kill.  ... killing it would even be safer :-) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c5)  Stefan Schubert   2019-08-09 14:31:54 UTC  ``` Added to our Trello board ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c6)  Alexander Bergmann   2019-12-04 15:44:40 UTC  ``` @Stefan, what's the status here? We have an autoyast2 update in the pipeline and would like to fix this as well. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c7)  Lukas Ocilka   2019-12-05 09:22:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alexander Bergmann from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c6)) > @Stefan, what's the status here? We have an autoyast2 update in the pipeline > and would like to fix this as well.  We haven't planned for this yet. It's just a P3 BTW. IMO, dropping the feature should be done in new products only and well tested.  It's a feature that - is undocumented - nobody uses - creates images that are no longer used anyway (AFAIK)  So, looks like a dead code. Is there any real need for removing that code now? Or is that just because you have another AY patch to be released soon?  PS: We plan AY refactoring, such code-drop could be part of it. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 10:02:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to locilka@suse.com from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c7)) > We haven't planned for this yet. It's just a P3 BTW.

It's dead code but removing it should be well tested? So AutoinstSoftwareClass.createImage() is dead code?  To solve this bug from a security perspective all that would need to be done is removing those three occurences of `--gpg-auto-import-keys` and if you think it's not used anyways then this should be very low risk.  Zypper and the repository infrastructure are at the core of the distribution security and having code around that auto import's GPG keys should not be taken lightly, be it supposedly dead, or not. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c10)  Lukas Ocilka   2020-03-04 20:48:39 UTC  ``` [Comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c7) still applies. P3 == Basically no chance to get changed. I'm sorry.  I've added this to the planned AutoYaST refactoring/cleanup task. Planned for ~SLE 15 SP3 ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2020-03-09 10:51:08 UTC  ``` We'll use CVE-2019-18905 to track this. CRD is 2020-06-08 as per our policy, but from our POV we can make it public right away, since we will not try to get this fixed in old products and are fine with it being removed in 15.3  Standard disclaimer: This issue will be handled according to our disclosure policy outlined in [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_disclosure_policy](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ASecurity_disclosure_policy)  The information listed here is not public. Please - do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - do not make this bug public  In accordance with our policy we will make this issue public latest at Internal CRD: 2020-06-08 or earlier This is the latest possible date and we prefer to make it public earlier if the situation allows it. In that case we'll post a comment here setting the new date.  Only a member of the security team is allowed to make this issue public. Please speak to us if you want to take part in  the public disclosure.  In doubt please talk to us on IRC (#security) or send us a mail (security@suse.de). ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c12)  Lukas Ocilka   2020-03-09 11:10:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 832246](attachment.cgi?id=832246 "AutoYaST: Installation from images") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=832246&action=edit "AutoYaST: Installation from images") AutoYaST: Installation from images  Here's where you can see it "in action". The screenshot comes from 15.1 and it's behavior is actually broken, radio-buttons do not work as expected. In fact, the feature can't be used at all. No reports about that so far. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c13)  Lukas Ocilka   2020-03-09 11:21:26 UTC  ``` Alexander, the AutoYaST configuration (on a running system) offers functionality that pretends to allow for creating pre-configured images for "installation from images". This feature does not work in UI and Security Team has found a potential security issue (if the UI actually worked) in the code.  What should we do and in which SPs? E.g., we still have time to remove this from SLE 15 SP2, especially as there are no images created by SUSE and the UI for creating images is broken anyway (looks like last change was in 2016). ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c14)  Alexander Herzig   2020-03-09 13:50:26 UTC  ``` Hi Lukas, I would like to see this being addressed in 15SP2. Although it is 'dead code' I understand it is still a valid vulnerability as per [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c7) of Matthias.  If 'removing those three occurrences of `--gpg-auto-import-keys`  is sufficient for security', we should do this for SP2.  Please also look into 15:GA and 15SP1.  A proper refactoring for SP3 can then be done. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c15)  Lukas Ocilka   2020-03-09 14:30:40 UTC  ``` OK, I'll ask to team to remove those calls.  SLE 15 SP3 should IMO remove the whole image creation UI. It's too late for SP2 now. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c16)  Stefan Schubert   2020-03-10 10:38:11 UTC  ``` I have submitted the patches: SLE 15 SP2: <https://github.com/yast/yast-autoinstallation/pull/570> <https://build.suse.de/request/show/213516>  SLE 15 GA: <https://github.com/yast/yast-autoinstallation/pull/571> SR: 213522  SLE15 SP1: <https://github.com/yast/yast-autoinstallation/pull/572> SR: 213529 ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1140711#c25)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-05-22 22:30:40 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0676-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has 6 fixes is now available.
