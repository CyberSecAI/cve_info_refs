Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18684:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists within the `sudo` command between the process of determining a user ID (uid) and the subsequent `setresuid` and `openat` system calls. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the fact that after the uid is checked (likely to be changed to the target user), sudo opens the file `/etc/sudoers` on file descriptor 3. There's a window of time between when this descriptor is created and when it is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The primary weakness is a race condition. An attacker can exploit this window by writing to file descriptor 3 of the `sudo` process at a specific time.
- **File Descriptor Write Access:** The vulnerability requires an attacker to have write access to file descriptor 3 of the `sudo` process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local user to escalate their privileges to root. This is achieved by modifying the `/etc/sudoers` file to grant the attacker's user the ability to execute any command as root without requiring a password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- **Arbitrary File Descriptor Write:** The attacker needs a method for arbitrary file descriptor writing (this is not directly present in the `sudo` command and hence requires an additional vulnerability).
- **Timing:** The attack relies on precise timing to win the race condition and write to the file descriptor before `sudo` uses it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system where `sudo` is running.
- **Write Access to Sudo's FD:** An attacker needs to have the ability to write to an arbitrary file descriptor, specifically file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This is the main challenge of exploiting this race condition, as described in the comments.
- **Knowledge of Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the arbitrary write at a specific time within the race window.
- **Sudo Prompts for Password:** This vulnerability is triggered when sudo is prompting for a password.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided script uses `pgrep` to find the process ID of `sudo` and then attempts to write to the file descriptor within `/proc`.
- The vulnerability is described as being present in sudo versions through 1.8.29.
- The vulnerability relies on an additional vulnerability in order to have write access to a specific file descriptor.
- The file descriptor 3 does not always refer to `/etc/sudoers`, as commented by `adsnjhfyeqw231eas`, further complicating the exploitation of this vulnerability.
