I see MITRE assigned [CVE-2019-18684](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h9q8-53pc-hhxf "CVE-2019-18684") to this.

I am not sure what the vulnerability is:

* the provided trace is about sudo run as root (not as an unprivileged user)
* `/proc/`pgrep sudo`/fd/` would be restricted to root because the sudo binary is setuid
* fd 3 is not static so if pre-opened, open(2) would return another one

Consequently it seems this is only exploitable if the attacker is already root.

Can you clarify?

Sorry, something went wrong.

It's only viable if you can write to fd/3. So you'll need to pair it with something else that has arbitrary write to any file descriptor.

Since fd/3 is just a symbolic link to /etc/sudoers I don't see how you could write to it unless you have sufficient privileges to write to /etc/sudoers. In which case, what's the point?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Apart from the issue of not having write access to fd/\*, fd/3 does not necessarily points to /etc/sudoers because it depends on the sudo command we are passing before running echo "ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /proc/`pgrep sudo`/fd/3.

In my test environment, I had:

[test@abcdefg ~]$ sudo ls -l /proc/11730/fd

total 0

lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 0 -> /dev/pts/1

lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 1 -> /dev/pts/1

lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 10 -> 'anon\_inode:[eventfd]'

lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 11 -> 'socket:[11557214]'

lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 2 -> /dev/pts/1

lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 3 -> /var/lib/sss/mc/passwd

lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 4 -> 'socket:[11556811]'

lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 5 -> /etc/sudoers

lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 6 -> /var/lib/sss/mc/initgroups

lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 7 -> /var/lib/sss/mc/group

lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 8 -> /run/sudo/ts/test

lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Nov 12 00:41 9 -> 'socket:[11556818]'

where fd/5 points to /etc/sudoers, the poc did not work for me.

Sorry, something went wrong.

## Description

Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to root if they have write access to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This occurs because of a race condition between determining a uid, and the setresuid and openat system calls. The attacker can write "ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" to /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for a password.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
