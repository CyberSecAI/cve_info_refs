- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of CSRF protection in Online Grading System 1.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick an administrator into executing arbitrary code through a specially crafted HTML page. This could lead to unauthorized actions within the application, as demonstrated by adding a new user to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, performs actions on the vulnerable application without the administrator's consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page that an authenticated administrator will visit while still logged into the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable application.
