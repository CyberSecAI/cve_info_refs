## (0Day) WECON PLC Editor PLCDataCeter Port Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-19-1034ZDI-CAN-9123

| CVE ID | [CVE-2019-18236](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-18236) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [WECON](http://www.we-con.com.cn/en/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | PLC Editor |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of WECON PLC Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of WCP files. A crafted Port element in a WCP file can trigger an overflow of a fixed-length buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with ZDI policies.  08/08/2019 - ZDI reported the Vulnerability to ICS-CERT08/14/2019 - ICS-CERT acknowledged the report and provided an ICS-VU#12/13/2019 - ZDI requested any available update12/18/2019 - ZDI advised ICS-CERT of the intention to publish the report as 0-day on 12/30/2019  -- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the application. |
