CVE-2019-18889:
  - Vulnerability: Unsafe cache serialization in Symfony could enable Remote Code Execution (RCE).
  - Root cause: When an instance of TagAwareAdapter is destructed, Symfony executes callables stored in private properties in order to invalidate tags. If the instance has been created by unserializing an external payload, those properties are not checked, leading to RCE.
  - Affected versions: Symfony 3.4.0 to 3.4.34, 4.2.0 to 4.2.11, and 4.3.0 to 4.3.7.
  - Fix: Serialization and unserialization of AbstractAdapter and TagAwareAdapter is now forbidden.
  - Attack vector: By unserializing an external payload, an attacker could trigger the execution of arbitrary code.
