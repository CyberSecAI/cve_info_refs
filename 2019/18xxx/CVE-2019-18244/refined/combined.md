* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** United States

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

William Knowles, Senior Security Consultant at Applied Risk, working with OSIsoft, reported vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

**--------- Begin Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------**

OSIsoft provides the following security updates to mitigate the reported vulnerabilities:

OSIsoft reports further action should be taken after applying the security updates. Remove PI Asset Framework (AF) Client .NET 3.5 after verifying OSIsoft products that include the PI AF Client, such as PI ProcessBook, PI DataLink and other PI System desktop applications have been upgraded to 2015 (as well as later versions) in order to eliminate exposure to CVE-2020-10608.

For PI System servers and interface nodes that are normally unattended, limit console and remote desktop logon access to authorized administrators.

Individual updates for core PI System components are available. Additionally, the following OSIsoft product installation kits have been re-released to automatically deliver the updated components:

**Client**

* PI DataLink
* PI OLEDB Enterprise
* PI OLEDB Provider
* PI ProcessBook
* PI System Management Tools

**Server**

* PB Migration Utility
* PI Event Frames Generator
* PI Interface Configuration Utility
* PI OPC DA Server
* PI Vision
* PI to OCS
* RtReports

**Connectors**

* PI Connector for BACnet
* PI Connector for DC Systems Rtscada
* PI Connector for Ethernet IP
* PI Connector for IEC 60870-5-104
* PI Connector for OPC UA
* PI Connector for Ping
* PI Connector for SIMATIC PCS 7
* PI Connector for Wonderware Historian

OSIsoft reports not all products have been rebundled to include the affected update.

Contact OSIsoft support for guidance on products missing that use affected components that are missing from the currently available releases.

**--------- End Update A Part 2 of 2 ---------**

**CVE-2020-10610**—Manage permissions on HKLM\Software\PISystem and HKLM\WOW6432Node\Software\PISystem registry keys to block a high impact exploit path. See OSIsoft customer portal knowledge article [PI System Registry Security Recommendations](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=000026046) for details on setting registry permissions.

**CVE-2019-18244**—Provision and use domain Group Managed Service Accounts or use the default NetworkService account to run PI Vision AppPools. There is no exposure to this vulnerability when using either of these account types. To limit exposure in case standard domain account is used to run PI Vision AppPools, remove the password entry from the setup log files immediately.

OSIsoft reports the following measures can be used to lower likelihood of exploitation:

**CVE-2020-10610, CVE-2020-10608, CVE-2020-10606**—Migrate standard users to PI Vision and browser-based access to PI System data.

**CVE-2020-10608**—Restrict network connections from PI client workstations to trusted AF servers (TCP Port 5457).

**CVE-2020-10606**—Disable unused PI Buffering services from PI client workstations (PI Buffer Subsystem, PI Buffer Server).

**CVE-2019-10768, CVE-2020-10600, CVE-2020-10614**—Limit write access to PI Vision displays to trusted users.

The following measures can be used to lower the potential impact of exploitation:

**CVE-2020-10610 and CVE-2020-10608**—Deploy application whitelisting solutions with enforcement for approved DLLs:

* [Windows AppLocker](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=KB00994)
* [Windows Defender Application Control](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=KB01892)
* CVE-2020-10610 and CVE-2020-10608—Monitor HKLM\Software\PISystem and HKLM\WOW6432Node\Software\PISystem registry keys as well as ProgramData\PISystem folder for unauthorized changes.
* See OSIsoft customer portal knowledge article [Monitoring PISystem Registry](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=000027258).

For a list of PI System firewall port requirements, see knowledge base article [KB01162 - Firewall Port Requirements](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=KB01162).

**CVE-2020-10604, CVE-2020-10602, CVE-2020-10600**—Fully configure Windows authentication for the PI System and disable legacy authentication methods. For a starting point on PI System security best practices, see knowledge base article KB00833 - Seven best practices for securing your PI Server.

For more information and workaround details for these vulnerabilities, please refer to OSIsoft’s Security Bulletin (registration required): [OSIsoft Updates PI System and Common Components](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/knowledgearticle?knowledgeArticleUrl=000027554).

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
