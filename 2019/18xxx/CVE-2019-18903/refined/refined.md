{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When a network attacker sends a packet with invalid times inside a DHCP6 IA_PD option, the `ni_dhcp6_option_parse_ia_pd()` function frees the storage for the IA option but still stores it in the IA list.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free (UAF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A use-after-free vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially corrupt memory, leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted DHCPv6 packet with invalid times inside the IA_PD option.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A network attacker capable of sending DHCPv6 packets to a vulnerable system."
