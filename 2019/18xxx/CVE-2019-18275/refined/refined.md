Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-18275:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper Access Control

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the affected product. This allows unauthorized access to tag data when viewing analysis data reference attributes. Specifically, the system may return unauthorized tag data related to analysis data reference attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, specifically the unauthorized viewing of PI System data.

**Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) on the network or system to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is not required (UI:N).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of PI Vision prior to 2019.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 6.5 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, which translates to:
  - **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network)
  - **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
  - **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
  - **UI:N** (User Interaction: None)
  - **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged)
  - **C:H** (Confidentiality: High)
  - **I:N** (Integrity: None)
  - **A:N** (Availability: None)
- OSIsoft recommends upgrading to PI Vision 2019 to resolve the issue.
- If upgrading is not an option, administrators should regularly audit the AF hierarchy to ensure no unexpected or unknown elements/attributes.
- It is recommended that security on elements in AF be configured and enforced in addition to configuring PI point security.
- Potential unauthorized viewing of PI System data due to this issue is limited to permissions granted to the PI Vision Application Pool Identity. Configure a dedicated identity mapping for PI Vision servers and manage permissions in accordance with a data classification policy.
