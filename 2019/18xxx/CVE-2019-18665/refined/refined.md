Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-18665:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation when processing directory traversal sequences in the log module of SECUDOS DOMOS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files from the system
- Specifically mentioned is reading of session IDs, which could lead to session hijacking

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the web interface

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to the DOMOS web interface.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the DOMOS web interface (although one source claims unauthenticated access, it is contradicted by another source that specifies authenticated access)

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in DOMOS versions before 5.6.
- The vulnerability is located in the `sl_logdl` page when the `dcfct=DCMlog.download_log` parameter is used along with a crafted `dbkey:syslog.rlog` parameter, that allows path traversal to read files.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to obtain password hashes from `/etc/shadow`

The provided information gives good details about how to exploit the vulnerability.
