Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the SUSE-specific `mysql-systemd-helper` script. This script unsafely manipulates the `/var/lib/mysql/mysql_upgrade_info` file, which is in a directory owned by the `mysql` user. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the script uses `echo` and `chmod` commands to write to and modify this file with root privileges while the parent directory `/var/lib/mysql` is owned by the mysql user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink Attack:** The mysql user can create a symlink at the path `/var/lib/mysql/mysql_upgrade_info`. When the `mysql-systemd-helper` script, running as root, attempts to write to or modify this file, it could be redirected to a location outside of the intended `/var/lib/mysql` directory.
*   **Unsafe File Handling:** The script creates and modifies `mysql_upgrade_info` as root, which is located inside a directory owned by an unprivileged user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Permission Changes:** The attacker could manipulate files in the system, changing their permissions to 0640. While the file content cannot be fully controlled, this can lead to information disclosure or denial-of-service, and depending on the specific file, a privilege escalation might be possible.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By redirecting writes to critical system files or devices, an attacker could cause a DoS.
*   **Potential privilege escalation:** While not straightforward, the possibility exists that a carefully crafted symlink attack might be able to achieve a privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can only be exploited by a local user with access to the filesystem and the ability to create symlinks within `/var/lib/mysql`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** An attacker needs to have a user account on the affected system.
*   **Write Access:**  The attacker needs to have write permissions in `/var/lib/mysql` to create the symlink, which is usually granted to the user 'mysql'.
*   **No Special Permissions Required:** The attacker does not need to be root or have any elevated privileges to exploit the symlink vulnerability directly.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the SUSE-modified `mysql-systemd-helper` script.
*   The `chmod` command, while setting permissions to 0640, mitigates the ease of local root exploits as it does not allow world readable access to the file.
*   The provided SUSE bugzilla entry indicates that the issue was present in all maintained MariaDB code streams at the time of discovery.
*   SUSE has addressed this issue by either creating the file in a safe location owned by root, or by having the user who owns `/var/lib/mysql` create the file.
*   Multiple SUSE Security Advisories detail fixes for this vulnerability in various products and versions.
