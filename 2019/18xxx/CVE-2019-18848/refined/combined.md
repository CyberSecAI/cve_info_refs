# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : ruby-json-jwt
Version        : 1.6.2-1+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18848
Debian Bug     : 944850

The json-jwt gem before 1.11.0 for Ruby lacks an element
count during the splitting of a JWE string.

Therefore, there was a need to explicitly specify the number
of elements when splitting a JWE string.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.6.2-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-json-jwt packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-json-jwt please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-json-jwt>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

I'm trying to work out why this has a CVE classed as high severity.

From what I can see, previously you could end (or start) the jwt with a `'.'`, thereby setting `jwe.authentication_tag` to `nil`, or end with `'..'` to set both `jwe.cipher_text` and `jwe.authentication_tag` to `nil` etc. With this change, we now set the values to `""` instead of `nil`.

Processing the jwt would have always resulted in errors. The only issue I can see is that the errors would have been a mixture of `TypeError` and `NoMethodError` and maybe others rather than `DecryptionFailed`. Am I missing something?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Here is a demonstration of the bug:

```
require 'json/jwt'
require 'json/jwe'

describe JSON::JWE do
  let :aes_key do
    SecureRandom.random_bytes 16
  end

  let :hmac_key do
    SecureRandom.random_bytes 16
  end

  let :jwe_key do
    hmac_key + aes_key
  end

  let :valid_iv do
    SecureRandom.random_bytes 16
  end

  let :plaintext do
    'plaintext'
  end

  let :valid_encrypted_block do
    aes = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new('AES-128-CBC')
    aes.encrypt
    aes.key = aes_key
    aes.iv = valid_iv
    aes.update(plaintext) + aes.final
  end

  describe '.decrypt!' do
    it 'should fail if signature field is empty' do
      hdr = {'alg' => 'dir', 'enc' => 'A128CBC-HS256', 'kid' => '1'}
      iv = Base64.urlsafe_encode64(valid_iv)
      cipher_text = Base64.urlsafe_encode64(valid_encrypted_block)
      # generate compact JWE with empty signature field
      jwe_str_no_hmac = "#{Base64.urlsafe_encode64(JSON.generate(hdr))}..#{iv}.#{cipher_text}."
      # vulnerability here, does not raise exception
      expect {
        described_class.decode_compact_serialized(jwe_str_no_hmac, jwe_key)
      }.to raise_error(JSON::JWE::DecryptionFailed)
    end
  end
end

```

I understand now. `authentication_tag` was set to `nil` by `input.split`, but what I missed was that the getter contains a default `@authentication_tag ||= case...`. This made `verify_cbc_authentication_tag!` always succeed. Thank you for the reply.
