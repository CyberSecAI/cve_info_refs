Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-18664

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The DOMOS web interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `dbkey%3Asyslog.rlog` parameter of the `/page/sl_logdl` endpoint, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The web application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the response.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `dbkey%3Asyslog.rlog` parameter within the URL is directly reflected in the response without any proper validation or encoding.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack can be executed using a specially crafted GET request containing the malicious JavaScript payload.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The malicious payload is injected into the `dbkey%3Asyslog.rlog` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the DOMOS web interface.
*   **Web Interface Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to access the DOMOS web interface via a browser.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint and Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/page/sl_logdl`) and the susceptible parameter (`dbkey%3Asyslog.rlog`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session.
*   **Credential Theft:** The provided exploit description states that this vulnerability could be used to read password hashes from the file system, however, this does not seem accurate given the XSS vector and would likely require additional exploitation.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  The attacker could use the XSS to perform actions on behalf of the victim (e.g., change settings, steal cookies, redirect to malicious sites).

**CVSS v3 Base Score:** 3.5 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was present in DOMOS version 5.5 and fixed in version 5.6.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Pascal Keul, Patrick Muench and Torsten LÃ¶bner of SVA System Vertrieb Alexander GmbH.
*   The provided information has more detail than the official CVE description which is just a placeholder.
