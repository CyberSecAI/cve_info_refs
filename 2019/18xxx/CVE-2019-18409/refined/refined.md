Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2019-18409:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `ruby_parser-legacy` gem, specifically version 1.0.0, includes world-writable files within its release package.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is the presence of files with insecure file permissions (specifically, world-writable, indicated by `-perm -0002`). This allows any user on the system to modify these files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious code into these world-writable files. When another user requires and executes code from this gem, the injected malicious code will also be executed with the privileges of the user running that application, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the modification of world-writable files within the gem's installation directory. The files can be modified by any user with access to the system where the gem is installed.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable gem is installed and the ability to write to the affected files, which is granted by the insecure file permissions. The attacker also needs to have knowledge of the system configuration in order to know where the files are installed.
*  **Additional details:** The provided example exploits this by adding a shell command that outputs the `id` of the user running the application. The exploitation proof of concept demonstrates how requiring the gem in another project can lead to the execution of the malicious shell code during project startup.
