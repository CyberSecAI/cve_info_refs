RDMA/cxgb4: Do not dma memory off of the stack
commit 3840c5b78803b2b6cc1ff820100a74a092c40cbb upstream.
Nicolas pointed out that the cxgb4 driver is doing dma off of the stack,
which is generally considered a very bad thing. On some architectures it
could be a security problem, but odds are none of them actually run this
driver, so it's just a "normal" bug.
Resolve this by allocating the memory for a message off of the heap
instead of the stack. kmalloc() always will give us a proper memory
location that DMA will work correctly from.

blk-rq-qos: fix first node deletion of rq\_qos\_del()
commit 307f4065b9d7c1e887e8bdfb2487e4638559fea1 upstream.
rq\_qos\_del() incorrectly assigns the node being deleted to the head if
it was the first on the list in the !prev path. Fix it by iterating
with \*\* instead.

commit 5dba51754b04a941a1064f584e7a7f607df3f9bc upstream.
Commit d698a388146c ("of: reserved-memory: ignore disabled memory-region
nodes") added an early return in of\_reserved\_mem\_device\_init\_by\_idx(), but
didn't call of\_node\_put() on a device\_node whose ref-count was incremented
in the call to of\_parse\_phandle() preceding the early exit.

opp: of: drop incorrect lockdep\_assert\_held()
commit f2edbb6699b0bc6e4f789846b99007200546c6c2 upstream.
\_find\_opp\_of\_np() doesn't traverse the list of OPP tables but instead
just the entries within an OPP table and so only requires to lock the
OPP table itself.
The lockdep\_assert\_held() was added there by mistake and isn't really
required.

PCI: PM: Fix pci\_power\_up()
commit 45144d42f299455911cc29366656c7324a3a7c97 upstream.
There is an arbitrary difference between the system resume and
runtime resume code paths for PCI devices regarding the delay to
apply when switching the devices from D3cold to D0.
Namely, pci\_restore\_standard\_config() used in the runtime resume
code path calls pci\_set\_power\_state() which in turn invokes
\_\_pci\_start\_power\_transition() to power up the device through the
platform firmware and that function applies the transition delay
(as per PCI Express Base Specification Revision 2.0, Section 6.6.1).
However, pci\_pm\_default\_resume\_early() used in the system resume
code path calls pci\_power\_up() which doesn't apply the delay at
all and that causes issues to occur during resume from
suspend-to-idle on some systems where the delay is required.
Since there is no reason for that difference to exist, modify
pci\_power\_up() to follow pci\_set\_power\_state() more closely and
invoke \_\_pci\_start\_power\_transition() from there to call the
platform firmware to power up the device (in case that's necessary).

commit 1d3f87233e26362fc3d4e59f0f31a71b570f90b9 upstream.
In the future, we're going to want to extend the ceph\_reply\_info\_extra
for create replies. Currently though, the kernel code doesn't accept an
extra blob that is larger than the expected data.
Change the code to skip over any unrecognized fields at the end of the
extra blob, rather than returning -EIO.

cpufreq: Avoid cpufreq\_suspend() deadlock on system shutdown
commit 65650b35133ff20f0c9ef0abd5c3c66dbce3ae57 upstream.
It is incorrect to set the cpufreq syscore shutdown callback pointer
to cpufreq\_suspend(), because that function cannot be run in the
syscore stage of system shutdown for two reasons: (a) it may attempt
to carry out actions depending on devices that have already been shut
down at that point and (b) the RCU synchronization carried out by it
may not be able to make progress then.
The latter issue has been present since commit 45975c7d21a1 ("rcu:
Define RCU-sched API in terms of RCU for Tree RCU PREEMPT builds"),
but the former one has been there since commit 90de2a4aa9f3 ("cpufreq:
suspend cpufreq governors on shutdown") regardless.
Fix that by dropping cpufreq\_syscore\_ops altogether and making
device\_shutdown() call cpufreq\_suspend() directly before shutting
down devices, which is along the lines of what system-wide power
management does.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Ensure VP isn't already in use
commit 12ade69c1eb9958b13374edf5ef742ea20ccffde upstream.
Connecting a vCPU to a XIVE KVM device means establishing a 1:1
association between a vCPU id and the offset (VP id) of a VP
structure within a fixed size block of VPs. We currently try to
enforce the 1:1 relationship by checking that a vCPU with the
same id isn't already connected. This is good but unfortunately
not enough because we don't map VP ids to raw vCPU ids but to
packed vCPU ids, and the packing function kvmppc\_pack\_vcpu\_id()
isn't bijective by design. We got away with it because QEMU passes
vCPU ids that fit well in the packing pattern. But nothing prevents
userspace to come up with a forged vCPU id resulting in a packed id
collision which causes the KVM device to associate two vCPUs to the
same VP. This greatly confuses the irq layer and ultimately crashes
the kernel, as shown below.
Example: a guest with 1 guest thread per core, a core stride of
8 and 300 vCPUs has vCPU ids 0,8,16...2392. If QEMU is patched to
inject at some point an invalid vCPU id 348, which is the packed
version of itself and 2392, we get:

btrfs: tracepoints: Fix bad entry members of qgroup events
commit 1b2442b4ae0f234daeadd90e153b466332c466d8 upstream.
[BUG]
For btrfs:qgroup\_meta\_reserve event, the trace event can output garbage:
qgroup\_meta\_reserve: 9c7f6acc-b342-4037-bc47-7f6e4d2232d7: refroot=5(FS\_TREE) type=DATA diff=2
qgroup\_meta\_reserve: 9c7f6acc-b342-4037-bc47-7f6e4d2232d7: refroot=5(FS\_TREE) type=0x258792 diff=2
The @type can be completely garbage, as DATA type is not possible for
trace\_qgroup\_meta\_reserve() trace event.
[CAUSE]
Ther are several problems related to qgroup trace events:
- Unassigned entry member
Member entry::type of trace\_qgroup\_update\_reserve() and
trace\_qgourp\_meta\_reserve() is not assigned
- Redundant entry member
Member entry::type is completely useless in
trace\_qgroup\_meta\_convert()

Btrfs: check for the full sync flag while holding the inode lock during fsync
commit ba0b084ac309283db6e329785c1dc4f45fdbd379 upstream.
We were checking for the full fsync flag in the inode before locking the
inode, which is racy, since at that that time it might not be set but
after we acquire the inode lock some other task set it. One case where
this can happen is on a system low on memory and some concurrent task
failed to allocate an extent map and therefore set the full sync flag on
the inode, to force the next fsync to work in full mode.
A consequence of missing the full fsync flag set is hitting the problems
fixed by commit 0c713cbab620 ("Btrfs: fix race between ranged fsync and
writeback of adjacent ranges"), BUG\_ON() when dropping extents from a log
tree, hitting assertion failures at tree-log.c:copy\_items() or all sorts
of weird inconsistencies after replaying a log due to file extents items
representing ranges that overlap.
So just move the check such that it's done after locking the inode and
before starting writeback again.

Btrfs: fix qgroup double free after failure to reserve metadata for delalloc
commit c7967fc1499beb9b70bb9d33525fb0b384af8883 upstream.
If we fail to reserve metadata for delalloc operations we end up releasing
the previously reserved qgroup amount twice, once explicitly under the
'out\_qgroup' label by calling btrfs\_qgroup\_free\_meta\_prealloc() and once
again, under label 'out\_fail', by calling btrfs\_inode\_rsv\_release() with a
value of 'true' for its 'qgroup\_free' argument, which results in
btrfs\_qgroup\_free\_meta\_prealloc() being called again, so we end up having
a double free.
Also if we fail to reserve the necessary qgroup amount, we jump to the
label 'out\_fail', which calls btrfs\_inode\_rsv\_release() and that in turns
calls btrfs\_qgroup\_free\_meta\_prealloc(), even though we weren't able to
reserve any qgroup amount. So we freed some amount we never reserved.
So fix this by removing the call to btrfs\_inode\_rsv\_release() in the
failure path, since it's not necessary at all as we haven't changed the
inode's block reserve in any way at this point.

x86/hyperv: Make vapic support x2apic mode
commit e211288b72f15259da86eed6eca680758dbe9e74 upstream.
Now that there's Hyper-V IOMMU driver, Linux can switch to x2apic mode
when supported by the vcpus.
However, the apic access functions for Hyper-V enlightened apic assume
xapic mode only.
As a result, Linux fails to bring up secondary cpus when run as a guest
in QEMU/KVM with both hv\_apic and x2apic enabled.
According to Michael Kelley, when in x2apic mode, the Hyper-V synthetic
apic MSRs behave exactly the same as the corresponding architectural
x2apic MSRs, so there's no need to override the apic accessors. The
only exception is hv\_apic\_eoi\_write, which benefits from lazy EOI when
available; however, its implementation works for both xapic and x2apic
modes.

Check that the per-cpu cluster mask pointer has been set prior to
clearing a dying cpu's bit. The per-cpu pointer is not set until the
target cpu reaches smp\_callin() during CPUHP\_BRINGUP\_CPU, whereas the
teardown function, x2apic\_dead\_cpu(), is associated with the earlier

e.g. if do\_boot\_cpu() itself fails, x2apic\_dead\_cpu() will dereference
the NULL pointer and cause a panic.

x86/boot/64: Make level2\_kernel\_pgt pages invalid outside kernel area
commit 2aa85f246c181b1fa89f27e8e20c5636426be624 upstream.
Our hardware (UV aka Superdome Flex) has address ranges marked
reserved by the BIOS. Access to these ranges is caught as an error,
causing the BIOS to halt the system.
Initial page tables mapped a large range of physical addresses that
were not checked against the list of BIOS reserved addresses, and
sometimes included reserved addresses in part of the mapped range.
Including the reserved range in the map allowed processor speculative
accesses to the reserved range, triggering a BIOS halt.
Used early in booting, the page table level2\_kernel\_pgt addresses 1
GiB divided into 2 MiB pages, and it was set up to linearly map a full
1 GiB of physical addresses that included the physical address range
of the kernel image, as chosen by KASLR. But this also included a
large range of unused addresses on either side of the kernel image.
And unlike the kernel image's physical address range, this extra
mapped space was not checked against the BIOS tables of usable RAM
addresses. So there were times when the addresses chosen by KASLR
would result in processor accessible mappings of BIOS reserved
physical addresses.
The kernel code did not directly access any of this extra mapped
space, but having it mapped allowed the processor to issue speculative
accesses into reserved memory, causing system halts.
This was encountered somewhat rarely on a normal system boot, and much
more often when starting the crash kernel if "crashkernel=512M,high"
was specified on the command line (this heavily restricts the physical
address of the crash kernel, in our case usually within 1 GiB of
reserved space).
The solution is to invalidate the pages of this table outside the kernel
image's space before the page table is activated. It fixes this problem
on our hardware.

dm cache: fix bugs when a GFP\_NOWAIT allocation fails
commit 13bd677a472d534bf100bab2713efc3f9e3f5978 upstream.
GFP\_NOWAIT allocation can fail anytime - it doesn't wait for memory being
available and it fails if the mempool is exhausted and there is not enough
memory.
If we go down this path:
map\_bio -> mg\_start -> alloc\_migration -> mempool\_alloc(GFP\_NOWAIT)
we can see that map\_bio() doesn't check the return value of mg\_start(),
and the bio is leaked.
If we go down this path:
map\_bio -> mg\_start -> mg\_lock\_writes -> alloc\_prison\_cell ->
dm\_bio\_prison\_alloc\_cell\_v2 -> mempool\_alloc(GFP\_NOWAIT) ->
mg\_lock\_writes -> mg\_complete
the bio is ended with an error - it is unacceptable because it could
cause filesystem corruption if the machine ran out of memory
temporarily.
Change GFP\_NOWAIT to GFP\_NOIO, so that the mempool code will properly
wait until memory becomes available. mempool\_alloc with GFP\_NOIO can't
fail, so remove the code paths that deal with allocation failure.

total\_ref\_count++
free\_percpu(perf\_trace\_buf[i])
perf\_trace\_buf[i] = NULL
Any subsequent call to perf\_trace\_event\_reg() will observe total\_ref\_count > 0,
causing the perf\_trace\_buf to be always NULL. This can result in perf\_trace\_buf
getting accessed from perf\_trace\_buf\_alloc() without being initialized. Acquiring
event\_mutex in perf\_kprobe\_init() before calling perf\_trace\_event\_init() should
fix this race.

perf/aux: Fix AUX output stopping
commit f3a519e4add93b7b31a6616f0b09635ff2e6a159 upstream.
Commit:
8a58ddae2379 ("perf/core: Fix exclusive events' grouping")
allows CAP\_EXCLUSIVE events to be grouped with other events. Since all
of those also happen to be AUX events (which is not the case the other
way around, because arch/s390), this changes the rules for stopping the
output: the AUX event may not be on its PMU's context any more, if it's
grouped with a HW event, in which case it will be on that HW event's
context instead. If that's the case, munmap() of the AUX buffer can't
find and stop the AUX event, potentially leaving the last reference with
the atomic context, which will then end up freeing the AUX buffer. This
will then trip warnings:
Fix this by using the context's PMU context when looking for events
to stop, instead of the event's PMU context.

CIFS: Fix use after free of file info structures
commit 1a67c415965752879e2e9fad407bc44fc7f25f23 upstream.
Currently the code assumes that if a file info entry belongs
to lists of open file handles of an inode and a tcon then
it has non-zero reference. The recent changes broke that
assumption when putting the last reference of the file info.
There may be a situation when a file is being deleted but
nothing prevents another thread to reference it again
and start using it. This happens because we do not hold
the inode list lock while checking the number of references
of the file info structure. Fix this by doing the proper
locking when doing the check.

According to MS-CIFS specification MID 0xFFFF should not be used by the

leading to oops between SendReceive2/cifs\_demultiplex\_thread. On SMB1,
MID is a 2 byte value easy to reach in CurrentMid which may conflict with

commit d3ec3a08fa700c8b46abb137dce4e2514a6f9668 upstream.
In order to workaround the TX2-219 erratum, it is necessary to trap
TTBRx\_EL1 accesses to EL2. This is done by setting HCR\_EL2.TVM on
guest entry, which has the side effect of trapping all the other
VM-related sysregs as well.
To minimize the overhead, a fast path is used so that we don't
have to go all the way back to the main sysreg handling code,
unless the rest of the hypervisor expects to see these accesses.

EDAC/ghes: Fix Use after free in ghes\_edac remove path
commit 1e72e673b9d102ff2e8333e74b3308d012ddf75b upstream.
ghes\_edac models a single logical memory controller, and uses a global
ghes\_init variable to ensure only the first ghes\_edac\_register() will
do anything.
ghes\_edac is registered the first time a GHES entry in the HEST is
probed. There may be multiple entries, so subsequent attempts to
register ghes\_edac are silently ignored as the work has already been
done.
When a GHES entry is unregistered, it calls ghes\_edac\_unregister(),
which free()s the memory behind the global variables in ghes\_edac.
But there may be multiple GHES entries, the next call to
ghes\_edac\_unregister() will dereference the free()d memory, and attempt
to free it a second time.
This may also be triggered on a platform with one GHES entry, if the
driver is unbound/re-bound and unbound. The re-bind step will do
nothing because of ghes\_init, the second unbind will then do the same
work as the first.
Doing the unregister work on the first call is unsafe, as another
CPU may be processing a notification in ghes\_edac\_report\_mem\_error(),
using the memory we are about to free.
ghes\_init is already half of the reference counting. We only need
to do the register work for the first call, and the unregister work
for the last. Add the unregister check.
This means we no longer free ghes\_edac's memory while there are
GHES entries that may receive a notification.
This was detected by KASAN and DEBUG\_TEST\_DRIVER\_REMOVE.

POSIX requires an explicit NULL pointer check for clock\_getres() aside of

Add it back for both 32bit and 64bit.
Note, this is only a partial revert of the offending commit which does not
bring back the broken fallback invocation in the the 32bit compat

mm/memory-failure: poison read receives SIGKILL instead of SIGBUS if mmaped more than once
commit 3d7fed4ad8ccb691d217efbb0f934e6a4df5ef91 upstream.
Mmap /dev/dax more than once, then read the poison location using
address from one of the mappings. The other mappings due to not having
the page mapped in will cause SIGKILLs delivered to the process.
SIGKILL succeeds over SIGBUS, so user process loses the opportunity to
handle the UE.
Although one may add MAP\_POPULATE to mmap(2) to work around the issue,
MAP\_POPULATE makes mapping 128GB of pmem several magnitudes slower, so
isn't always an option.

hugetlbfs: don't access uninitialized memmaps in pfn\_range\_valid\_gigantic()
commit f231fe4235e22e18d847e05cbe705deaca56580a upstream.
Uninitialized memmaps contain garbage and in the worst case trigger
kernel BUGs, especially with CONFIG\_PAGE\_POISONING. They should not get
touched.
Let's make sure that we only consider online memory (managed by the
buddy) that has initialized memmaps. ZONE\_DEVICE is not applicable.
page\_zone() will call page\_to\_nid(), which will trigger
VM\_BUG\_ON\_PGFLAGS(PagePoisoned(page), page) with CONFIG\_PAGE\_POISONING
and CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM\_PGFLAGS when called on uninitialized memmaps. This
can be the case when an offline memory block (e.g., never onlined) is
spanned by a zone.
Note: As explained by Michal in [1], alloc\_contig\_range() will verify
the range. So it boils down to the wrong access in this function.

mm: memblock: do not enforce current limit for memblock\_phys\* family

Until commit 92d12f9544b7 ("memblock: refactor internal allocation
functions") the maximal address for memblock allocations was forced to
memblock.current\_limit only for the allocation functions returning
virtual address. The changes introduced by that commit moved the limit
enforcement into the allocation core and as a result the allocation
functions returning physical address also started to limit allocations
to memblock.current\_limit.
This caused breakage of etnaviv GPU driver:

mm: memcg: get number of pages on the LRU list in memcgroup base on lru\_zone\_size
commit b11edebbc967ebf5c55b8f9e1d5bb6d68ec3a7fd upstream.
Commit 1a61ab8038e72 ("mm: memcontrol: replace zone summing with
lruvec\_page\_state()") has made lruvec\_page\_state to use per-cpu counters
instead of calculating it directly from lru\_zone\_size with an idea that
this would be more effective.
Tim has reported that this is not really the case for their database
benchmark which is showing an opposite results where lruvec\_page\_state
is taking up a huge chunk of CPU cycles (about 25% of the system time
which is roughly 7% of total cpu cycles) on 5.3 kernels. The workload
is running on a larger machine (96cpus), it has many cgroups (500) and
it is heavily direct reclaim bound.
Tim Chen said:
: The problem can also be reproduced by running simple multi-threaded
: pmbench benchmark with a fast Optane SSD swap (see profile below).

The likely culprit is the cache traffic the lruvec\_page\_state\_local
generates. Dave Hansen says:
: I was thinking purely of the cache footprint. If it's reading
: pn->lruvec\_stat\_local->count[idx] is three separate cachelines, so 192
: bytes of cache \*96 CPUs = 18k of data, mostly read-only. 1 cgroup would
: be 18k of data for the whole system and the caching would be pretty
: efficient and all 18k would probably survive a tight page fault loop in
: the L1. 500 cgroups would be ~90k of data per CPU thread which doesn't
: fit in the L1 and probably wouldn't survive a tight page fault loop if
: both logical threads were banging on different cgroups.
:
: It's just a theory, but it's why I noted the number of cgroups when I
: initially saw this show up in profiles
Fix the regression by partially reverting the said commit and calculate
the lru size explicitly.

mm, compaction: fix wrong pfn handling in \_\_reset\_isolation\_pfn()
commit a2e9a5afce080226edbf1882d63d99bf32070e9e upstream.
Florian and Dave reported [1] a NULL pointer dereference in
\_\_reset\_isolation\_pfn(). While the exact cause is unclear, staring at
the code revealed two bugs, which might be related.
One bug is that if zone starts in the middle of pageblock, block\_page
might correspond to different pfn than block\_pfn, and then the
pfn\_valid\_within() checks will check different pfn's than those accessed
via struct page. This might result in acessing an unitialized page in
CONFIG\_HOLES\_IN\_ZONE configs.
The other bug is that end\_page refers to the first page of next
pageblock and not last page of current pageblock. The online and valid
check is then wrong and with sections, the while (page < end\_page) loop
might wander off actual struct page arrays.

Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
The kernel panics on an attempt to dereference the NULL memcg pointer.
When shutdown\_cache() is called from the kmem\_cache\_destroy() context, a
memcg kmem\_cache might have empty slab pages in a partial list, which are
still charged to the memory cgroup.
These pages are released by free\_partial() at the beginning of
shutdown\_cache(): either directly or by scheduling a RCU-delayed work
(if the kmem\_cache has the SLAB\_TYPESAFE\_BY\_RCU flag). The latter case
is when the reported panic can happen: memcg\_unlink\_cache() is called
immediately after shrinking partial lists, without waiting for scheduled
RCU works. It sets the kmem\_cache->memcg\_params.memcg pointer to NULL,
and the following attempt to dereference it by \_\_free\_slab() from the
RCU work context causes the panic.
To fix the issue, let's postpone the release of the memcg pointer to
destroy\_memcg\_params(). It's called from a separate work context by
slab\_caches\_to\_rcu\_destroy\_workfn(), which contains a full RCU barrier.
This guarantees that all scheduled page release RCU works will complete
before the memcg pointer will be zeroed.
Big thanks for Karsten for the perfect report containing all necessary
information, his help with the analysis of the problem and testing of the
fix.

mm/memunmap: don't access uninitialized memmap in memunmap\_pages()
commit 77e080e7680e1e615587352f70c87b9e98126d03 upstream.
Patch series "mm/memory\_hotplug: Shrink zones before removing memory",
v6.
This series fixes the access of uninitialized memmaps when shrinking
zones/nodes and when removing memory. Also, it contains all fixes for
crashes that can be triggered when removing certain namespace using
memunmap\_pages() - ZONE\_DEVICE, reported by Aneesh.
We stop trying to shrink ZONE\_DEVICE, as it's buggy, fixing it would be
more involved (we don't have SECTION\_IS\_ONLINE as an indicator), and
shrinking is only of limited use (set\_zone\_contiguous() cannot detect
the ZONE\_DEVICE as contiguous).
We continue shrinking !ZONE\_DEVICE zones, however, I reduced the amount
of code to a minimum. Shrinking is especially necessary to keep
zone->contiguous set where possible, especially, on memory unplug of
DIMMs at zone boundaries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zones are now properly shrunk when offlining memory blocks or when
onlining failed. This allows to properly shrink zones on memory unplug
even if the separate memory blocks of a DIMM were onlined to different
zones or re-onlined to a different zone after offlining.
Example:
:/# cat /proc/zoneinfo
Node 1, zone Movable
spanned 0
present 0
managed 0
:/# echo "online\_movable" > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory41/state
:/# echo "online\_movable" > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory43/state
:/# cat /proc/zoneinfo
Node 1, zone Movable
spanned 98304
present 65536
managed 65536
:/# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory43/online
:/# cat /proc/zoneinfo
Node 1, zone Movable
spanned 32768
present 32768
managed 32768
:/# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory41/online
:/# cat /proc/zoneinfo
Node 1, zone Movable
spanned 0
present 0
managed 0
This patch (of 10):
With an altmap, the memmap falling into the reserved altmap space are not
initialized and, therefore, contain a garbage NID and a garbage zone.
Make sure to read the NID/zone from a memmap that was initialized.
This fixes a kernel crash that is observed when destroying a namespace:

mm/page\_owner: don't access uninitialized memmaps when reading /proc/pagetypeinfo
commit a26ee565b6cd8dc2bf15ff6aa70bbb28f928b773 upstream.
Uninitialized memmaps contain garbage and in the worst case trigger
kernel BUGs, especially with CONFIG\_PAGE\_POISONING. They should not get
touched.
For example, when not onlining a memory block that is spanned by a zone
and reading /proc/pagetypeinfo with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM\_PGFLAGS and
CONFIG\_PAGE\_POISONING, we can trigger a kernel BUG:
:/# echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory40/online
:/# echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory42/online
:/# cat /proc/pagetypeinfo > test.file
page:fffff2c585200000 is uninitialized and poisoned
raw: ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff
raw: ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff ffffffffffffffff
page dumped because: VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(PagePoisoned(p))
There is not page extension available.
------------[ cut here ]------------
kernel BUG at include/linux/mm.h:1107!
invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI
Please note that this change does not affect ZONE\_DEVICE, because
pagetypeinfo\_showmixedcount\_print() is called from
mm/vmstat.c:pagetypeinfo\_showmixedcount() only for populated zones, and
ZONE\_DEVICE is never populated (zone->present\_pages always 0).

mm/slub: fix a deadlock in show\_slab\_objects()
commit e4f8e513c3d353c134ad4eef9fd0bba12406c7c8 upstream.
A long time ago we fixed a similar deadlock in show\_slab\_objects() [1].
However, it is apparently due to the commits like 01fb58bcba63 ("slab:
remove synchronous synchronize\_sched() from memcg cache deactivation
path") and 03afc0e25f7f ("slab: get\_online\_mems for
kmem\_cache\_{create,destroy,shrink}"), this kind of deadlock is back by
just reading files in /sys/kernel/slab which will generate a lockdep
splat below.
Since the "mem\_hotplug\_lock" here is only to obtain a stable online node
mask while racing with NUMA node hotplug, in the worst case, the results
may me miscalculated while doing NUMA node hotplug, but they shall be
corrected by later reads of the same files.

I think it is important to mention that this doesn't expose the

might really race here and that is the slab hotplug notifier callback
\_\_kmem\_cache\_shrink (via slab\_mem\_going\_offline\_callback) but that path
doesn't really destroy kmem\_cache\_node data structures.

mmc: sdhci-omap: Fix Tuning procedure for temperatures < -20C
commit feb40824d78eac5e48f56498dca941754dff33d7 upstream.
According to the App note[1] detailing the tuning algorithm, for
temperatures < -20C, the initial tuning value should be min(largest value
in LPW - 24, ceil(13/16 ratio of LPW)). The largest value in LPW is
(max\_window + 4 \* (max\_len - 1)) and not (max\_window + 4 \* max\_len) itself.
Fix this implementation.

io\_uring: used cached copies of sq->dropped and cq->overflow

We currently use the ring values directly, but that can lead to issues
if the application is malicious and changes these values on our behalf.
Created in-kernel cached versions of them, and just overwrite the user
side when we update them. This is similar to how we treat the sq/cq
ring tail/head updates.

fs/proc/page.c: don't access uninitialized memmaps in fs/proc/page.c
commit aad5f69bc161af489dbb5934868bd347282f0764 upstream.
There are three places where we access uninitialized memmaps, namely:
- /proc/kpagecount
- /proc/kpageflags
- /proc/kpagecgroup
We have initialized memmaps either when the section is online or when the
page was initialized to the ZONE\_DEVICE. Uninitialized memmaps contain
garbage and in the worst case trigger kernel BUGs, especially with
CONFIG\_PAGE\_POISONING.
For example, not onlining a DIMM during boot and calling /proc/kpagecount
with CONFIG\_PAGE\_POISONING:
:/# cat /proc/kpagecount > tmp.test
BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: fffffffffffffffe

For now, let's drop support for ZONE\_DEVICE from the three pseudo files
in order to fix this. To distinguish offline memory (with garbage
memmap) from ZONE\_DEVICE memory with properly initialized memmaps, we
would have to check get\_dev\_pagemap() and pfn\_zone\_device\_reserved()
right now. The usage of both (especially, special casing devmem) is
frowned upon and needs to be reworked.
The fundamental issue we have is:
if (pfn\_to\_online\_page(pfn)) {
/\* memmap initialized \*/
} else if (pfn\_valid(pfn)) {
/\*
\* ???
\* a) offline memory. memmap garbage.
\* b) devmem: memmap initialized to ZONE\_DEVICE.
\* c) devmem: reserved for driver. memmap garbage.
\* (d) devmem: memmap currently initializing - garbage)
\*/
}
We'll leave the pfn\_zone\_device\_reserved() check in stable\_page\_flags()
in place as that function is also used from memory failure. We now no
longer dump information about pages that are not in use anymore -
offline.

drivers/base/memory.c: don't access uninitialized memmaps in soft\_offline\_page\_store()
commit 641fe2e9387a36f9ee01d7c69382d1fe147a5e98 upstream.
Uninitialized memmaps contain garbage and in the worst case trigger kernel
BUGs, especially with CONFIG\_PAGE\_POISONING. They should not get touched.
Right now, when trying to soft-offline a PFN that resides on a memory
block that was never onlined, one gets a misleading error with
CONFIG\_PAGE\_POISONING:
:/# echo 5637144576 > /sys/devices/system/memory/soft\_offline\_page
[ 23.097167] soft offline: 0x150000 page already poisoned
But the actual result depends on the garbage in the memmap.
soft\_offline\_page() can only work with online pages, it returns -EIO in
case of ZONE\_DEVICE. Make sure to only forward pages that are online
(iow, managed by the buddy) and, therefore, have an initialized memmap.
Add a check against pfn\_to\_online\_page() and similarly return -EIO.

drm/i915/userptr: Never allow userptr into the mappable GGTT
commit 4f2a572eda67aecb1e7e4fc26cc985fb8158f6e8 upstream.
Daniel Vetter uncovered a nasty cycle in using the mmu-notifiers to
invalidate userptr objects which also happen to be pulled into GGTT
mmaps. That is when we unbind the userptr object (on mmu invalidation),
we revoke all CPU mmaps, which may then recurse into mmu invalidation.
We looked for ways of breaking the cycle, but the revocation on
invalidation is required and cannot be avoided. The only solution we
could see was to not allow such GGTT bindings of userptr objects in the
first place. In practice, no one really wants to use a GGTT mmapping of
a CPU pointer...
Just before Daniel's explosive lockdep patches land in v5.4-rc1, we got
a genuine blip from CI:

drm/amdgpu: Bail earlier when amdgpu.cik\_/si\_support is not set to 1
commit 984d7a929ad68b7be9990fc9c5cfa5d5c9fc7942 upstream.
Bail from the pci\_driver probe function instead of from the drm\_driver
load function.
This avoid /dev/dri/card0 temporarily getting registered and then
unregistered again, sending unwanted add / remove udev events to
userspace.
Specifically this avoids triggering the (userspace) bug fixed by this
plymouth merge-request:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/plymouth/plymouth/merge\_requests/59
Note that despite that being a userspace bug, not sending unnecessary
udev events is a good idea in general.

drm/panfrost: Handle resetting on timeout better
commit 5b3ec8134f5f9fa1ed0a538441a495521078bbee upstream.
Panfrost uses multiple schedulers (one for each slot, so 2 in reality),
and on a timeout has to stop all the schedulers to safely perform a
reset. However more than one scheduler can trigger a timeout at the same
time. This race condition results in jobs being freed while they are
still in use.
When stopping other slots use cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync() to ensure that
any timeout started for that slot has completed. Also use
mutex\_trylock() to obtain reset\_lock. This means that only one thread
attempts the reset, the other threads will simply complete without doing
anything (the first thread will wait for this in the call to
cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync()).
While we're here and since the function is already dependent on
sched\_job not being NULL, let's remove the unnecessary checks.

drm/ttm: Restore ttm prefaulting
commit 941f2f72dbbe0cf8c2d6e0b180a8021a0ec477fa upstream.
Commit 4daa4fba3a38 ("gpu: drm: ttm: Adding new return type vm\_fault\_t")
broke TTM prefaulting. Since vmf\_insert\_mixed() typically always returns
VM\_FAULT\_NOPAGE, prefaulting stops after the second PTE.
Restore (almost) the original behaviour. Unfortunately we can no longer
with the new vm\_fault\_t return type determine whether a prefaulting
PTE insertion hit an already populated PTE, and terminate the insertion
loop. Instead we continue with the pre-determined number of prefaults.

accordingly. Additionally, remove 0x1010 and 0x1210 subsytem IDs from

ASoC: rsnd: Reinitialize bit clock inversion flag for every format setting
commit 22e58665a01006d05f0239621f7d41cacca96cc4 upstream.
Unlike other format-related DAI parameters, rdai->bit\_clk\_inv flag
is not properly re-initialized when setting format for new stream
processing. The inversion, if requested, is then applied not to default,
but to a previous value, which leads to SCKP bit in SSICR register being
set incorrectly.
Fix this by re-setting the flag to its initial value, determined by format.

Input: synaptics-rmi4 - avoid processing unknown IRQs
commit 363c53875aef8fce69d4a2d0873919ccc7d9e2ad upstream.
rmi\_process\_interrupt\_requests() calls handle\_nested\_irq() for
each interrupt status bit it finds. If the irq domain mapping for
this bit had not yet been set up, then it ends up calling
handle\_nested\_irq(0), which causes a NULL pointer dereference.
There's already code that masks the irq\_status bits coming out of the
hardware with current\_irq\_mask, presumably to avoid this situation.
However current\_irq\_mask seems to more reflect the actual mask set
in the hardware rather than the IRQs software has set up and registered
for. For example, in rmi\_driver\_reset\_handler(), the current\_irq\_mask
is initialized based on what is read from the hardware. If the reset
value of this mask enables IRQs that Linux has not set up yet, then
we end up in this situation.
There appears to be a third unused bitmask that used to serve this
purpose, fn\_irq\_bits. Use that bitmask instead of current\_irq\_mask
to avoid calling handle\_nested\_irq() on IRQs that have not yet been
set up.

scsi: core: save/restore command resid for error handling
commit 8f8fed0cdbbd6cdbf28d9ebe662f45765d2f7d39 upstream.
When a non-passthrough command is terminated with CHECK CONDITION, request
sense is executed by hijacking the command descriptor. Since
scsi\_eh\_prep\_cmnd() and scsi\_eh\_restore\_cmnd() do not save/restore the
original command resid, the value returned on failure of the original
command is lost and replaced with the value set by the execution of the
request sense command. This value may in many instances be unaligned to the
device sector size, causing sd\_done() to print a warning message about the
incorrect unaligned resid before the command is retried.
Fix this problem by saving the original command residual in struct
scsi\_eh\_save using scsi\_eh\_prep\_cmnd() and restoring it in
scsi\_eh\_restore\_cmnd(). In addition, to make sure that the request sense
command is executed with a correctly initialized command structure, also
reset the residual to 0 in scsi\_eh\_prep\_cmnd() after saving the original
command value in struct scsi\_eh\_save.

scsi: zfcp: fix reaction on bit error threshold notification
commit 2190168aaea42c31bff7b9a967e7b045f07df095 upstream.
On excessive bit errors for the FCP channel ingress fibre path, the channel
notifies us. Previously, we only emitted a kernel message and a trace
record. Since performance can become suboptimal with I/O timeouts due to
bit errors, we now stop using an FCP device by default on channel
notification so multipath on top can timely failover to other paths. A new
module parameter zfcp.ber\_stop can be used to get zfcp old behavior.
User explanation of new kernel message:
\* Description:
\* The FCP channel reported that its bit error threshold has been exceeded.
\* These errors might result from a problem with the physical components
\* of the local fibre link into the FCP channel.
\* The problem might be damage or malfunction of the cable or
\* cable connection between the FCP channel and
\* the adjacent fabric switch port or the point-to-point peer.
\* Find details about the errors in the HBA trace for the FCP device.
\* The zfcp device driver closed down the FCP device
\* to limit the performance impact from possible I/O command timeouts.
\* User action:
\* Check for problems on the local fibre link, ensure that fibre optics are
\* clean and functional, and all cables are properly plugged.
\* After the repair action, you can manually recover the FCP device by
\* writing "0" into its "failed" sysfs attribute.
\* If recovery through sysfs is not possible, set the CHPID of the device
\* offline and back online on the service element.

MIPS: tlbex: Fix build\_restore\_pagemask KScratch restore
commit b42aa3fd5957e4daf4b69129e5ce752a2a53e7d6 upstream.
build\_restore\_pagemask() will restore the value of register $1/$at when
its restore\_scratch argument is non-zero, and aims to do so by filling a
branch delay slot. Commit 0b24cae4d535 ("MIPS: Add missing EHB in mtc0
-> mfc0 sequence.") added an EHB instruction (Execution Hazard Barrier)
prior to restoring $1 from a KScratch register, in order to resolve a
hazard that can result in stale values of the KScratch register being
observed. In particular, P-class CPUs from MIPS with out of order
execution pipelines such as the P5600 & P6600 are affected.
Unfortunately this EHB instruction was inserted in the branch delay slot
causing the MFC0 instruction which performs the restoration to no longer
execute along with the branch. The result is that the $1 register isn't
actually restored, ie. the TLB refill exception handler clobbers it -
which is exactly the problem the EHB is meant to avoid for the P-class
CPUs.
Similarly build\_get\_pgd\_vmalloc() will restore the value of $1/$at when
its mode argument equals refill\_scratch, and suffers from the same
problem.
Fix this by in both cases moving the EHB earlier in the emitted code.
There's no reason it needs to immediately precede the MFC0 - it simply
needs to be between the MTC0 & MFC0.
This bug only affects Cavium Octeon systems which use
build\_fast\_tlb\_refill\_handler().

binder: Don't modify VMA bounds in ->mmap handler
commit 45d02f79b539073b76077836871de6b674e36eb4 upstream.
binder\_mmap() tries to prevent the creation of overly big binder mappings
by silently truncating the size of the VMA to 4MiB. However, this violates
the API contract of mmap(). If userspace attempts to create a large binder
VMA, and later attempts to unmap that VMA, it will call munmap() on a range
beyond the end of the VMA, which may have been allocated to another VMA in
the meantime. This can lead to userspace memory corruption.
The following sequence of calls leads to a segfault without this commit:
int main(void) {
int binder\_fd = open("/dev/binder", O\_RDWR);
if (binder\_fd == -1) err(1, "open binder");
void \*binder\_mapping = mmap(NULL, 0x800000UL, PROT\_READ, MAP\_SHARED,
binder\_fd, 0);
if (binder\_mapping == MAP\_FAILED) err(1, "mmap binder");
void \*data\_mapping = mmap(NULL, 0x400000UL, PROT\_READ|PROT\_WRITE,
MAP\_PRIVATE|MAP\_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
if (data\_mapping == MAP\_FAILED) err(1, "mmap data");

USB: ldusb: fix read info leaks
commit 7a6f22d7479b7a0b68eadd308a997dd64dda7dae upstream.
Fix broken read implementation, which could be used to trigger slab info
leaks.
The driver failed to check if the custom ring buffer was still empty
when waking up after having waited for more data. This would happen on
every interrupt-in completion, even if no data had been added to the
ring buffer (e.g. on disconnect events).
Due to missing sanity checks and uninitialised (kmalloced) ring-buffer
entries, this meant that huge slab info leaks could easily be triggered.
Note that the empty-buffer check after wakeup is enough to fix the info
leak on disconnect, but let's clear the buffer on allocation and add a
sanity check to read() to prevent further leaks.

usb: udc: lpc32xx: fix bad bit shift operation
commit b987b66ac3a2bc2f7b03a0ba48a07dc553100c07 upstream.
It seems that the right variable to use in this case is \*i\*, instead of
\*n\*, otherwise there is an undefined behavior when right shifiting by more
than 31 bits when multiplying n by 8; notice that \*n\* can take values
equal or greater than 4 (4, 8, 16, ...).
Also, notice that under the current conditions (bl = 3), we are skiping
the handling of bytes 3, 7, 31... So, fix this by updating this logic
and limit \*bl\* up to 4 instead of up to 3.
This fix is based on function udc\_stuff\_fifo().

ALSA: hda - Force runtime PM on Nvidia HDMI codecs
commit 94989e318b2f11e217e86bee058088064fa9a2e9 upstream.
Przemysław Kopa reports that since commit b516ea586d71 ("PCI: Enable
NVIDIA HDA controllers"), the discrete GPU Nvidia GeForce GT 540M on his
2011 Samsung laptop refuses to runtime suspend, resulting in a power
regression and excessive heat.
Rivera Valdez witnesses the same issue with a GeForce GT 525M (GF108M)
of the same era, as does another Arch Linux user named "R0AR" with a
more recent GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (GP107M).
The commit exposes the discrete GPU's HDA controller and all four codecs
on the controller do not set the CLKSTOP and EPSS bits in the Supported
Power States Response. They also do not set the PS-ClkStopOk bit in the
Get Power State Response. hda\_codec\_runtime\_suspend() therefore does
not call snd\_hdac\_codec\_link\_down(), which prevents each codec and the
PCI device from runtime suspending.
The same issue is present on some AMD discrete GPUs and we addressed it
by forcing runtime PM despite the bits not being set, see commit
57cb54e53bdd ("ALSA: hda - Force to link down at runtime suspend on
ATI/AMD HDMI").
Do the same for Nvidia HDMI codecs.

On Asus MJ401TA (with Realtek ALC256), the headset mic is connected to
pin 0x19, with default configuration value 0x411111f0 (indicating no

Enable this by quirking the pin. Mic jack detection was also tested and

There is a bug, where failed linked requests are returned not with

The reason is that io\_fail\_links() uses req->user\_data, which is
uninitialised when called from io\_queue\_sqe() on fail path.

io\_uring: fix bad inflight accounting for SETUP\_IOPOLL|SETUP\_SQTHREAD
commit 2b2ed9750fc9d040b9f6d076afcef6f00b6f1f7c upstream.
We currently assume that submissions from the sqthread are successful,
and if IO polling is enabled, we use that value for knowing how many
completions to look for. But if we overflowed the CQ ring or some
requests simply got errored and already completed, they won't be
available for polling.
For the case of IO polling and SQTHREAD usage, look at the pending
poll list. If it ever hits empty then we know that we don't have
anymore pollable requests inflight. For that case, simply reset
the inflight count to zero.

net: phy: Fix "link partner" information disappear issue
[ Upstream commit 3de5ae54712c75cf3c517a288e0a704784ec6cf5 ]
Some drivers just call phy\_ethtool\_ksettings\_set() to set the
links, for those phy drivers that use genphy\_read\_status(), if
autoneg is on, and the link is up, than execute "ethtool -s
ethx autoneg on" will cause "link partner" information disappear.
The call trace is phy\_ethtool\_ksettings\_set()->phy\_start\_aneg()
->linkmode\_zero(phydev->lp\_advertising)->genphy\_read\_status(),
the link didn't change, so genphy\_read\_status() just return, and
phydev->lp\_advertising is zero now.
This patch moves the clear operation of lp\_advertising from
phy\_start\_aneg() to genphy\_read\_lpa()/genphy\_c45\_read\_lpa(), and
if autoneg on and autoneg not complete, just clear what the
generic functions care about.

net/sched: fix corrupted L2 header with MPLS 'push' and 'pop' actions
[ Upstream commit fa4e0f8855fcba600e0be2575ee29c69166f74bd ]
the following script:
# tc qdisc add dev eth0 clsact
# tc filter add dev eth0 egress protocol ip matchall \
> action mpls push protocol mpls\_uc label 0x355aa bos 1
causes corruption of all IP packets transmitted by eth0. On TC egress, we
can't rely on the value of skb->mac\_len, because it's 0 and a MPLS 'push'
operation will result in an overwrite of the first 4 octets in the packet
L2 header (e.g. the Destination Address if eth0 is an Ethernet); the same
error pattern is present also in the MPLS 'pop' operation. Fix this error
in act\_mpls data plane, computing 'mac\_len' as the difference between the
network header and the mac header (when not at TC ingress), and use it in
MPLS 'push'/'pop' core functions.
v2: unbreak 'make htmldocs' because of missing documentation of 'mac\_len'
in skb\_mpls\_pop(), reported by kbuild test robot

net: avoid errors when trying to pop MLPS header on non-MPLS packets
[ Upstream commit dedc5a08da07874c6e0d411e7f39c5c2cf137014 ]
the following script:
# tc qdisc add dev eth0 clsact
# tc filter add dev eth0 egress matchall action mpls pop
implicitly makes the kernel drop all packets transmitted by eth0, if they
don't have a MPLS header. This behavior is uncommon: other encapsulations
(like VLAN) just let the packet pass unmodified. Since the result of MPLS
'pop' operation would be the same regardless of the presence / absence of
MPLS header(s) in the original packet, we can let skb\_mpls\_pop() return 0
when dealing with non-MPLS packets.
For the OVS use-case, this is acceptable because \_\_ovs\_nla\_copy\_actions()
already ensures that MPLS 'pop' operation only occurs with packets having
an MPLS Ethernet type (and there are no other callers in current code, so
the semantic change should be ok).

[ Upstream commit 8b95599c55ed24b36cf44a4720067cfe67edbcb4 ]
The KSZ8051 PHY and the KSZ8794/KSZ8795/KSZ8765 switch share exactly the
same PHY ID. Since KSZ8051 is higher in the ksphy\_driver[] list of PHYs
in the micrel PHY driver, it is used even with the KSZ87xx switch. This
is wrong, since the KSZ8051 configures registers of the PHY which are
not present on the simplified KSZ87xx switch PHYs and misconfigures
other registers of the KSZ87xx switch PHYs.
Fortunatelly, it is possible to tell apart the KSZ8051 PHY from the
KSZ87xx switch by checking the Basic Status register Bit 0, which is
read-only and indicates presence of the Extended Capability Registers.
The KSZ8051 PHY has those registers while the KSZ87xx switch does not.
This patch implements simple check for the presence of this bit for
both the KSZ8051 PHY and KSZ87xx switch, to let both use the correct
PHY driver instance.

We now do separate logic and consider both ALLMULTI and MULTICAST
flags on the device.

net: aquantia: do not pass lro session with invalid tcp checksum
[ Upstream commit d08b9a0a3ebdf71b0aabe576c7dd48e57e80e0f0 ]
Individual descriptors on LRO TCP session should be checked
for CRC errors. It was discovered that HW recalculates
L4 checksums on LRO session and does not break it up on bad L4
csum.
Thus, driver should aggregate HW LRO L4 statuses from all individual
buffers of LRO session and drop packet if one of the buffers has bad
L4 checksum.

It was caused by when sending msgs without binding a port, in the path:
inet\_sendmsg() -> inet\_send\_prepare() -> inet\_autobind() ->
.get\_port/sctp\_get\_port(), sp->bind\_hash will be set while bp->port is
not. Later when binding another port by sctp\_setsockopt\_bindx(), a new
bucket will be created as bp->port is not set.
sctp's autobind is supposed to call sctp\_autobind() where it does all
things including setting bp->port. Since sctp\_autobind() is called in
sctp\_sendmsg() if the sk is not yet bound, it should have skipped the
auto bind.
THis patch is to avoid calling inet\_autobind() in inet\_send\_prepare()
by changing sctp\_prot .no\_autobind with true, also remove the unused
.get\_port.

sched: etf: Fix ordering of packets with same txtime
[ Upstream commit 28aa7c86c2b49f659c8460a89e53b506c45979bb ]
When a application sends many packets with the same txtime, they may
be transmitted out of order (different from the order in which they
were enqueued).
This happens because when inserting elements into the tree, when the
txtime of two packets are the same, the new packet is inserted at the
left side of the tree, causing the reordering. The only effect of this
change should be that packets with the same txtime will be transmitted
in the order they are enqueued.
The application in question (the AVTP GStreamer plugin, still in
development) is sending video traffic, in which each video frame have
a single presentation time, the problem is that when packetizing,
multiple packets end up with the same txtime.
The receiving side was rejecting packets because they were being
received out of order.

rxrpc: Fix possible NULL pointer access in ICMP handling
[ Upstream commit f0308fb0708078d6c1d8a4d533941a7a191af634 ]
If an ICMP packet comes in on the UDP socket backing an AF\_RXRPC socket as
the UDP socket is being shut down, rxrpc\_error\_report() may get called to
deal with it after sk\_user\_data on the UDP socket has been cleared, leading
to a NULL pointer access when this local endpoint record gets accessed.
Fix this by just returning immediately if sk\_user\_data was NULL.
The oops looks like the following:

pSeries machines on POWER9 processors can run with the XICS (legacy)
interrupt mode or with the XIVE exploitation interrupt mode. These
interrupt contollers have different interfaces for interrupt
management : XICS uses hcalls and XIVE loads and stores on a page.
H\_EOI being a XICS interface the enable\_scrq\_irq() routine can fail
when the machine runs in XIVE mode.
Fix that by calling the EOI handler of the interrupt chip.

net: avoid potential infinite loop in tc\_ctl\_action()
[ Upstream commit 39f13ea2f61b439ebe0060393e9c39925c9ee28c ]
tc\_ctl\_action() has the ability to loop forever if tcf\_action\_add()
returns -EAGAIN.
This special case has been done in case a module needed to be loaded,
but it turns out that tcf\_add\_notify() could also return -EAGAIN
if the socket sk\_rcvbuf limit is hit.
We need to separate the two cases, and only loop for the module
loading case.
While we are at it, add a limit of 10 attempts since unbounded
loops are always scary.
syzbot repro was something like :
socket(PF\_NETLINK, SOCK\_RAW|SOCK\_NONBLOCK, NETLINK\_ROUTE) = 3

ipv4: Return -ENETUNREACH if we can't create route but saddr is valid
[ Upstream commit 595e0651d0296bad2491a4a29a7a43eae6328b02 ]
...instead of -EINVAL. An issue was found with older kernel versions
while unplugging a NFS client with pending RPCs, and the wrong error
code here prevented it from recovering once link is back up with a
configured address.
Incidentally, this is not an issue anymore since commit 4f8943f80883
("SUNRPC: Replace direct task wakeups from softirq context"), included
in 5.2-rc7, had the effect of decoupling the forwarding of this error
by using SO\_ERROR in xs\_wake\_error(), as pointed out by Benjamin
Coddington.
To the best of my knowledge, this isn't currently causing any further
issue, but the error code doesn't look appropriate anyway, and we
might hit this in other paths as well.
In detail, as analysed by Gonzalo Siero, once the route is deleted
because the interface is down, and can't be resolved and we return
-EINVAL here, this ends up, courtesy of inet\_sk\_rebuild\_header(),
as the socket error seen by tcp\_write\_err(), called by
tcp\_retransmit\_timer().
In turn, tcp\_write\_err() indirectly calls xs\_error\_report(), which
wakes up the RPC pending tasks with a status of -EINVAL. This is then
seen by call\_status() in the SUN RPC implementation, which aborts the
RPC call calling rpc\_exit(), instead of handling this as a
potentially temporary condition, i.e. as a timeout.
Return -EINVAL only if the input parameters passed to
ip\_route\_output\_key\_hash\_rcu() are actually invalid (this is the case
if the specified source address is multicast, limited broadcast or
all zeroes), but return -ENETUNREACH in all cases where, at the given
moment, the given source address doesn't allow resolving the route.
While at it, drop the initialisation of err to -ENETUNREACH, which
was added to \_\_ip\_route\_output\_key() back then by commit
0315e3827048 ("net: Fix behaviour of unreachable, blackhole and
prohibit routes"), but actually had no effect, as it was, and is,
overwritten by the fib\_lookup() return code assignment, and anyway
ignored in all other branches, including the if (fl4->saddr) one:
I find this rather confusing, as it would look like -ENETUNREACH is
the "default" error, while that statement has no effect.
Also note that after commit fc75fc8339e7 ("ipv4: dont create routes
on down devices"), we would get -ENETUNREACH if the device is down,
but -EINVAL if the source address is specified and we can't resolve
the route, and this appears to be rather inconsistent.

ipv4: fix race condition between route lookup and invalidation
[ Upstream commit 5018c59607a511cdee743b629c76206d9c9e6d7b ]
Jesse and Ido reported the following race condition:
 - Received packet A is forwarded and cached dst entry is
taken from the nexthop ('nhc->nhc\_rth\_input'). Calls skb\_dst\_set()
 - Given Jesse has busy routers ("ingesting full BGP routing tables
from multiple ISPs"), route is added / deleted and rt\_cache\_flush() is
called
 - Received packet B tries to use the same cached dst entry
from t0, but rt\_cache\_valid() is no longer true and it is replaced in
rt\_cache\_route() by the newer one. This calls dst\_dev\_put() on the
original dst entry which assigns the blackhole netdev to 'dst->dev'
 - dst\_input(skb) is called on packet A and it is dropped due
to 'dst->dev' being the blackhole netdev
There are 2 issues in the v4 routing code:
1. A per-netns counter is used to do the validation of the route. That
means whenever a route is changed in the netns, users of all routes in
the netns needs to redo lookup. v6 has an implementation of only
updating fn\_sernum for routes that are affected.
2. When rt\_cache\_valid() returns false, rt\_cache\_route() is called to
throw away the current cache, and create a new one. This seems
unnecessary because as long as this route does not change, the route
cache does not need to be recreated.
To fully solve the above 2 issues, it probably needs quite some code
changes and requires careful testing, and does not suite for net branch.
So this patch only tries to add the deleted cached rt into the uncached
list, so user could still be able to use it to receive packets until
it's done.

uaccess: implement a proper unsafe\_copy\_to\_user() and switch filldir over to it
[ Upstream commit c512c69187197fe08026cb5bbe7b9709f4f89b73 ]
In commit 9f79b78ef744 ("Convert filldir[64]() from \_\_put\_user() to
unsafe\_put\_user()") I made filldir() use unsafe\_put\_user(), which
improves code generation on x86 enormously.
But because we didn't have a "unsafe\_copy\_to\_user()", the dirent name
copy was also done by hand with unsafe\_put\_user() in a loop, and it
turns out that a lot of other architectures didn't like that, because
unlike x86, they have various alignment issues.
Most non-x86 architectures trap and fix it up, and some (like xtensa)
will just fail unaligned put\_user() accesses unconditionally. Which
makes that "copy using put\_user() in a loop" not work for them at all.
I could make that code do explicit alignment etc, but the architectures
that don't like unaligned accesses also don't really use the fancy
"user\_access\_begin/end()" model, so they might just use the regular old
\_\_copy\_to\_user() interface.
So this commit takes that looping implementation, turns it into the x86
version of "unsafe\_copy\_to\_user()", and makes other architectures
implement the unsafe copy version as \_\_copy\_to\_user() (the same way they
do for the other unsafe\_xyz() accessor functions).
Note that it only does this for the copying \_to\_ user space, and we
still don't have a unsafe version of copy\_from\_user().
That's partly because we have no current users of it, but also partly
because the copy\_from\_user() case is slightly different and cannot
efficiently be implemented in terms of a unsafe\_get\_user() loop (because
gcc can't do asm goto with outputs).
It would be trivial to do this using "rep movsb", which would work
really nicely on newer x86 cores, but really badly on some older ones.
Al Viro is looking at cleaning up all our user copy routines to make
this all a non-issue, but for now we have this simple-but-stupid version
for x86 that works fine for the dirent name copy case because those
names are short strings and we simply don't need anything fancier.

Make filldir[64]() verify the directory entry filename is valid
[ Upstream commit 8a23eb804ca4f2be909e372cf5a9e7b30ae476cd ]
This has been discussed several times, and now filesystem people are
talking about doing it individually at the filesystem layer, so head
that off at the pass and just do it in getdents{64}().
This is partially based on a patch by Jann Horn, but checks for NUL
bytes as well, and somewhat simplified.
There's also commentary about how it might be better if invalid names
due to filesystem corruption don't cause an immediate failure, but only
an error at the end of the readdir(), so that people can still see the
filenames that are ok.
There's also been discussion about just how much POSIX strictly speaking
requires this since it's about filesystem corruption. It's really more
"protect user space from bad behavior" as pointed out by Jann. But
since Eric Biederman looked up the POSIX wording, here it is for context:
"From readdir:
The readdir() function shall return a pointer to a structure
representing the directory entry at the current position in the
directory stream specified by the argument dirp, and position the
directory stream at the next entry. It shall return a null pointer
upon reaching the end of the directory stream. The structure dirent
defined in the  header describes a directory entry.
From definitions:
3.129 Directory Entry (or Link)
An object that associates a filename with a file. Several directory
entries can associate names with the same file.
...
3.169 Filename
A name consisting of 1 to {NAME\_MAX} bytes used to name a file. The
characters composing the name may be selected from the set of all
character values excluding the slash character and the null byte. The
filenames dot and dot-dot have special meaning. A filename is
sometimes referred to as a 'pathname component'."
Note that I didn't bother adding the checks to any legacy interfaces
that nobody uses.
Also note that if this ends up being noticeable as a performance
regression, we can fix that to do a much more optimized model that
checks for both NUL and '/' at the same time one word at a time.
We haven't really tended to optimize 'memchr()', and it only checks for
one pattern at a time anyway, and we really \_should\_ check for NUL too
(but see the comment about "soft errors" in the code about why it
currently only checks for '/')
See the CONFIG\_DCACHE\_WORD\_ACCESS case of hash\_name() for how the name
lookup code looks for pathname terminating characters in parallel.

elf: don't use MAP\_FIXED\_NOREPLACE for elf executable mappings
[ Upstream commit b212921b13bda088a004328457c5c21458262fe2 ]
In commit 4ed28639519c ("fs, elf: drop MAP\_FIXED usage from elf\_map") we
changed elf to use MAP\_FIXED\_NOREPLACE instead of MAP\_FIXED for the
executable mappings.
Then, people reported that it broke some binaries that had overlapping
segments from the same file, and commit ad55eac74f20 ("elf: enforce
MAP\_FIXED on overlaying elf segments") re-instated MAP\_FIXED for some
overlaying elf segment cases. But only some - despite the summary line
of that commit, it only did it when it also does a temporary brk vma for
one obvious overlapping case.
Now Russell King reports another overlapping case with old 32-bit x86
binaries, which doesn't trigger that limited case. End result: we had
better just drop MAP\_FIXED\_NOREPLACE entirely, and go back to MAP\_FIXED.
Yes, it's a sign of old binaries generated with old tool-chains, but we
do pride ourselves on not breaking existing setups.
This still leaves MAP\_FIXED\_NOREPLACE in place for the load\_elf\_interp()
and the old load\_elf\_library() use-cases, because nobody has reported
breakage for those. Yet.
Note that in all the cases seen so far, the overlapping elf sections
seem to be just re-mapping of the same executable with different section
attributes. We could possibly introduce a new MAP\_FIXED\_NOFILECHANGE
flag or similar, which acts like NOREPLACE, but allows just remapping
the same executable file using different protection flags.
It's not clear that would make a huge difference to anything, but if
people really hate that "elf remaps over previous maps" behavior, maybe
at least a more limited form of remapping would alleviate some concerns.
Alternatively, we should take a look at our elf\_map() logic to see if we
end up not mapping things properly the first time.
In the meantime, this is the minimal "don't do that then" patch while
people hopefully think about it more.

Convert filldir[64]() from \_\_put\_user() to unsafe\_put\_user()
[ Upstream commit 9f79b78ef74436c7507bac6bfb7b8b989263bccb ]
We really should avoid the "\_\_{get,put}\_user()" functions entirely,
because they can easily be mis-used and the original intent of being
used for simple direct user accesses no longer holds in a post-SMAP/PAN
world.
Manually optimizing away the user access range check makes no sense any
more, when the range check is generally much cheaper than the "enable
user accesses" code that the \_\_{get,put}\_user() functions still need.
So instead of \_\_put\_user(), use the unsafe\_put\_user() interface with
user\_access\_{begin,end}() that really does generate better code these
days, and which is generally a nicer interface. Under some loads, the
multiple user writes that filldir() does are actually quite noticeable.
This also makes the dirent name copy use unsafe\_put\_user() with a couple
of macros. We do not want to make function calls with SMAP/PAN
disabled, and the code this generates is quite good when the
architecture uses "asm goto" for unsafe\_put\_user() like x86 does.
Note that this doesn't bother with the legacy cases. Nobody should use
them anyway, so performance doesn't really matter there.

namespace: fix namespace.pl script to support relative paths
[ Upstream commit 82fdd12b95727640c9a8233c09d602e4518e71f7 ]
The namespace.pl script does not work properly if objtree is not set to
an absolute path. The do\_nm function is run from within the find
function, which changes directories.
Because of this, appending objtree, $File::Find::dir, and $source, will
return a path which is not valid from the current directory.
This used to work when objtree was set to an absolute path when using
"make namespacecheck". It appears to have not worked when calling
./scripts/namespace.pl directly.
This behavior was changed in 7e1c04779efd ("kbuild: Use relative path
for $(objtree)", 2014-05-14)
Rather than fixing the Makefile to set objtree to an absolute path, just
fix namespace.pl to work when srctree and objtree are relative. Also fix
the script to use an absolute path for these by default.
Use the File::Spec module for this purpose. It's been part of perl
5 since 5.005.
The curdir() function is used to get the current directory when the
objtree and srctree aren't set in the environment.
rel2abs() is used to convert possibly relative objtree and srctree
environment variables to absolute paths.
Finally, the catfile() function is used instead of string appending
paths together, since this is more robust when joining paths together.

MII\_CTRL1000 register, which contains the gigabit advertisement, does
neither. This can lead to phylib's copy of the advertisement becoming
de-synced with the values in the PHY register set, which can result in
incorrect negotiation resolution.

net: phy: allow for reset line to be tied to a sleepy GPIO controller
[ Upstream commit ea977d19d918324ad5b66953f051a6ed07d0a3c5 ]
mdio\_device\_reset() makes use of the atomic-pretending API flavor for
handling the PHY reset GPIO line.
I found no hint that mdio\_device\_reset() is called from atomic context
and indeed it uses usleep\_range() since long time, so I would assume that
it is OK to sleep there.
This patch switch to gpiod\_set\_value\_cansleep() in mdio\_device\_reset().
This is relevant if e.g. the PHY reset line is tied to a I2C GPIO
controller.
This has been tested on a ZynqMP board running an upstream 4.19 kernel and
then hand-ported on current kernel tree.

r8152: Set macpassthru in reset\_resume callback
[ Upstream commit a54cdeeb04fc719e4c7f19d6e28dba7ea86cee5b ]
r8152 may fail to establish network connection after resume from system
suspend.
If the USB port connects to r8152 lost its power during system suspend,
the MAC address was written before is lost. The reason is that The MAC
address doesn't get written again in its reset\_resume callback.
So let's set MAC address again in reset\_resume callback. Also remove
unnecessary lock as no other locking attempt will happen during

libkvm.a(assert.o): relocation R\_X86\_64\_32 against `.rodata.str1.1' can not be used when making a PIE object; recompile with -fPIC
This error is seen when build is done from the main Makefile using
kselftest target. In this case KBUILD\_CPPFLAGS and CC\_OPTION\_CFLAGS
are defined.
When build is invoked using:
"make -C tools/testing/selftests/kvm" KBUILD\_CPPFLAGS and CC\_OPTION\_CFLAGS
aren't defined.
There is no need to pass in KBUILD\_CPPFLAGS and CC\_OPTION\_CFLAGS for the
check to determine if --no-pie is necessary, which is the case when these
two aren't defined when "make -C tools/testing/selftests/kvm" runs.
Fix it by simplifying the no-pie-option logic. With this change, both

riscv: Fix memblock reservation for device tree blob
[ Upstream commit 922b0375fc93fb1a20c5617e37c389c26bbccb70 ]
This fixes an error with how the FDT blob is reserved in memblock.
An incorrect physical address calculation exposed the FDT header to
unintended corruption, which typically manifested with of\_fdt\_raw\_init()
faulting during late boot after fdt\_totalsize() returned a wrong value.
Systems with smaller physical memory sizes more frequently trigger this
issue, as the kernel is more likely to allocate from the DMA32 zone
where bbl places the DTB after the kernel image.
Commit 671f9a3e2e24 ("RISC-V: Setup initial page tables in two stages")
changed the mapping of the DTB to reside in the fixmap area.
Consequently, early\_init\_fdt\_reserve\_self() cannot be used anymore in
setup\_bootmem() since it relies on \_\_pa() to derive a physical address,
which does not work with dtb\_early\_va that is no longer a valid kernel
logical address.
The reserved[0x1] region shows the effect of the pointer underflow
resulting from the \_\_pa(initial\_boot\_params) offset subtraction:
[ 0.000000] MEMBLOCK configuration:
[ 0.000000] memory size = 0x000000001fe00000 reserved size = 0x0000000000a2e514

With the fix applied:

loop: change queue block size to match when using DIO
[ Upstream commit 85560117d00f5d528e928918b8f61cadcefff98b ]
The loop driver assumes that if the passed in fd is opened with
O\_DIRECT, the caller wants to use direct I/O on the loop device.
However, if the underlying block device has a different block size than
the loop block queue, direct I/O can't be enabled. Instead of requiring
userspace to manually change the blocksize and re-enable direct I/O,
just change the queue block sizes to match, as well as the io\_min size.

blk-mq: honor IO scheduler for multiqueue devices
[ Upstream commit a12de1d42d74ef3c80e9fb9a2da94daaef747869 ]
If a device is using multiple queues, the IO scheduler may be bypassed.
This may hurt performance for some slow MQ devices, and it also breaks
zoned devices which depend on mq-deadline for respecting the write order
in one zone.
Don't bypass io scheduler if we have one setup.
This patch can double sequential write performance basically on MQ
scsi\_debug when mq-deadline is applied.

As a result, it is not possible to implement IOL's NVMe Conformance

This issue has been already discussed [2], but without a solution.
This patch solves the problem by adding new ioctls with a new
passthru structure, including 64-bit results. The older ioctls stay
unchanged.

By default, the NVMe/RDMA driver should support max io\_size of 1MiB (or
upto the maximum supported size by the HCA). Currently, one will see that
/sys/class/block//queue/max\_hw\_sectors\_kb is 1020 instead of 1024.
A non power of 2 value can cause performance degradation due to
unnecessary splitting of IO requests and unoptimized allocation units.

need to reduce max\_sectors by 1.

nvme-pci: Save PCI state before putting drive into deepest state
[ Upstream commit 7cbb5c6f9aa7cfda7175d82a9cf77a92965b0c5e ]
The action of saving the PCI state will cause numerous PCI configuration
space reads which depending upon the vendor implementation may cause
the drive to exit the deepest NVMe state.
In these cases ASPM will typically resolve the PCIe link state and APST
may resolve the NVMe power state. However it has also been observed
that this register access after quiesced will cause PC10 failure
on some device combinations.
To resolve this, move the PCI state saving to before SetFeatures has been
called. This has been proven to resolve the issue across a 5000 sample
test on previously failing disk/system combinations.

This code is currently unable to find the dts opp tables as ti-cpufreq

We stopped initializing the opp tables with platform code years ago for
device tree based booting with commit 92d51856d740 ("ARM: OMAP3+: do not
register non-dt OPP tables for device tree boot"), and all of mach-omap2
is now booting using device tree.

omap2\_set\_init\_voltage: unable to set vdd\_mpu

omap2\_set\_init\_voltage: unable to find boot up OPP for vdd\_iva

[ Upstream commit 17529d43b21c72466e9109d602c6f5c360a1a9e8 ]
TRM "Table 13-34. SYSCONFIG Register Field Descriptions" lists both
standbymode and idlemode that should be just the sidle and midle
registers where midle is currently unconfigured for lcdc\_sysc. As
the dts data has been generated based on lcdc\_sysc, we now have an
empty "ti,sysc-midle" property.
And so we currently get a warning for lcdc because of a difference
with dts provided configuration compared to the legacy platform
data. This is because lcdc has SYSC\_HAS\_MIDLEMODE configured in
the platform data without configuring the modes.
Let's fix the issue by adding the missing midlemode to lcdc\_sysc,
and configuring the "ti,sysc-midle" property based on the TRM
values.

ARM: OMAP2+: Fix missing reset done flag for am3 and am43
[ Upstream commit 8ad8041b98c665b6147e607b749586d6e20ba73a ]
For ti,sysc-omap4 compatible devices with no sysstatus register, we do have
reset done status available in the SOFTRESET bit that clears when the reset
is done. This is documented for example in am437x TRM for DMTIMER\_TIOCP\_CFG
register. The am335x TRM just says that SOFTRESET bit value 1 means reset is
ongoing, but it behaves the same way clearing after reset is done.
With the ti-sysc driver handling this automatically based on no sysstatus
register defined, we see warnings if SYSC\_HAS\_RESET\_STATUS is missing in the
legacy platform data:
ti-sysc 48042000.target-module: sysc\_flags 00000222 != 00000022
ti-sysc 48044000.target-module: sysc\_flags 00000222 != 00000022
ti-sysc 48046000.target-module: sysc\_flags 00000222 != 00000022
...
Let's fix these warnings by adding SYSC\_HAS\_RESET\_STATUS. Let's also
remove the useless parentheses while at it.
If it turns out we do have ti,sysc-omap4 compatible devices without a
working SOFTRESET bit we can set up additional quirk handling for it.

scsi: ufs: skip shutdown if hba is not powered
[ Upstream commit f51913eef23f74c3bd07899dc7f1ed6df9e521d8 ]
In some cases, hba may go through shutdown flow without successful
initialization and then make system hang.
For example, if ufshcd\_change\_power\_mode() gets error and leads to
ufshcd\_hba\_exit() to release resources of the host, future shutdown flow
may hang the system since the host register will be accessed in unpowered
state.
To solve this issue, simply add checking to skip shutdown for above kind of
situation.

nvme-pci: Fix a race in controller removal
[ Upstream commit b224726de5e496dbf78147a66755c3d81e28bdd2 ]
User space programs like udevd may try to read to partitions at the
same time the driver detects a namespace is unusable, and may deadlock
if revalidate\_disk() is called while such a process is waiting to
enter the frozen queue. On detecting a dead namespace, move the disk
revalidate after unblocking dispatchers that may be holding bd\_butex.

ARM: dts: Fix wrong clocks for dra7 mcasp
[ Upstream commit 2d3c8ba3cffa00f76bedb713c8c2126c82d8cd13 ]
The ahclkr clkctrl clock bit 28 only exists for mcasp 1 and 2 on dra7.
This causes the following warning on beagle-x15:
ti-sysc 48468000.target-module: could not add child clock ahclkr: -19
Also the mcasp clkctrl clock bits are wrong:
For mcasp1 and 2 we have four clocks at bits 28, 24, 22 and 0:
bit 28 is ahclkr
bit 24 is ahclkx
bit 22 is auxclk
bit 0 is fck
For mcasp3 to 8 we have three clocks at bits 24, 22 and 0.
bit 24 is ahclkx
bit 22 is auxclk
bit 0 is fck
We do not have currently mapped auxclk at bit 22 for the drivers, that can
be added if needed.

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the OverlayFS and ShiftFS Drivers in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle reference counting during memory mapping

operations when used in conjunction with AUFS. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15794](/security/CVE-2019-15794))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-17133](/security/CVE-2019-17133))

It was discovered that the ARM Komeda display driver for the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-18810](/security/CVE-2019-18810))

It was discovered that the VirtualBox guest driver implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19048](/security/CVE-2019-19048))

It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19060](/security/CVE-2019-19060), [CVE-2019-19061](/security/CVE-2019-19061))

It was discovered that the Intel OPA Gen1 Infiniband Driver for the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19065](/security/CVE-2019-19065))

It was discovered that the AMD Audio Coprocessor driver for the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker with the ability to load modules could use this to cause a

denial of service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19067](/security/CVE-2019-19067))

It was discovered in the Qualcomm FastRPC Driver for the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19069](/security/CVE-2019-19069))

It was discovered that the Cascoda CA8210 SPI 802.15.4 wireless controller

driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain

error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19075](/security/CVE-2019-19075))

It was discovered that the AMD Display Engine Driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attack could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19083](/security/CVE-2019-19083))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the Chelsio T4/T5 RDMA Driver for the Linux

kernel performed DMA from a kernel stack. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-17075](/security/CVE-2019-17075))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
