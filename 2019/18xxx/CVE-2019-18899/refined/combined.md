| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-25 15:01:36 UTC  ``` Another finding from [bug 1150532](show_bug.cgi?id=1150532 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - AUDIT-1: apt-cacher-ng: review of cron job file(s): /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng"). The apt-cacher-ng cron job runs the `acngtool` like this by default:  ``` /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool maint -c /etc/apt-cacher-ng SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket ```  It turns out the apt-cacher-ng daemon opens a localhost socket on port 3142 by default but also a UNIX domain socket in /var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket.  Even though the SocketPath is explicitly passed to acngtool, the tool prefers the localhost communication via port 3142. This could allow a local attacker to bind to port 3142 to setup a fake apt-cacher-ng service that the acngtool will then talk to. This works when the attacker wins a race against systemd trying to start the daemon. Of if the daemon is simply not enabled at all, or crashes.  Since apt-cacher-ng also supports credentials and no peer verification is done by default, the cron job would send those credentials to the unprivileged local user. Therefore is this a serious information leak.  The bug is coming from the upstream code. I've traced it back to source/acngtool.cc:503 where the following happens:  ``` 	auto nips = Tokenize(cfg::bindaddr, SPACECHARS, hostips, true); 	if (!nips) 		hostips.emplace_back("localhost"); ```  So if no explicit BinAddr was configured in the config files then localhost is used. The SocketPath passed on the command line seems to be ignored.  I will need to report this to upstream which I will do tomorrow. Please treat this as confidential for the moment until I could offer coordinated disclosure to upstream. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 14:03:05 UTC  ``` I wrote an email to the upstream maintainer describing the problem. Let's see what he says. The following is a PoC for the weakness:  ``` root # grep AdminAuth /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf AdminAuth: mooma:moopa  root # systemctl stop apt-cacher-ng  user $ nc -l -p 3142  root # /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng  GET /acng-report.html?doExpire=Start%2bExpiration&abortOnErrors=aOe HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Debian Apt-Cacher-NG/2 Host: localhost Authorization: Basic bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE= Cache-Control: no-store,no-cache,max-age=0 Accept: application/octet-stream Accept-Encoding: identity Connection: close ```  user $ echo 'bW9vbWE6bW9vcGE=' | base64 -d mooma:moopa ``` ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-27 14:32:23 UTC  ``` The Debian maintainer responded quickly to my report. He acknowledges the issue as described in this bug. It seems they will need an embargo period, because the fix will require more than just a few lines of code. We didn't agree upon a fixed embargo period yet. I will update when I know more.  Since this is now officially an embargoed bug please don't publish any information about this issue until the security team lifts the embargo. This also includes not submitting a bugfix or description of this issue to the OBS. Thank you! ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 10:53:30 UTC  ``` I've discussed a first patch proposal with Debian upstream. There was no reply for some days now. The debian security team also didn't react yet. They will supposedly assign a DSA (Debian-Security-Advisory) and CVE on their end. When a final patch is agreed upon I will share it in this bug. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-15 13:09:20 UTC  ``` So Debian upstream somehow made an uncoordinate release of this security bugfix. Basically the CVE and the related information is already public [1]. Not everything is finished yet on Debian side but since the information is public we can publish ourselves just as well.  I will take care of this bug since no maintainer could be found so far.  Since the package is in such a bad state the proactive security team agreed to do the following:  - file a delete request for apt-cacher-ng in Factory. - submit a maintenance update for apt-cacher-ng in maintained Leap versions   that fixes the issues the best we can.  [1]: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-5202> ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-20 14:20:14 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157706) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/765843> 15.1 / apt-cacher-ng ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-21 09:36:23 UTC  ``` I published this on oss-sec [1].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-25 14:51:59 UTC  ``` A serious finding from [bug 1150532](show_bug.cgi?id=1150532 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - AUDIT-1: apt-cacher-ng: review of cron job file(s): /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng"). In our package apt-cacher-ng runs as root. The /run/apt-cacher-ng directory is owned by an unprivileged user, however:  $ ls -lhd /run/apt-cacher-ng drwxr-xr-x 2 apt-cacher-ng apt-cacher-ng 80 25. Nov 15:30 /run/apt-cacher-ng/  The apt-cacher-ng daemon creates at least two files in there, a pid file and a socket file. The apt-cacher-ng unprivileged user can therefore perform symlink attacks and cause damage to the system or otherwise unspecified impact. Both files are created in a racy way by the apt-cacher-ng daemon.  The problem stems from the apt-cacher-ng.service file which is not coming from upstream but from our own packaging in OBS. On Debian they use the right approach by adding the following two directives to the file:  ``` User=apt-cacher-ng Group=apt-cacher-ng ```  This finding is worth a CVE, we will need to assign one from our own SUSE CVE pool for this since it is SUSE specific. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-12-05 10:51:24 UTC  ``` So this SUSE specific bug needs to be carefully adressed. Reducing permissions in an update is a difficile thing to do. We need to make sure that no regressions occur.  No official maintainer is left for apt-cacher-ng. We're considering to remove it from Factory, but it's still in maintained state for SLE-15 and SLE-15-SP1 backports. The question also is whether there's a customer requirement for this being in SLE, then removing it from Factory could become difficult. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2019-12-05 11:26:15 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2019-18899 to track this ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-15 13:12:34 UTC  ``` Since [bug 1157706](show_bug.cgi?id=1157706 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2020-5202: apt-cacher-ng: acngtool uses localhost connection instead of socket by default") which also affects upstream is already public we can now simply act for this bug, too. Similarly to what I wrote in the other bug, no maintainer is to be found for this package in openSUSE. Therefore the following will happen:  - a delete request will be filed for Factory - a maintenance update with emergency fixes will be submitted to maintained   Leap codestreams. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-20 14:20:10 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157703) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/765843> 15.1 / apt-cacher-ng ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157703#c9)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-21 09:33:22 UTC  ``` I've published this on oss-sec [1].

# CVE-2020-5202

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-4788.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-5204.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-5202 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5202)

#### Description

apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive information by hijacking the hardcoded TCP port. The /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect to apt-cacher-ng via TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicit SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line option is passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active by default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged port, any local user can try to bind to this port and will receive requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive data in these requests, e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf. This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage to bind to this port before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can.
