Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of brute-force protection for 2FA codes in the Pimcore login process. Specifically, the `BruteforceProtectionHandler` was not being correctly invoked when an invalid 2FA code was entered.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   The `BruteforceProtectionHandler`'s check was only called when a session was available, and not during the initial 2FA code verification.
    *   When an `AuthenticationException` occurred due to an invalid 2FA code, the handler was called *after* the error message was displayed, meaning an attacker could potentially try multiple 2FA codes rapidly.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially brute-force 2FA codes because no rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms were in place to prevent multiple failed attempts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the login page with 2FA enabled, where an attacker would repeatedly submit different 2FA codes in an attempt to bypass the 2FA mechanism.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page and know a valid username and have some information that they're attempting to brute-force a user with 2FA enabled.

**Code Changes:**

The commit `9f2d075243a8392c114d9a8028858b9faf041e2d` addresses the issue in `LoginController.php`:

*   **Before:** The `BruteforceProtectionHandler->checkProtection()` method is called only if the request has a session. If an `AuthenticationException` occurs during the 2FA process the entry is added to the handler *after* the error is shown to the user.
*   **After:** The `BruteforceProtectionHandler->checkProtection()` is called on the `twoFactorAuthenticationAction()` to ensure that checks are performed when a 2FA code is submitted. The entry is added when the request has a session *and* an `AuthenticationException` has occurred.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The second file changed, `UserController.php`, has a change that appears unrelated to this vulnerability. The lines removed do not seem to relate to the brute-force protection.
-   The provided content is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
-   The commit message `Brute-force attack protection for 2fa codes` accurately describes the fix.
