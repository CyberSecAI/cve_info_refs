- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of network packets sent to port 1099/tcp on the Application Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Exposure of sensitive information. The server discloses path and filenames.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to path and filenames on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specifically crafted packets to port 1099/tcp on the Application Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the Application Server.
