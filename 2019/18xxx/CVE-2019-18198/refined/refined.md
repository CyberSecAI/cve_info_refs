Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2019-18198:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2019-18198. The commit log from git.kernel.org and github.com explicitly references the fix for a bug that is associated with this CVE, specifically mentioning a reference counting issue with IPv6 routing rules. The Launchpad bug report also identifies CVE-2019-18198 as the identifier for the reported issue. The NetApp advisory also includes CVE-2019-18198 in its list of vulnerabilities.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability**

The root cause is a reference counting error in the Linux kernel's IPv6 routing rule suppression code. Specifically, when a routing rule with the `FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` flag is set for suppressing routing lookups, the corresponding route is incorrectly freed, which may lead to a use-after-free condition.  This occurs when the route is no longer referenced, and `ip6_rt_put()` is called, but subsequent operations expect the route to be valid.

The issue was introduced by commit 7d9e5f422150 ("ipv6: convert major tx path to use RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF"), which removed a reference from certain dsts but didn't update the fib6 suppression code accordingly.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**

-   **Incorrect Reference Counting:** The `fib6_rule_suppress` function was freeing the route (`rt`) even when the `FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` flag was set, meaning the route's reference should not be decremented and freed, leading to a potential double free.
-   **Use-After-Free:** After the premature freeing of the route object, subsequent accesses to this object could lead to a use-after-free condition and subsequent crashes.

**4. Impact of exploitation**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged local attacker, triggering a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service. A test case using the `ip` command is given which shows how to trigger the crash.
-   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Launchpad bug report also mentions "or possibly execute arbitrary code" due to the use-after-free, although no specific details or exploit code is presented, implying this is a possible but more complex outcome of the vulnerability.

**5. Attack vectors**

-   **Local Access:**  The vulnerability is exploitable by local users. The provided test case from the launchpad bug report demonstrates this can be triggered without root privileges by using `unshare -rUn` and the `ip` command to set up the faulty conditions.
-   **Specific IPv6 Rule:** The attack vector requires the configuration of a specific type of IPv6 routing rule using the  `ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0` which makes the routing infrastructure attempt to suppress lookups with the NOREF flag. This setting was often triggered by Wireguard configurations.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position**

-   **Local User Access:** The attacker requires only local user access on the vulnerable system.
-   **`ip` Command Usage:** The attacker needs the ability to use the `ip` command (or similar functionality through custom code).
-   **IPv6 Support:** IPv6 needs to be enabled on the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**

-   The patch added an additional check in `fib6_rule_suppress()` to avoid freeing the route if `FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` was set.
-   A test case was added to `tools/testing/selftests/net/fib_tests.sh` to verify the fix.
- The fix was introduced in Ubuntu with package linux version `5.3.0-19.20`.
-   The NetApp advisory indicates a range of their products are impacted, spanning multiple device types, firmware controllers and cloud services.
