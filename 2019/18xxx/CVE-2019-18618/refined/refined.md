CVE-2019-18618:
  - Root cause: Incorrect access control in the firmware of Synaptics VFS75xx family fingerprint sensors.
  - Weakness: Allows injection of an unverified partition table.
  - Impact: Compromises the confidentiality of sensor data. Future fingerprint templates enrolled after the attack can be retrieved and decrypted. After a reset operation, an attacker could subsequently access data in the communications between the host and device as this vulnerability has compromised the fixed global keys used to secure the initial "pairing" operation. A sensor that is suffering from this exploit will become non-functional.
  - Attack vector: A local administrator or physical attacker can send commands to the device to reset it, install a partition table with an invalid entry, and then use device APIs to read/write data.
  - Required attacker capabilities: Administrator or physical access to send commands to the device.
