Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-18216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The BIOS on the ASUS ROG GM501GS laptop uses the main battery as its power source, rather than a separate battery.
*   When the main battery is fully discharged, the BIOS settings are reset to default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Separate BIOS Battery:** The critical flaw is the absence of a dedicated battery for maintaining the BIOS configuration.
*   **BIOS Reset on Battery Depletion:**  Complete battery discharge leads to the BIOS resetting to factory defaults, effectively bypassing any security configurations.
*   **Vulnerability to Physical Attack:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by draining the laptop's battery, forcing a BIOS reset and allowing them to circumvent BIOS security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass BIOS Security:**  Attackers can bypass BIOS passwords, disable secure boot, and change boot order settings. This could also allow access to disabled features like virtualization.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With the BIOS settings reset, attackers can boot from external media (e.g., USB drives) to gain access to the operating system and data on the hard drive, bypassing BIOS level security.
*   **Loss of Security Controls**: Security features like boot order restrictions, password protection, and virtualization controls are lost, making the system more susceptible to unauthorized access and malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** Requires physical access to the target laptop.
*   **Battery Depletion:**  The attacker needs to fully deplete the laptop's battery through normal use or by leaving the laptop on until the battery dies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Possession:** The attacker must have physical possession of the laptop to execute the exploit.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Laptop Operation:** An attacker needs to know how to deplete the laptop battery and how to trigger a reboot after plugging in a charger.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the blog author on their ASUS ROG GM501GS laptop.
*   The author contacted the ASUS security team, who initially stated it was normal behavior, but later acknowledged it as a vulnerability.
*   ASUS provided a BIOS patch that resolves the issue.
*   The blog post provides a detailed step-by-step process for reproducing the vulnerability.
* The affected BIOS version was 313 (according to the latest version dated 08/30/2019)
