## CVE-2019-18200

This entry provides details regarding the Keystroke Injection Vulnerability in the Fujitsu Wireless Keyboard Set LX390 (Model No. GK381).

**Root Cause:** Insecure implementation of data communication. The wireless keyboard data communication is unencrypted and unauthenticated. The data whitening/scrambling mechanism used by the 2.4 GHz radio transceiver is insecurely implemented.

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Keystroke Injection:** An attacker can send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's computer.
*   **Missing Encryption:** The data communication between the keyboard and receiver is unencrypted.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The data communication between the keyboard and receiver is unauthenticated.

**Impact:**

*   Remote control of the victim's computer.
*   Access to sensitive data like login credentials.
*   Malware installation on unattended, screen-locked systems (in conjunction with replay attack vulnerability SYSS-2019-009).

**Attack Vector:** By analyzing the radio communication protocol, an attacker can learn the data whitening configuration and send arbitrary keystrokes.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Attacker needs to be within radio range of the target system.
*   Attacker needs the ability to analyze and inject radio communication (using software-defined radio or a USB radio dongle like Crazyradio PA).
*   Knowledge of the data whitening configuration for the targeted keyboard. This can be learned by remotely analyzing the radio communication.
