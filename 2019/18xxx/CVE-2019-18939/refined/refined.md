Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-18939:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an Improper Access Control vulnerability in the 'HM-Print' AddOn for eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3 devices. The `exec.cgi` and `exec1.cgi` scripts within the addon execute TCL script content from an HTTP POST request without authentication or authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The `exec.cgi` and `exec1.cgi` scripts allow execution of TCL scripts without authentication.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The ability to execute arbitrary TCL scripts via HTTP POST requests allows for Remote Code Execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Homematic CCU device.
- **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control of the device, including the ability to:
   - Read and modify system data.
   - Install malware.
   - Stop services.
   - Pivot to other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `exec.cgi` or `exec1.cgi` scripts within the ‘HM-Print’ AddOn.
- **Web Interface:** The attacker needs access to the web interface of the Homematic CCU.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Homematic CCU web interface, which may be exposed to the local network or the internet (if port forwarding is enabled).
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoints:** The attacker must know about `exec.cgi` or `exec1.cgi` path.
- **Knowledge of the `system.Exec` call, or another mechanism to run commands:** The attacker needs to understand how to embed system commands inside TCL for execution, or have knowledge of other command execution primitives (such as CUxD `CMD_EXEC`).

**Additional Details:**
- The content mentions that if the CUxD AddOn is also installed, attackers could also exploit the vulnerability using the `dom.GetObject("CUxD.CUX2801001:1.CMD_EXEC").State()` to execute system commands within the `exec.cgi` or `exec1.cgi` scripts.
- The affected 'HM-Print' AddOn versions are 2.2, 2.1, 1.2a, and prior.
- A patch was released in version 2.3 of the HM-Print addon.
- The vendor eQ-3 stated they were "not responsible for AddOns"

This information provides more detail than the official CVE description, clarifying the specific attack vector, impacted versions, and the possibility of using CUxD for further RCE.
