Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the AbuseFilter extension handles the visibility of different versions of abuse filters. While older, hidden versions of a filter were not directly accessible via their specific URLs, the diff view between versions was accessible to all users, including those without sysop rights. This allowed them to reconstruct the contents of hidden filter versions by comparing the differences between public and hidden versions, or even between hidden versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The core issue is the unintended exposure of filter details that were supposed to be hidden, which constitutes an information leak.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The diff functionality did not properly check the visibility permissions of the filter versions being compared, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Filter Logic:** Attackers could potentially gain access to the logic of hidden abuse filters.
*   **Circumvention of Security Measures:** By knowing how a hidden filter works, attackers might be able to circumvent it.
*   **Abuse Filter Manipulation:** Depending on the filter's complexity and function, an attacker might be able to deduce ways to manipulate the system or abuse the platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Diff URLs:** Attackers could directly access the diff URLs of a specific abuse filter, comparing hidden versions with the public current version, or with other hidden versions.
    *   Example:  `https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezial:Missbrauchsfilter/history/3/diff/prev/40` (diff between version 40, which is hidden, and the previous version)
        *   `https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezial:Missbrauchsfilter/history/3/diff/prev/42` (diff between version 42 and the previous version)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Knowledge of Abuse Filters:** An attacker would need to be aware of the existence and location of Abuse Filters in the MediaWiki setup.
*   **MediaWiki User:** The attacker would need to be a user of the MediaWiki platform to access the diff URLs.
*   **No sysop access required:** This vulnerability could be exploited by any user without special privileges.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the visibility of each version is checked before displaying the diff, and hiding the "newer change" button at the bottom of a diff right before a hidden version.
