- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the MS3000 server's RPC service. An attacker can send specifically crafted objects to this service, triggering the vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted upload of files with dangerous types
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the MS3000 server.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the MS3000 server is required. The attacker then sends crafted objects to one of the RPC services.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the MS3000 server. No authentication is explicitly required.
