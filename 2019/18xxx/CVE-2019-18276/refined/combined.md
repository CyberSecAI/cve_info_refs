| [Description](#c0)  Hank Leininger    2019-12-10 18:52:01 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-18276 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18276>):    An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through   5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to   its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real   UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support   "saved UID" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with   command execution in the shell can use "enable -f" for runtime loading of a   new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore   regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are   unaffected.  Note I think actual exposure to this should be minor, because setuid bash is a bad idea anyway, and the normal way for a privileged process (sshd, /bin/login, etc.) to launch bash as a user is to fork, drop privs, and then exec.  If they do so correctly, bash won't have any privs to misuse; if they do not, that is a bug in them.  There is a patch sitting in bash's devel branch, mixed in with other changes:  <https://github.com/bminor/bash/commit/951bdaad7a18cc0dc1036bba86b18b90874d39ff>  The latest release version, 5.0_p11, does not include the fix (despite p11 being released well after that fix was added to devel).  I will submit a PR that includes a trimmed-down version of this patch to include only the relevant fixes. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-05-02 22:11:35 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/13941#issuecomment-564759598>  "The vulnerability requires suid what we don't do and therefore is not exploitable on reasonable configurations."  @maintainer(s), is this included in [bug 719942](show_bug.cgi?id=719942 "RESOLVED FIXED - app-shells/bash-5.0_p17 stable request")? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Mike Gilbert   gentoo-dev  2020-05-03 02:39:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Sam James (sec padawan) from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=702488#c1)) > @maintainer(s), is this included in [bug 719942](show_bug.cgi?id=719942 "RESOLVED FIXED - app-shells/bash-5.0_p17 stable request")?

# Bash: Privilege escalation — GLSA **202105-34**

A vulnerability in Bash may allow users to escalate privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-shells/bash** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0\_p11-r1** |

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

[00:00] I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE ZERO-DAYS. Because this
involves a zero-day in bash.
[00:09] SUIDBASH was a pwnable challenge at the Google
CTF Finals 2019 and none of the teams solved
[00:17] it. The challenge description only says “Yes,
it’s exactly what you think”, there is
[00:23] a server to connect to via netcat, and there
is a file to download. It’s a small .patch
[00:28] file that you can apply to the bash source
to add a new functionality. And who would
[00:32] be better to talk about this challenge, other
than the challenge author, Ian Pudney.
[00:38] But before he tells us more about it, I want
to quickly mention. You need to know what
[00:42] S.U.I.D, suid, or setuid means. If you don’t
know that, please checkout my binary exploitation
[00:49] playlist, specifically episode 0x0b. Starting
at around 3:45.
[00:56] So let’s have a quick look at the challenge
server. We connect with netcat and even though
[01:01] it doesn’t look like it, we have a shell
here. When we type “id” we can see that
[01:05] our user is called user and has the user id
1338.
[01:11] With bash -i we can also get a bit nicer prompt.
Let’s look at the files with ls.
[01:17] And we see a flag file, a read\_flag.sh shell
script and the suidbash binary. And it’s
[01:24] noticeable that all these files belong to
the user flag\_haver. So we as user don’t
[01:31] have the permission to read the flag. But
there is suidbash which is “a tool for running
[01:36] setuid bash scripts”. And you can just pass
in the script as an argument. And we have
[01:42] this get\_flag.sh bash script, which has the
setuid bit set. This script simply asks for
[01:50] a password, then calculates the sha256 hash
of it, and compares it to this hash. If your
[01:56] password is correct, you get the flag. Because
this is a good CTF, you know that there is
[02:01] no guessing bullshit bruteforce wordlist crap
involved. So you can assume that you don’t
[02:07] have to touch this.
But theoretically, if you had the password,
[02:12] then suidbash, so this modified version of
bash, would execute this setuid script, which
[02:17] then runs as the flag\_haver user, and thus
can read the flag.
[02:23] So your goal is to somehow exploit suidbash,
or this get\_flag script, to get the elevated
[02:30] privileges of the flag\_haver user and read
the flag yourself.
[02:36] Now if you would try to create your own script
and just cat the flag, then obviously this
[02:40] wouldn’t work. That would be to easy.
So let’s checkout the code in the provided
[02:46] .patch file. first you can see it renames
the real main() function from the original
[02:51] bash, and adds a new main(). In there it does
a couple of things, for example looks at the
[02:57] file permissions of the bash script, to see
if there is a setuid bit. And after some additional
[03:02] checks are passed, it prepares arguments,
which are later passed to the original main().
[03:08] If you look at the prepared arguments you
can see, that if your script is allowed to
[03:12] run with setuid permissions, then it sets
the -p flag. But if you are not allowed, it
[03:17] will NOT set -p.
So what is -p? The man page for bash writes:
[03:23] “If the shell is started with the effective
user id not equal to the real user id, and
[03:30] the -p option is not supplied, [...], the
effective user id is set to the real user
[03:36] id. “
[03:37] So this means, by default, bash will revert
the actions of setuid, and drop the privileges
[03:44] back to the real user id. But...
[03:46] “If the -p option is supplied at invocation
[...] the effective user id is not reset”
[03:54] So this is basically the patch. If there is
a setuid script and it passes some checks,
[04:00] it will execute real bash with -p, and for
any other scripts, it will keep the default
[04:06] behaviour of dropping the privileges.
[04:09] So how do you now exploit this? Well… no
team solved in the end. So obviously I couldn’t
[04:14] solve this either. And the vulnerability here
is very tricky. As Ian said at the beginning
[04:20] of the video, this involves a 0day in bash.
But luckily I had the privilege to sit down
[04:27] with Ian and hear the story behind this challenge.
So let’s listen and with what we learn from
[04:33] him, we can then go and solve it.
[04:36] The challenge was initially based on an actual
binary that existed called suidperl. In linux
[04:44] you can’t set suid bit on scripts. Or rather
you can but it doesn’t work. And so with
[04:51] perl they produced this binary that would
allow you to execute a setuid perl script
[04:57] as root. Or whichever user owns it. However
it had some vulnerabilities. One of them was
[05:06] … on linux there are actually three user
ids. There is the effective user id, which
[05:11] controls your permissions. There is the real
user id, which is not set from a setuid binary
[05:18] - so it knows what user you are coming from.
And then there is the saved uid. Which exists
[05:26] only as a place where a uid can be put so
that you can drop privileges and still be
[05:32] able to come back to it later. And suidperl
did not correctly set the saved uid.
[05:38] I have a question about the saved uid. Isn’t
that kind of ineffective? Because any process
[05:44] that would taken over with dropped privileges
could just also take the saved?
[05:49] You bring up a good point there. Yes!
When suid perl wanted to drop privileges to
[05:58] whatever user the script was owned by, it
needed to set the effective user id and the
[06:06] saved user id. But it only set the effective.
Meaning the process could take the saved uid
[06:15] and get back those privileges. And the saved
uid was root. Because suidperl was owned by
[06:19] root. And so now it was root.
Okay. And so this challenge is basically implementing
[06:24] the same behaviour, just for bash scripts?
Yes! That was actually initially the challenge.
[06:31] I have written effectively a suidbash that
did exactly that. But then, bash has this
[06:37] behaviour where if you start it from a setuid
context, or mor formally where the effective
[06:42] userid does not equal the real user id. It
will by default drop its privileges down to
[06:48] real. And this had been the exact same bug,
where it does not correctly set the saved
[06:54] uid.
Ohhh.
[06:56] Which means that it’s possible for a bash
script to recover its dropped privileges.
[07:03] Here is the thing so. There is no builtin
that allows you to call setuid syscall. And
[07:10] if you ever fork a child process with exec,
that child binary doesn’t have the saved
[07:16] uid.
Mhmh.
[07:17] So you have to find a way to make bash itself
recover the privileges.
[07:22] And it turns out, bash has the ability to
load builtins at runtime. I know of literally
[07:29] no legitamately use of this feature,. The
only time I have ever seen it used is in a
[07:36] github repo by tarvis ormandy for doing exactly
this. Call foreign function interface.
[07:41] It sounds actually like a doable challenge.
But yeah, the patch itself doesn’t have
[07:45] the vulnerability. The patch itself is just
to facilitate the challenge. But the actual
[07:51] bug is somewhere completely else. So the patch,
the code, doesn’t reveal it.
[07:55] Correct.
Yeah okay makes sense.
[07:57] So yeah, let me check in with you later in
the CTF when a couple of teams have solved
[08:02] it, and when I had a look at it as well. And
maybe we can talk about, maybe you hear even
[08:06] about how some of the teams have solved it.
That would be interesting.
[08:10] Spoiler alert, nobody has solved it. Alright.
Thanks!
[08:14] Okay, obviously we know the solution now and
we can try to solve it! You should now try
[08:19] it yourself! Maybe the CTF server is still
up, or you can set it up locally. Here I use
[08:24] an ubuntu VM with a vulnerable bash version.
First we need a target user, so I create alice.
[08:31] Then we make alice the owner of the bash binary
and set the setuid bit.
[08:35] Now we would imagine, if we execute bash as
a regular user, we would become alice. But
[08:41] when we enter id, we see that bash dropped
the alice privileges and we are just user.
[08:47] We can also see here the effect of -p. If
we do that, and then execute id, we see that
[08:52] bash doesn’t drop the privileges and we
have the effective userid of alice.
[08:57] But we are attacking the case without -p.
Btw it’s important to use this new user
[09:02] alice for this, and don’t try makit it a
root owned setuid.
[09:06] Ian told me that for historical backwards
compatibility reasons, the setuid() function
[09:12] has different behaviour. When it's running
as root, it sets all three uids. If it's not
[09:17] running as root, it sets just the effective
uid. So, the vulnerability exists only if
[09:23] it's running as not-root. He said there's
a reason why he called this the "world's least
[09:29] useful vulnerability".
You can also create a test flag file as alice
[09:33] and prevent others from reading it. You can
use this to test if you got the alice permissions.
[09:39] Now is your last chance to pause and try it
out yourself! 3 2 1. Okay.
[09:45] So after this interview I sat down for a while
and tried to figure out the details. And Ian
[09:49] already mentioned the technical challenge
here, because you need bash itself to call
[09:54] the setuid syscall, to recover the saved uid
privileges. You can’t create a c program
[09:59] and execute it, because upon an exec the saved
uid is lost.
[10:02] And he mentioned that bash has this feature
to load builtins at runtime. And this is a
[10:08] way to get your own code executed inside of
the bash process. And this was actually the
[10:14] hardest part. To figure out how to create
your own bash builtins in c. It’s really
[10:19] difficult to google for that. It took me quite
a bit combing through github and looking for
[10:24] example, until I figured out that it’s very
simple. Basically the enable command in bash
[10:29] allows you to load a shared library and it
then attempts to call a function in it. And
[10:35] in a shared library you can define a constructor
which is execute upon loading it.
[10:41] So we basically just create a dynamic library
with a constructor that calls setuid with
[10:45] the id of the user we target. In case of my
alice ubuntu example it would be 1001, and
[10:53] in case of the challenge, flag\_haver has the
uid 1339. Then you use gcc to compile this
[10:59] first into an object file, and then into a
shared object, a dynamic library.
[11:04] So let’s try this. We execute bash again
and we see that we can’t read the flag and
[11:08] we clearly don’t have alice’s permission.
Now we load this dynamic library with enable
[11:13] -f and libpwn.so and asd.
You can see there is an error, that bash enable
[11:19] tried to find asd\_struct. That’s stuff you
would have to include if you would want to
[11:24] create an actual builtin and load it. Be don’t
care because our constructor was already executed
[11:30] and you can see it updated the effective user
id. When we now check id, we see that we have
[11:36] the euid from alice.
We recovered the dropped privileges from the
[11:41] saved uid!
And now we can read our test flag.
[11:44] Eazy!
Now we just need to reproduce this on the
[11:48] challenge server. And this is again a bit
tricky, because there is no proper editor
[11:51] like vim. So you have to use this trick with
cat to get the file content copied over.
[11:56] So here I create the library source code and
you can see the call to setuid for the flag\_haver.
[12:03] Then we compile it with the two steps we already
know to a shared library.
[12:07] Because suidbash executes shell scripts and
doesn’t give you a proper shell, we now
[12:11] need to create a script that simply loads
this shared library with enable -f.
[12:16] And then it should be able to read the flag.
Make it executable and then call suidbash
[12:21] with this script. ready?
boom! There it is. It worked.
[12:26] Here is the flag.
Zero days are the best days. CVE 2019-18276
[12:32] And we get a small message from Ian.
[12:35] I’m pretty sure that if you combine “world’s
least useful vulnerability” with “affecting
[12:40] every computer on the planet”, those cancel
out and you end up with just “vulnerability”.
[12:46] Right? That’s how it works?
[12:48] I like that!
[12:49] Also, what’s old is new again. Thies challenge
was inspired by CA-1996-12, “suidperl”.
[12:56] But then, after writing the challenge, I decided
to check whether bash’s automatic privilege-dropping
[13:00] feature has a similar issue. Turns out: it
does.
[13:04] I dug up this 1996 CERT advisory document
from carnegie mellon.
[13:09] Vulnerability in suidperl. Original issue
from june 1996.
[13:13] “The CERT Coordination Center has received
reports of a vulnerability in systems that
[13:18] contain the suidperl program and that support
saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID.
[13:24] By exploiting this vulnerability, anyone with
access to an account on such a system may
[13:29] gain root access”
[13:31] Fascinating.
[13:33] Also you may have heard that John Hammond
was also there. He should also upload some
[13:37] videos about the CTF and the events. So checkout
his channel. He also talked with Ian and I
[13:41] threw in a question. Because I wanted to know
how this bash vulnerability was discovered.
[13:47] Who found the 0-day in bash? How was that
discovered?
[13:50] Was that you?
Ok, So, I found the zero-day in bash for the
[13:56] suidbash vulnerability. So I made suidbash
just like suidperl. I made it do all the same
[14:02] things. And have the same privilege dropping
bug. But then I was like: “well, bash has
[14:08] that privilege dropping feature. What if it
has the same vulnerability?” and it did.
[14:14] NICE!
WOW!
[14:15] You ran accidentally into it?
Tripping over my zero-day.
[14:19] You were thinking of introducing a vulnerability,
that was actually in there.
[14:25] Actually at work, a lot of the vulnerabilities
I find are either I just stumble across something.
[14:33] Or I see something in some documentation and
I’m like “that looks like something somebody
[14:37] could mess up. I’m going to investigate
and see if they did.
[14:41] Nice. that’s super cool.
Yah, I think that’s the core of research,right
[14:46] you look for something, how can it be messed
up and then you go out and see if people mess
[14:50] it up. Indeed.
[14:52] And by the way. This vulnerability has somewhat
of an emotional component for me too. Because
[14:58] when I started learning binary exploitation,
I played things like exploit.education, io,
[15:04] overthewire and so forth. And when you exploit
a setuid binary and execute bash, the result
[15:09] would be dropped privileges. And it was very
frustrating when I first ran into this and
[15:15] because I didn’t understand what’s going
on. your exploit was successful but somehow
[15:18] you still couldn’t access the next level.
And so it’s funny to think back and realize
[15:24] that I could have used this vulnerability
to recover the privilege in my shell and solve
[15:29] it after all. I wonder how many people feel
the same way.
