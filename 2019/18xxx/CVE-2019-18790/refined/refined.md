Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-18790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A SIP request can change a SIP peer's IP address in Asterisk. This occurs because the system sets the address of the peer before authentication is successful.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of SIP requests allows an attacker to modify the IP address associated with a SIP peer without proper authentication.
- Specifically, the system updates the peer's IP address before verifying authentication.
- The vulnerability resides in the `channels/chan_sip.c` module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Call Hijacking:** Attackers can redirect calls intended for the legitimate SIP peer to a different destination by changing the associated IP address.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By changing the IP address, attackers can effectively render the legitimate peer unreachable, causing a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted SIP request to Asterisk.
- The attacker needs to know the peer's name but does not need to know any authentication details like passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the Asterisk server.
- The attacker needs to know the name of the SIP peer they want to target.
- The vulnerability is only exploitable when the "nat" option in the Asterisk configuration is set to the default or "auto_force_rport".

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is considered a "Minor" severity issue by the Asterisk project.
- The advisory mentions that using any other option value for "nat" (e.g., "nat=no" or "nat=force_rport") will prevent the attack.
- Fixed versions of Asterisk will no longer set the address of the peer before authentication when a SIP request is received.
- This issue affects several versions of Asterisk, including open-source versions 13.x, 16.x, 17.x, and certified versions 13.21.
- Patches were released to correct this vulnerability in versions 13.29.2, 16.6.2, 17.0.1, and certified Asterisk 13.21-cert5
