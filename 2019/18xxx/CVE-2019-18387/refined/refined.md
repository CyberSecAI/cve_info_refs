- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Hotel and Lodge Management System does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling parameters related to Customers, Rooms, Currency, Room Booking Details, and Tax Details. This allows for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, which could lead to data breaches, modification of data, or complete compromise of the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific PHP files (`edit_customer.php`, `edit_room.php`, `edit_curr.php`, `edit_booking.php`, `edit_tax.php`) using the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed.
