The content is related to CVE-2019-18579.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a BIOS configuration setting that enables "Thunderbolt (and PCIe behind TBT) pre-boot modules" by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure default configuration: The vulnerable setting is enabled by default in the BIOS.
- Direct Memory Access (DMA) vulnerability: The enabled setting allows for unauthorized DMA access during the boot process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local, unauthenticated attacker with physical access can gain read or write access to main memory. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and system manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
Physical access to the vulnerable system is required. The attacker then uses DMA attacks during the boot process to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the target machine
- Ability to perform a DMA attack during the boot process
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability

**Affected products:**
Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (7390) BIOS versions prior to 1.1.3.

**Resolution:**
Update the BIOS to version 1.1.3 or later and restore default BIOS settings.
