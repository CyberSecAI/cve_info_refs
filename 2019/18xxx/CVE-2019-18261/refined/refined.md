- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software lacks sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts (CWE-307), making the system susceptible to brute force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to brute force login credentials, gain unauthorized access to the system, and potentially gain unauthorized access to the FTP interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with network access can attempt to brute-force authentication credentials with low skill level requirements.
