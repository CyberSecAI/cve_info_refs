### @ret2libc **[ret2libc](/ret2libc)** commented [Nov 7, 2019](#issue-519132259)

These files contain loops that convert system data into python objects

and during the process they create objects and dereference their

refcounts after they have been added to the resulting list.

However, in case of errors during the creation of those python objects,

the refcount to previously allocated objects is dropped again with

Py\_XDECREF, which should be a no-op in case the paramater is NULL. Even

so, in most of these loops the variables pointing to the objects are

never set to NULL, even after Py\_DECREF is called at the end of the loop

iteration. This means, after the first iteration, if an error occurs

those python objects will get their refcount dropped two times,

resulting in a possible double-free.

In any case, making functions like PyUnicode\_DecodeFSDefault fail does not seem like an easy thing, as after playing a bit with it, it seems like it fails only when there's not enough memory (or other very particular conditions apply).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Ah, I understand what you mean. `Py_DECREF` does not set the object to NULL, and that's a problem in while/for loops (and only in that case). I think you're right. |

Also, it is not implicit that a variable on the stack is set to NULL. It is an error to assume so in general. I am not sure about python extensions in C, but I do think it is the same, so you should always initialize your local variables before using them. They don't get implicitly set to NULL. |

| They don't get implicitly set to NULL.  Does it depend from the compiler? On Linux + gcc 7.4.0 they do.  It may depend on the compiler, but AFAIK gcc does not automatically initialize local variables. The fact that in some tests you see 0 as value does not mean they will always have. Usually uninitialized local variables just contain the garbage value that was left on the stack. For what I know, the C99 standard says that local variables that are not explicitly initialized may contain any value, so you can't rely on those variable contain 0. |

| Yep. The theoretical risk is being able to create a disk/partition with an invalid character and make `PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault` fail. The double free will result in a segfault. CVE creation was coordinated by Tidelift.  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18874> |

CVE fix commit message by Riccardo Schirone:
Use Py_CLEAR instead of Py_DECREF to also set the variable to NULL

These files contain loops that convert system data into python objects
and during the process they create objects and dereference their
refcounts after they have been added to the resulting list.

However, in case of errors during the creation of those python objects,
the refcount to previously allocated objects is dropped again with
Py_XDECREF, which should be a no-op in case the paramater is NULL. Even
so, in most of these loops the variables pointing to the objects are
never set to NULL, even after Py_DECREF is called at the end of the loop
iteration. This means, after the first iteration, if an error occurs
those python objects will get their refcount dropped two times,
resulting in a possible double-free.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=176836#c0)  Horst H. von Brand    2006-01-03 15:52:22 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When booting, udevd calls nss_ldap (long before the network is set up), and gets a series of tiemeouts for LDAP not being there, finally giving up after some 2 minutes.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): udev-078-3  How reproducible: Each boot  Steps to Reproduce: 1. boot 2. 3.    Actual results: Complaints, LDAP timeouts (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 seconds) before boot continues  Expected results: No delay  Additional info: My i686 notebook doesn't show this (but is not configured to use LDAP either).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=176836#c1)  W. Michael Petullo    2006-01-03 20:13:57 UTC  ``` I have this same problem.  I am using udev-078-3 and have my computer configured to use LDAP for NSS requests.  Udev is started by rc.sysinit well before the network is brought up, therefore the LDAP server is not available.  The error message is:  udev[399]: nss_ldap: reconnecting to LDAP server (sleeping X seconds)...   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=176836#c2)  W. Michael Petullo    2006-01-03 20:19:42 UTC  ``` This is a duplicate of [bug #176605](show_bug.cgi?id=176605 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Udev uses NSS which may require network unavailable during boot").   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=176836#c3)  Harald Hoyer    2006-01-11 09:45:03 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [169725](show_bug.cgi?id=169725 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - udev requires network access for ldap") ***   ``` |  |

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Use Py\_CLEAR instead of Py\_DECREF to also set the variable to NULL ([#…](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/1616)

```
[…1616](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/pull/1616))

These files contain loops that convert system data into python objects
and during the process they create objects and dereference their
refcounts after they have been added to the resulting list.

However, in case of errors during the creation of those python objects,
the refcount to previously allocated objects is dropped again with
Py_XDECREF, which should be a no-op in case the paramater is NULL. Even
so, in most of these loops the variables pointing to the objects are
never set to NULL, even after Py_DECREF is called at the end of the loop
iteration. This means, after the first iteration, if an error occurs
those python objects will get their refcount dropped two times,
resulting in a possible double-free.
```

Package        : python-psutil
Version        : 2.1.1-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18874
Debian Bug     : #944605

It was discovered that there were multiple double free
vulnerabilities in python-psutil, a Python module providing
convenience functions for accessing system process data.

This was caused by incorrect reference counting handling within
for/while loops that convert system data into said Python objects.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this issue has been fixed in python-psutil
version 2.1.1-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-psutil packages.

Regards,

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
