  "CVE-2019-18679": {
    "description": "Due to incorrect data management Squid is vulnerable to a information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest Authentication.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect data management in the processing of HTTP Digest Authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer within heap memory allocation. This information can reduce ASLR protections and aid attackers in isolating memory areas for remote code execution attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing of HTTP Digest Authentication"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to trigger the processing of HTTP Digest Authentication.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists because nonce tokens contain a raw byte value of a heap memory pointer, thus reducing the effectiveness of ASLR protections."
