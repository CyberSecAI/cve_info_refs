Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-9538783033
2019-12-05 01:39:12.688383
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 4.9
Release : 2.fc31
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2019:11
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2019:11
Date: November 05, 2019
Summary: Information Disclosure issue
in HTTP Digest Authentication.
Affected versions: Squid 2.x -> 2.7.STABLE9
Squid 3.x -> 3.5.28
Squid 4.x -> 4.8
Fixed in version: Squid 4.9
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019\_11.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18679
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to incorrect data management Squid is vulnerable to a
information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest
Authentication.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer which sits
within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR
protections and may aid attackers isolating memory areas to
target for remote code execution attacks.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.9.
In addition, a patch addressing this problem for the stable
releases can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 4:
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid-2.x up to and including 2.7.STABLE9 are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 are vulnerable.
All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.8 are vulnerable.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
Either;
Remove 'auth\_param digest ...' configuration settings from
squid.conf.
Or,
Build Squid with --disable-auth-digest
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-0b16cbdd0e
2019-12-05 01:09:44.879358
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 4.9
Release : 2.fc30
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

Package        : squid3
Version        : 3.4.8-6+deb8u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12526 CVE-2019-18677 CVE-2019-18678
                 CVE-2019-18679

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by the following security
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2019-12526

     URN response handling in Squid suffers from a heap-based buffer
     overflow. When receiving data from a remote server in response to
     an URN request, Squid fails to ensure that the response can fit
     within the buffer. This leads to attacker controlled data
     overflowing in the heap.

CVE-2019-18677

     When the append_domain setting is used (because the appended
     characters do not properly interact with hostname length
     restrictions), it can inappropriately redirect traffic to origins
     it should not be delivered to. This happens because of incorrect
     message processing.

CVE-2019-18678

     A programming error allows attackers to smuggle HTTP requests
     through frontend software to a Squid instance that splits the HTTP
     Request pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages
     corrupt caches (between a client and Squid) with
     attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs. Effects are isolated
     to software between the attacker client and Squid.
     There are no effects on Squid itself, nor on any upstream servers.
     The issue is related to a request header containing whitespace
     between a header name and a colon.

CVE-2019-18679

     Due to incorrect data management, Squid is vulnerable to
     information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest Authentication.
     Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer that sits
     within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR
     protections and may aid attackers isolating memory areas to target
     for remote code execution attacks.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.4.8-6+deb8u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

1. Hash the noncedata for Digest nonces before encoding,

   to match the documentation.
2. Encode Digest nonces using hex, rather than base64.

Please avoid C-style casts in his C++ code. Also the H parameter here is an uint8\_t[] in the md5.h API.

I changed this to a `reinterpret_cast<uint8_t *>`.

The API in [md5.h](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/blob/SQUID_4_8/include/md5.h#L63) specifies `uint8_t[16]`, but in [md5.c](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/blob/SQUID_4_8/lib/md5.c#L129-L130) it's `unsigned char[16]`.

```
SQUIDCEXTERN void SquidMD5Final(uint8_t digest[16], struct SquidMD5Context *context);

```

```
void
SquidMD5Final(unsigned char digest[16], struct SquidMD5Context *ctx)

```

| I just pushed [another change](https://github.com/squidcontrib/squid/commit/5e3d96aad8709eb7b10b0de4867a77f16cc5526b) to rename identifiers: `UserRequest.nonceb64` to `UserRequest.noncehex` and `authenticateDigestNonceNonceb64` to `authenticateDigestNonceNonceHex`. I missed these earlier because I only searched for "base64", not "b64". Strangely, the [documentation comment](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/blob/SQUID_4_8/src/auth/digest/UserRequest.h#L47) for `UserRequest.nonceb64` was already a hex string. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156324#c0)  Robert Frohl   2019-11-08 15:31:51 UTC  ``` Problem Description:   Due to incorrect data management Squid is vulnerable to a  information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest  Authentication.  __________________________________________________________________  Severity:   Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer which sits  within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR  protections and may aid attackers isolating memory areas to  target for remote code execution attacks.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.9.   In addition, a patch addressing this problem for the stable  releases can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 4:  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-671ba97abe929156dc4c717ee52ad22fba0f7443.patch>>   If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:   All Squid-2.x have not been checked.

# Squid: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202003-34**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Squid, the worst of
which could lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/squid** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.10** |

### Background

Squid is a full-featured Web proxy cache designed to run on Unix
systems. It supports proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other URLs,
as well as SSL support, cache hierarchies, transparent caching, access
control lists and many other features.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by sending a specially crafted request, could
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process,
obtain sensitive information or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/squid-4.10"

```

handled certain URN requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to bypass access checks and access restricted servers. This issue was

only addressed in Ubuntu 19.04 and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-12523](/security/CVE-2019-12523))

Jeriko One discovered that Squid incorrectly handed URN responses. A remote

attacker could use this issue to cause Squid to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-12526](/security/CVE-2019-12526))

Alex Rousskov discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain strings. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Squid to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 19.04.

Debian Bug     : 950802 931478 950925 912294

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by multiple security vulnerabilities.
Due to incorrect input validation and URL request handling it was
possible to bypass access restrictions for restricted HTTP servers
and to cause a denial-of-service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.23-5+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

For the detailed security status of squid3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3>
