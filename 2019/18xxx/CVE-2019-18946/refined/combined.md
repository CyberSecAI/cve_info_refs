## General Information

Internet applications are always vulnerable to
attacks by various malicious users, abusive bots, and crawlers that can exploit
weaknesses in the data security model to gain unauthorized access to important
data.
SBM
is scanned for Web application security as part of the certification process
upon each release, and it is thoroughly tested using the following assessments
to validate the security of the enterprise data that is stored in the database.

* Cross site scripting (XSS)
* Access control weaknesses
* OS and SQL injection flaws
* Cross site request forgery (CSRF)
* Cookie manipulation
* Hidden field manipulation
* Insecure storage
* Insecure configuration

Any vulnerability that is detected during
these tests can be exploited to gain access to sensitive enterprise data and
ultimately lead to financial loss. Our development and quality assurance
organizations endeavor to expose and resolve these types of potential
vulnerabilities during each testing cycle. We take security seriously. We
strive to aggressively enhance
SBM
to safeguard against any new vulnerabilities that are discovered.

### Recommendation

The improvements described in this bulletin apply to
SBM
11.7.1.
To take advantage of these improvements and safeguard your system, consider
upgrading to version
SBM
11.7.1.

For detailed upgrade steps from earlier versions of
SBM,
refer to the
SBM
11.7.1
release notes.

## Minimum Security Configuration

Security vulnerabilities will only be
reviewed and addressed (cases accepted) after
SBM
is configured with the following:

* IIS with HTTPS enabled and HTTP disabled
* Tomcat with HTTPS enabled and HTTP disabled
* IIS and TOMCAT must use customer-supplied SSL certificates that you
  supply
* Notification Server and Mail Client must use SSL
* SSL legacy protocols are not enabled
* SSO
  URLs are all HTTPS; no HTTP entries
* Integrations must run with trusted certificates for
  SSO
* All certificates in
  SBM
  must be regenerated in
  SBM Configurator
  or use additional customer-supplied certificates
* No default certificates installed with
  SBM
  may be in use

## Recommended Security Configuration

To configure recommended security settings for SBM, perform the
following:

* Replace the default certificates that are installed with SBM by
  generating new certificates in
  SBM Configurator.
  The steps that you perform to secure
  SBM
  with new certificates depend on how
  SBM
  is installed. For details, refer to âSecuring SBMâ in the
  SBM Installation and Configuration
  Guide
  or the
  SBM Configurator
  help.
* On the
  SBM Application Engine
  server, set the
  Web Application Firewall filter level to
  **Block** on the
  Security |
  Secure SBM sub-tab in
  SBM Configurator.
* On each
  SBM
  server in your installation:
  + Change SSO keystore passwords on the
    Security |
    Secure SSO sub-tab in
    SBM Configurator.
  + Encrypt SSO configuration files on the
    Security |
    Secure SSO sub-tab in
    SBM Configurator.
  + Enable HTTP secure response headers in the
    Security |
    Secure Response Headers sub-tab in
    SBM Configurator.
    - Enable all of the options that appear.
    - Ensure that
      **anti-click jacking** is enabled. For the
      Load page in frame option, select
      **Allow from the same origin**.
  + Disable HTTP and enable HTTPS for IIS and Tomcat. Obtain valid
    certificates from a well-known Certificate Authority.
* Enable a secure password policy using the options in the
  Authentication |
  Password Restrictions sub-tab in
  SBM Configurator.
* Configure restricted and allowed files types using the
  DisallowedFileExtensions and MaxFileObjSelections options the TS\_SYSTEMSETTINGS
  table. This enables you to block or allow certain file types, as well as impose
  a restriction on the number of files that can be added to an item (the
  recommended limit is 10 files). For details, refer to
  [S143109](http://knowledgebase.serena.com/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=S143109).

## Summary

The following fixes and improvements were made in the
SBM
11.7.1
release.

* **Added FIPS 140-2 Compliance (EPIC 105170)**

  For systems that require compliance with the U.S. federal government
  security standard FIPS 140-2, you can now enable FIPS 140-2 compliance directly
  in
  SBM.
  This ensures that all encryption within SBM uses FIPS 140-2 certified
  encryption libraries and FIPS 140-2 certified algorithms.
* **Improved Encryption (EPIC 105170)**

  All encryption performed by SBM was audited and improved to use
  stronger, more secure algorithms in both FIPS and non-FIPS modes.
* **XSS on Attach URL (DEF336098)**

  Fixed a potential XSS vulnerability with the Attach URL item action.
* **XSS: Do Not Allow Opening Restricted File Attachments
  (DEF337165)**

  Fixed a potential XSS vulnerability related to attached files on
  work items.
* **Access Privileges Issue in Application Repository (DEF336103)**

  Fixed a potential security issue that enables a non-administrator to
  log in to Application Repository.
* **Session Management in Application Repository and commonsvc
  (DEF336103)**

  A new session ID is generated upon successful authentication when
  SSO is disabled.
* **Information Disclosure in Theme Import (DEF336108)**

  Removed the tempdirectory and tempdirectoryandfile parameters from
  the authentication error response when importing Work Center themes.
* **Global System Setting to Restrict Attachments (ENH338649)**

  A DBA can modify the following new entries in the TS\_SYSTEMSETTINGS
  table:
  + DisallowedFileExtensions â A comma-separated list of file
    extensions that are not valid at the system level. You can use the list to
    block or allow certain file types.
  + MaxFileObjSelections â Limits the total number of files that can
    be attached to an item via Add File or via a File Field.

  Refer to
  [S143109](http://knowledgebase.serena.com/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=S143109) for help with modifying these
  settings in the database.
* **Encryption Algorithm Used in the Application Engine Database
  (DEF337364)**

  The encryption algorithm that is used in the SBM Application Engine
  database was changed to AES256 in the following areas:

  + TS\_DBSOURCES.TS\_USERPASSWORD
  + TS\_LDAPCONFIGURATIONS.TS\_ADMP
  + TS\_MAILBOX.TS\_PASSWORD
  + TS\_WSDESCRIPTIONS.TS\_PASSWORD
  + Certain rows in TS\_SYSTEMSETTINGS, TS\_SYSTEMSETTINGSNAMESPACED
    with lower(TS\_NAME) in
    ('clientcertsslcallbackauthncertkeypassword','ldapadminpwd','mapipassword','smtpauthpassword','nsexchangepassword','mcexchangepassword')
  + Encrypted values in TSADMINCHANGES and TS\_ADMINCHANGESVALUES
  + Fields in primary and auxiliary tables that have the Password
    option checked

This release also addresses the following potential security
vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2019-18942 - Stored XSS
* CVE-2019-18943 - XML External Entity processing
* CVE-2019-18944 - Reflected XSS
* CVE-2019-18945 - Privilege escalation
* CVE-2019-18946 - Session fixation
* CVE-2019-18947 - Information disclosure

Special thanks goes to Alessio Sergi of Verizon Business (Global
