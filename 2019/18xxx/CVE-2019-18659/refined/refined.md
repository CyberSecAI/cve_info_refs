The provided content is related to CVE-2019-18659.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authentication and authorization in the 4G LTE Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system. Specifically, the system does not verify the source of alerts, allowing malicious actors to inject fake alerts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Lack of Source Authentication:** The WEA protocol doesn't authenticate the source of the alerts, making it susceptible to spoofing.
*   **Unprotected Broadcast Channel:** The broadcast channel used for delivering alerts is not protected, enabling attackers to inject arbitrary messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Spoofed Presidential Alerts:** Attackers can send fake Presidential Alerts, causing public panic and disrupting normal activities.
*   **Dissemination of Misinformation:** Attackers can use the WEA system to spread false information, potentially leading to social unrest or other harmful consequences.
*   **Public Panic:** The possibility of fake alerts, especially in crowded areas, could lead to widespread panic.
*   **Erosion of Trust:** If the public loses faith in the authenticity of emergency alerts, they might ignore genuine warnings, leading to dangerous situations.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious Base Stations:** The attack is carried out by setting up fake base stations that transmit spoofed WEA messages.
*   **Software Defined Radios (SDRs):** Commercially available SDRs can be used to perform the attack.
*   **Modified Open Source Software:** Open-source LTE software (NextEPC and srsLTE) can be modified to send the spoofed alerts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Technical Expertise:** Attackers need knowledge of 4G LTE protocols and SDR operation.
*   **Access to Hardware/Software:** They require access to commercially available software defined radios and the ability to modify open-source LTE software.
*   **Physical Proximity:** The attackers need to be within the range of the targeted cell phones to successfully inject spoofed alerts. The article mentions that a 50,000-seat stadium could be attacked with 4 malicious portable base stations with 1 Watt transmit power each.
