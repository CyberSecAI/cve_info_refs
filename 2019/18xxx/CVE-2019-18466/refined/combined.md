## Description

![@eriksjolund](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106877?v=4&size=48)[eriksjolund](https://github.com/eriksjolund)opened [on Aug 15, 2019](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/3829#issue-481310299)

**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST? (leave only one on its own line)**

/kind bug

**Description**

```
podman cp mycontainer:/testfile /tmp/test

```

may resolve a symlink in the host context (e.g. the file */tmp/hostdir/hello.txt*) and copy it into

the directory */tmp/test*

**Steps to reproduce the issue:**

```
erik@laptop:/tmp$ mkdir /tmp/hostdir
erik@laptop:/tmp$ echo hello > /tmp/hostdir/hello.txt
erik@laptop:/tmp$ cat /tmp/build.sh
container=$(buildah from scratch)
mnt=$(buildah mount $container)

touch "$mnt/file*"
ln -s "/file*" "$mnt/testfile"
ln -s "/tmp/hostdir/hello.txt" "$mnt/file_symlink_to_hostfile"

buildah umount $container
buildah commit $container glob1

erik@laptop:/tmp$ buildah unshare bash /tmp/build.sh && container=$(podman create localhost/glob1 dummycmd)

erik@laptop:/tmp$ rm -rf /tmp/test && mkdir /tmp/test && podman cp $container:/testfile /tmp/test

```

**Describe the results you received:**

```
erik@laptop:/tmp$ ls -l /tmp/test
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 erik erik 0 Aug 15 20:43 'file*'
-rw-rw-r-- 1 erik erik 6 Aug 15 20:34  hello.txt
erik@laptop:/tmp$

```

**Describe the results you expected:**

I would not have expected to see the files */tmp/test/hello.txt* and */tmp/test/file\**

**Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):**

**Output of `podman version`:**

```

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for cni, cni-plugins, conmon, fuse-overlayfs, podman
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2020:0398-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1155217 #1160460 #1164390
Cross-References: CVE-2019-18466
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 15.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for cni, cni-plugins, conmon, fuse-overlayfs, podman fixes the
following issues:
podman was updated to 1.8.0:
- CVE-2019-18466: Fixed a bug where podman cp would improperly copy files
on the host when copying a symlink in the container that included a glob
operator (#3829 bsc#1155217)
- The name of the cni-bridge in the default config changed from "cni0" to
"podman-cni0" with podman-1.6.0. Add a %trigger to rename the bridge in
the system to the new default if it exists. The trigger is only excuted
when updating podman-cni-config from something older than 1.6.0. This is
mainly needed for SLE where we're updating from 1.4.4 to 1.8.0
(bsc#1160460).
Update podman to v1.8.0 (bsc#1160460):
\* Features
- The podman system service command has been added, providing a preview
of Podman's new Docker-compatible API. This API is still very new, and
not yet ready for production use, but is available for early testing
- Rootless Podman now uses Rootlesskit for port forwarding, which should
greatly improve performance and capabilities
- The podman untag command has been added to remove tags from images
without deleting them
- The podman inspect command on images now displays previous names they
used
- The podman generate systemd command now supports a --new
option to generate service files that create and run new containers
instead of managing existing containers
- Support for --log-opt tag= to set logging tags has been added to the
journald log driver
- Added support for using Seccomp profiles embedded in images for podman
run and podman create via the new --seccomp-policy CLI flag
- The podman play kube command now honors pull policy
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the podman cp command would not copy the contents of
directories when paths ending in /. were given
- Fixed a bug where the podman play kube command did not properly locate
Seccomp profiles specified relative to localhost
- Fixed a bug where the podman info command for remote Podman did not
show registry information
- Fixed a bug where the podman exec command did not support having input
piped into it
- Fixed a bug where the podman cp command with rootless Podman
on CGroups v2 systems did not properly determine if the container
could be paused while copying
- Fixed a bug where the podman container prune --force command could
possible remove running containers if they were started while the
command was running
- Fixed a bug where Podman, when run as root, would not properly
configure slirp4netns networking when requested
- Fixed a bug where podman run --userns=keep-id did not work when the
user had a UID over 65535
- Fixed a bug where rootless podman run and podman create with the
--userns=keep-id option could change permissions on /run/user/$UID and
break KDE
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could not be run in a systemd
service on systems using CGroups v2
- Fixed a bug where podman inspect would show CPUShares as 0, instead of
the default (1024), when it was not explicitly set
- Fixed a bug where podman-remote push would segfault
- Fixed a bug where image healthchecks were not shown in the
output of podman inspect
- Fixed a bug where named volumes created with containers from pre-1.6.3
releases of Podman would be autoremoved with their containers if the
--rm flag was given, even if they were given names
- Fixed a bug where podman history was not computing image sizes
correctly
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not error on invalid values to the
--sort flag to podman images
- Fixed a bug where providing a name for the image made by podman commit
was mandatory, not optional as it should be
- Fixed a bug where the remote Podman client would append an extra " to
%PATH
- Fixed a bug where the podman build command would sometimes ignore the
-f option and build the wrong Containerfile
- Fixed a bug where the podman ps --filter command would only filter
running containers, instead of all containers, if
--all was not passed
- Fixed a bug where the podman load command on compressed images would
leave an extra copy on disk
- Fixed a bug where the podman restart command would not properly clean
up the network, causing it to function differently from podman stop;
podman start
- Fixed a bug where setting the --memory-swap flag to podman create and
podman run to -1 (to indicate unlimited) was not supported
\* Misc
- Initial work on version 2 of the Podman remote API has been merged,
but is still in an alpha state and not ready for use. Read more here
- Many formatting corrections have been made to the manpages
- The changes to address (#5009) may cause anonymous volumes created by
Podman versions 1.6.3 to 1.7.0 to not be removed when their container
is removed
- Updated vendored Buildah to v1.13.1
- Updated vendored containers/storage to v1.15.8
- Updated vendored containers/image to v5.2.0
- Add apparmor-abstractions as required runtime dependency to have
`tunables/global` available.
- fixed the --force flag for the "container prune" command.
(<https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/4844>)
Update podman to v1.7.0
\* Features
- Added support for setting a static MAC address for containers
- Added support for creating macvlan networks with podman network
create, allowing Podman containers to be attached directly to networks
the host is connected to
- The podman image prune and podman container prune commands now support
the --filter flag to filter what will be pruned, and now prompts for
confirmation when run without --force (#4410 and #4411)
- Podman now creates CGroup namespaces by default on systems using
CGroups v2 (#4363)
- Added the podman system reset command to remove all Podman files and
perform a factory reset of the Podman installation
- Added the --history flag to podman images to display previous names
used by images (#4566)
- Added the --ignore flag to podman rm and podman stop to not error when
requested containers no longer exist
- Added the --cidfile flag to podman rm and podman stop to read the IDs
of containers to be removed or stopped from a file
- The podman play kube command now honors Seccomp annotations (#3111)
- The podman play kube command now honors RunAsUser, RunAsGroup, and
selinuxOptions
- The output format of the podman version command has been changed to
better match docker version when using the
--format flag
- Rootless Podman will no longer initialize containers/storage twice,
removing a potential deadlock preventing Podman commands from running
while an image was being pulled (#4591)
- Added tmpcopyup and notmpcopyup options to the --tmpfs and
--mount type=tmpfs flags to podman create and podman run to control
whether the content of directories are copied into tmpfs filesystems
mounted over them
- Added support for disabling detaching from containers by setting empty
detach keys via --detach-keys=""
- The podman build command now supports the --pull and
--pull-never flags to control when images are pulled during a build
- The podman ps -p command now shows the name of the pod as well as its
ID (#4703)
- The podman inspect command on containers will now display the command
used to create the container
- The podman info command now displays information on registry mirrors
(#4553)
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where Podman would use an incorrect runtime directory as
root, causing state to be deleted after root logged out and making
Podman in systemd services not function properly
- Fixed a bug where the --change flag to podman import and podman commit
was not being parsed properly in many cases
- Fixed a bug where detach keys specified in libpod.conf were not used
by the podman attach and podman exec commands, which always used the
global default ctrl-p,ctrl-q key combination (#4556)
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman was not able to run podman pod stats
even on CGroups v2 enabled systems (#4634)
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would fail on kernels without the
renameat2 syscall (#4570)
- Fixed a bug where containers with chained network namespace
dependencies (IE, container A using --net container=B and container B
using --net container=C) would not properly mount /etc/hosts and
/etc/resolv.conf into the container (#4626)
- Fixed a bug where podman run with the --rm flag and without
-d could, when run in the background, throw a 'container does not
exist' error when attempting to remove the container after it exited
- Fixed a bug where named volume locks were not properly reacquired
after a reboot, potentially leading to deadlocks when trying to start
containers using the volume (#4605 and #4621)
- Fixed a bug where Podman could not completely remove containers if
sent SIGKILL during removal, leaving the container name unusable
without the podman rm --storage command to complete removal (#3906)
- Fixed a bug where checkpointing containers started with --rm was
allowed when --export was not specified (the container, and
checkpoint, would be removed after checkpointing was complete by --rm)
(#3774)
- Fixed a bug where the podman pod prune command would fail if
containers were present in the pods and the --force flag was not
passed (#4346)
- Fixed a bug where containers could not set a static IP or static MAC
address if they joined a non-default CNI network (#4500)
- Fixed a bug where podman system renumber would always throw an error
if a container was mounted when it was run
- Fixed a bug where podman container restore would fail with containers
using a user namespace
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to use the journald
events backend even on systems without systemd installed

the IDs of layers in an image (#3359)
- Fixed a bug where containers could not be restarted when Conmon v2.0.3
or later was used
- Fixed a bug where Podman did not check image OS and Architecture
against the host when starting a container
- Fixed a bug where containers in pods did not function properly with
the Kata OCI runtime (#4353)
- Fixed a bug where `podman info --format '{{ json . }}' would not
produce JSON output (#4391)
- Fixed a bug where Podman would not verify if files passed to
--authfile existed (#4328)
- Fixed a bug where podman images --digest would not always print
digests when they were available
- Fixed a bug where rootless podman run could hang due to a race with
reading and writing events
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would print warning-level logs
despite not be instructed to do so (#4456)
- Fixed a bug where podman pull would attempt to fetch from remote
registries when pulling an unqualified image using the docker-daemon
transport (#4434)
- Fixed a bug where podman cp would not work if STDIN was a pipe
- Fixed a bug where podman exec could stop accepting input if anything
was typed between the command being run and the exec session starting
(#4397)
- Fixed a bug where podman logs --tail 0 would print all lines
of a container's logs, instead of no lines (#4396)

changes to the root filesystem of the container if performed more than
once on the same container (#4606)
- Fixed a bug where containers started with --rm would not be
automatically removed on being stopped if an exec session was running
inside the container (#4666)
\* Misc
- The fixes to runtime directory path as root can cause strange behavior
if an upgrade is performed while containers are running
- Updated vendored Buildah to v1.12.0
- Updated vendored containers/storage library to v1.15.4
- Updated vendored containers/image library to v5.1.0
- Kata Containers runtimes (kata-runtime, kata-qemu, and kata-fc) are
now present in the default libpod.conf, but will not be available
unless Kata containers is installed on the system
- Podman previously did not allow the creation of containers with a
memory limit lower than 4MB. This restriction has been removed, as the
crun runtime can create containers with significantly less memory

higher
- Ensure volumes reacquire locks on system restart, preventing deadlocks
when starting containers

- Do not use the journald event logger when it is not available
Update podman to v1.6.2
\* Features
- Added a --runtime flag to podman system migrate to allow the OCI
runtime for all containers to be reset, to ease transition to the crun
runtime on CGroups V2 systems until runc gains full support
- The podman rm command can now remove containers in broken states which
previously could not be removed
- The podman info command, when run without root, now shows information
on UID and GID mappings in the rootless user namespace
- Added podman build --squash-all flag, which squashes all layers
(including those of the base image) into one layer
- The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create now accepts a
string argument and allows a new value, always, which forces systemd
support without checking if the the container entrypoint is systemd
\* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the podman top command did not work on systems using
CGroups V2 (#4192)
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could double-close a file, leading
to a panic

containers while refreshing the state
- Fixed a bug where podman start --attach --sig-proxy=false would still
proxy signals into the container

for authentication credentials (auth.json), breaking podman login
integration with skopeo and other tools using the containers/image
library

--format=json would display null when no results were returned,
instead of valid JSON
- Fixed a bug where podman build --squash was incorrectly squashing all

(#4247)
- Fixed a bug where Podman incorrectly handled some errors relating to
unmounted or missing containers in containers/storage

container ID, instead of the full ID
- Fixed a bug where containers created with an OCI runtime that is no
longer available (uninstalled or removed from the config file) would
not appear in podman ps and could not be removed via podman rm
- Fixed a bug where containers restored via podman container restore
--import would retain the CGroup path of the original container, even
if their container ID changed; thus, multiple containers created from
the same checkpoint would all share the same CGroup
\* Misc
- The default PID limit for containers is now set to 4096. It can be
adjusted back to the old default (unlimited) by passing
--pids-limit 0 to podman create and podman run
- The podman start --attach command now automatically attaches STDIN if
the container was created with -i
- The podman network create command now validates network names using
the same regular expression as container and pod names
- The --systemd flag to podman run and podman create will now
only enable systemd mode when the binary being run inside the
container is /sbin/init, /usr/sbin/init, or ends in systemd
(previously detected any path ending in init or systemd)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1744588#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-08-22 13:53:38 UTC  ``` 'podman cp' will resolve a carefully crafted symlink in host-filesystem space, yielding unexpected results when cp'ing from container to host. An attacker could create a container image containing particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may overwrite existing files with others from the host.  Upstream Issue: <https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/3829>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1744588#c6)  Qi Wang    2019-09-10 16:27:30 UTC  ``` This is a duplicate of this issue [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1741709](show_bug.cgi?id=1741709 "CLOSED EOL - podman cp resolves globs in symlinks in host-space")   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1744588#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-09-19 14:35:22 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://github.com/containers/libpod/commit/5c09c4d2947a759724f9d5aef6bac04317e03f7e>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1744588#c9)  Sam Fowler    2019-09-23 02:48:49 UTC  ``` Created podman tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1754354](show_bug.cgi?id=1754354 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-18466 podman: resolving symlink in host filesystem leads to unexpected results of copy operation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1744588#c13)  Daniel Walsh    2019-10-16 20:23:17 UTC  ``` Matt, Ed, Brent, Jhon do we have a fix for this?   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1744588#c14)  Ed Santiago    2019-10-16 20:32:19 UTC  ``` #3829 is closed, and I've added regression tests, so I think this is resolved.

This issue did not affect the versions of podman as shipped in OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 and 4.1 as they did not include support for the copy function.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1155217#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-10-28 16:03:11 UTC  ``` via rh bug  'podman cp' will resolve a carefully crafted symlink in host-filesystem space, yielding unexpected results when cp'ing from container to host. An attacker could create a container image containing particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may overwrite existing files with others from the host.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# CVE-2019-18466

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-18463.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-18601.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-18466 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18466)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Podman in libpod before 1.6.0. It resolves a symlink in the host context during a copy operation from the container to the host, because an undesired glob operation occurs. An attacker could create a container image containing particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may overwrite existing files with others from the host.
