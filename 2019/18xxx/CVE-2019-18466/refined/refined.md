Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18466:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from `lists.opensuse.org`, `access.redhat.com` and `bugzilla.suse.com` directly mentions CVE-2019-18466, confirming its relevance. Additionally, the github content from the podman repository references the fix for the issue reported as CVE-2019-18466.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause lies in how `podman cp` handles symlinks during copy operations from a container to the host filesystem. Specifically, `podman cp` incorrectly resolves symlinks in the host context, which leads to copying the target of the symlink from the host instead of from the container. Also, before the fix a glob operation was performed which resulted in an attack vector.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Symlink Dereference:** The core vulnerability is the uncontrolled dereferencing of symlinks within the host file system during a container-to-host copy operation. This means the copy operation is happening from host instead of the container.
   - **Unintended Glob Expansion:** The use of `filepath.Glob`  on the source path, also leads to unintended consequences if the symlink target includes glob operators.
   
**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **File Overwrite/Modification:** A malicious container image can contain specifically crafted symlinks that, when copied to the host by a user with `podman cp`, can overwrite existing host files, allowing for unintended data modification/overwriting, leading to a potential compromise or denial of service. This vulnerability is a file overwrite issue.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Malicious Container Image:** An attacker crafts a container image with a specific symlink.
   - **Podman cp:** A victim user attempts to copy a file from the malicious container using the `podman cp` command to a location on the host system.
  
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

    - The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malicious container image.
    - The attacker needs to convince a victim user to use `podman cp` to copy a symlink from their malicious container to their host filesystem. The user must have the ability to run the podman cp command, and access the crafted container image.

**Additional Details (beyond official CVE description):**

-   The openSUSE and Red Hat content details the fixes and updates made to podman and related components to address this vulnerability in their respective distributions.
-   The Red Hat advisory also mentions that the initial versions of podman shipped with their distribution did not have copy capabilities, which means those versions were not affected by this CVE.
-   The fix includes removing the glob on host side and only dereference symlinks in the container.

In summary, CVE-2019-18466 exposes a vulnerability where `podman cp` can be tricked into copying host-based files due to improper symlink handling. The attack is initiated by a malicious container image with crafted symlinks, impacting users copying files from the container to the host and could result in an overwrite of the users local files.
