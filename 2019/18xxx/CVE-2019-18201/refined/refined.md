Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-18201

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Fujitsu Wireless Keyboard Set LX390 transmits data packets containing keyboard events (keystrokes) without encryption. Although the data is encoded using data whitening/scrambling, the mechanism and its configuration can be identified through analysis of the radio communication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of encryption for the wireless communication between the keyboard and the USB receiver, making it susceptible to eavesdropping.
*   **Data Whitening/Scrambling Weakness:** While data whitening is present, it is insufficient to prevent analysis and decoding of the communication. The mechanism and configuration are discoverable by analyzing the radio communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Eavesdropping:** An attacker can remotely eavesdrop on the wireless communication and decode the transmitted keystrokes in cleartext.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as passwords, login credentials, and other personal data entered via the keyboard.
*   **Keystroke Injection:** While not directly part of CVE-2019-18201, the advisory mentions that knowledge gained from analyzing this vulnerability also allows for keystroke injection attacks, as described in SYSS-2019-011 (CVE-2019-18200). This enables an attacker to remotely send arbitrary keystrokes to the computer system connected to the vulnerable keyboard set, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Wireless Sniffing:** The attacker can use a software-defined radio and appropriate software tools to sniff and intercept the wireless communication between the keyboard and the USB receiver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within the radio range of the wireless keyboard set.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of radio communication protocols, the data whitening/scrambling method used by the device, and the ability to analyze the captured radio signals to extract the keystroke data.
*   **Equipment:** The attacker requires specialized hardware and software such as a software-defined radio (SDR) or a USB radio dongle, along with appropriate software tools for capturing, analyzing, and decoding the radio communication.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by SySS GmbH.
*   The affected product, Fujitsu Wireless Keyboard Set LX390 (Model No. GK381) has reached its end-of-life (EOL) in May 2019.
*   Fujitsu has released successor models (LX410 and LX960) that are not affected by this issue.

**Mitigation:**
The advisory recommends replacing the vulnerable Fujitsu Wireless Keyboard Set LX390 with a newer, more secure model, such as the LX410 or LX960.
