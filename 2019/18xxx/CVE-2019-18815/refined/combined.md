Hi, [@abdilahrf](https://github.com/abdilahrf) and I found open redirection vulnerability on the PopojiCMS. The vulnerable code is on **index.php** file line number **101**

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c6bc98f78cdc91cd14d14b97feb274476e06a9bca35f8a12b50aa14cd39b3024/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f3652724d4367552e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c6bc98f78cdc91cd14d14b97feb274476e06a9bca35f8a12b50aa14cd39b3024/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f3652724d4367552e706e67)

notice the parameter refer was used by the code to redirect the user's to another page. So by crafting a request that using the POST method and contains the refer parameter, we could control where to redirect the user.
