CVE-2019-18802
```

The provided content describes CVE-2019-18802, a vulnerability in Envoy versions 1.12.1 and earlier.

- **Root Cause:** The HTTP/1.x codec in Envoy fails to trim whitespace after header values.
- **Vulnerability:** Failure to trim whitespace after header values in HTTP/1.x headers. Specifically, request header with trailing whitespace may cause route matchers or access controls to be bypassed.
- **Impact:** An untrusted remote client can send HTTP headers with trailing whitespace (e.g., "Host: example.com ") that bypass route matchers or access controls. This can lead to:
  - Escalation of privileges
  - Information disclosure
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a header containing trailing whitespace after the header value.
- **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker is an untrusted remote client capable of sending HTTP requests.
- **Mitigation:** Disable upstream HTTP/1 or upgrade to Envoy version 1.12.2 or later.
