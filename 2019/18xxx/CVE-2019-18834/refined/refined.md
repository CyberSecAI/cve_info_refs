Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-18834

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a result of two primary issues:
1. **Insufficient Input Filtering:** The client-side input fields within the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin were not employing a recursive filter, which allowed for the circumvention of the initial sanitization by using multiple sets of angled brackets. For example, a payload like `"><img src=a o<>nerror=alert(9)>` would bypass the filter, which only removed the first instance of `<>` resulting in `"><img src=a onerror=alert(9)>`.
2. **Improper Output Encoding:** The application failed to properly encode the user-supplied data when displaying it within the WordPress admin panel. Specifically, characters such as quotes were not encoded in the admin panel which allowed for the execution of the injected javascript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This vulnerability allows for the storage of malicious scripts within the application's database. These stored scripts can be triggered later, affecting users who access the vulnerable parts of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker can potentially capture session tokens or keystrokes of administrators, leading to account takeover.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful XSS attacks in the admin panel can lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the WordPress site.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated User Input:** The attack vector is through a client-facing interface of the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin, where an unauthenticated user can input customer details.
- **Stored XSS Payload:** The malicious script is stored in the application database, allowing it to be executed when an administrator accesses the affected area within the admin panel.
- **Admin Panel Trigger:** The XSS payload is triggered when an admin user views subscription details in the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site to inject the malicious code.
- **Basic Input Injection Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft XSS payloads and bypass basic input filters.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to identify the presence of the vulnerable plugin in order to utilize this attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability existed in WooCommerce Subscriptions versions prior to 2.6.3 and was patched in version 2.6.3.
- The vulnerability was present in the client billing information section.
- The described attack vector uses the mouseover function of a subscription text in the admin panel to trigger the XSS.
