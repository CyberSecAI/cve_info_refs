**Vulnerability:** CVE-2019-18335

**Affected Product:** SPPA-T3000 Application Server (all versions prior to Service Pack R8.2 SP2)

**Root Cause:**  The vulnerability arises from the Application Server exposing access to logs and configuration files through port 80/tcp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the Application Server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that there was no known public exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of publication.
