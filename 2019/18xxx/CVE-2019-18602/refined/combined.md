OpenAFS Security Advisory 2019-002
Topic: information leakage from uninitialized scalars
Issued: 22 October, 2019
Affected: OpenAFS versions 1.0 through 1.6.23, and 1.8.0 through 1.8.4
Generated RPC handler routines only initialized local variables that would
need to be freed, leaving uninitialized memory contents in RPC
parameters of scalar type. When combined with RPC implementations that
also did not supply output values, this results in the contents of
uninitialized memory being sent to the peer, even for successful RPCs.
SUMMARY
=======
AFS-3 RPCs use the XDR data encoding to represent input/output arguments,
and OpenAFS uses an XDR en/decoder that is tightly integrated to the Rx
protocol implementation. The generated RPC handler code takes care of
allocating storage/variables for the input/output variables and reading the
input parameters from the network into local storage before calling the
function that implements the RPC logic. Similarly, after that function
call, the generated code takes care of encoding the output parameters into
Rx packets and sending them to the peer as necessary, then deallocating the
storage it allocated and returning control flow to the caller. While
the generated code is careful to initialize the local variables that
might contain pointers to allocated memory (to ensure leak-free
operation), scalar values (e.g., integers, flat structures) were not
initialized. Some RPC handlers in OpenAFS do not always write to all output
variables, even in the case of a successful return, so the contents of these
uninitialized variables would be encoded into the XDR stream and sent to the
(potentially unauthenticated) peer.
IMPACT
======
It is uncommon for the server-side implementation of an RPC to not write
to its output variables on the success case, though multiple occurrences
have been found during an incomplete survey, leaking between 4 and 8 bytes
per call. However, the actual amount and rate of data exposure is highly
context-dependent, since the memory allocator behavior and other load on the
system affect exactly what information is leaked from uninitialized memory.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.24 are affected, as are OpenAFS
1.8.0 through 1.8.4.
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade all machines
to the 1.8.5 or 1.6.24 releases. It is necessary to restart the server
processes and cache manager in order for the fixes to take effect.
DETAILS
=======
The AFS-3 protocol suite and OpenAFS extensions are run over the Rx RPC
protocol. A variant of Sun rpcgen, rxgen, is used to generate data
en/decoding routines and client- and server-side stub functions from an
interface description file. In the RPC server, these stubs interface
between the Rx network protocol layer and the implementation of the RPC
server-side logic. The server logic is written as a normal C function,
taking input variables either as pointer-to-struct or scalar-by-value, and
returning output variables via pointer arguments (allocating storage as
appropriate). The generated stub allocates storage on the stack for local
variables to hold the input and ouput arguments of the RPC that are passed
as arguments to the function implementing the server logic, but (as is
common in code of this vintage) only initializes some of the variables
to known values. In particular, only the variables that will need to be
passed to memory deallocation routines at the end of the function are
initialized, to ensure that a garbage pointer is not passed to free().
That leaves scalar types (integers, flat structures, etc.) with no
explicit initialization, so references to them retrieve whatever
happened to previously occupy that location in the program's address
space.
If an RPC implementation does not write to all its output variables (for
example, if they correspond to some functionality that was not requested
by the client or is disabled by configuration), then program execution
will reach the end of the generated stub function without any value
having been explicitly assigned to these (scalar) variables. In
particular, these uninitialized values are passed to the XDR encoder
routine and (as is common in code of this vintage) only initializes
some of the variables to known values. In particular, only the
variables that will need to be passed to memory deallocation routines at
the end of the function are initialized, to ensure that a garbage
pointer is not passed to free(). That leaves scalar types (integers,
flat structures, etc.) with no explicit initialization, so references to
them retrieve whatever happened to previously occupy that location in
the program's address space. This includes when these variables are
passed to the XDR encoder, so the uninitialized memory contents are
encoded into the Rx stream and sent to the peer.
Investigations surrounding this issue uncovered multiple RPCs known to leave
output parameters uninitialized while returning success. However, since the
risk is systemic and best addressed with a systemic fix, no effort was made
to perform a comprehensive search and enumerate the RPCs with the flaw.
As with most avenues for information disclosure from uninitialized
memory, vulnerabilities of this nature can be difficult to exploit, as
there is not always context for \*which\* content from uninitialized
memory is leaked to the caller, and that is in turn dependent on the
allocation/deallocation patterns in the surrounding application and the
other load patterns on the server. However, there are worked examples
in other software of attackers being able to massage allocator state and
stack contents in order to exfiltrate specific information, so it should
be assumed that such attacks are also possible here given a sufficiently
dedicated attacker.

Package        : openafs
Version        : 1.6.9-2+deb8u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18601 CVE-2019-18602 CVE-2019-18603
Debian Bug     : 943587

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenAFS, a
distributed file system.

CVE-2019-18601

    OpenAFS is prone to denial of service from unserialized data access
    because remote attackers can make a series of VOTE_Debug RPC calls
    to crash a database server within the SVOTE_Debug RPC handler.

CVE-2019-18602

    OpenAFS is prone to an information disclosure vulnerability because
    uninitialized scalars are sent over the network to a peer.

CVE-2019-18603

    OpenAFS is prone to information leakage upon certain error
    conditions because uninitialized RPC output variables are sent over
    the network to a peer.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.6.9-2+deb8u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
