OpenAFS Security Advisory 2019-001
Topic: information leakage from uninitialized RPC output variables on error
Issued: 22 October, 2019
Affected: OpenAFS versions 1.0 through 1.6.23, and 1.8.0 through 1.8.4
Generated RPC handler routines ran output variables through XDR encoding
even when the call had failed and would shortly be aborted (and for
which uninitialized output variables is common); any complete packets
assembled in the process would be sent to the peer, leaking the contents
of the uninitialized memory in question.
SUMMARY
=======
AFS-3 RPCs use the XDR data encoding to represent input/output arguments,
and OpenAFS uses an XDR en/decoder that is tightly integrated to the Rx
protocol implementation. The generated RPC handler code takes care of
allocating storage/variables for the input/output variables and reading the
input parameters from the network into local storage before calling the
function that implements the RPC logic. Similarly, after that function
call, the generated code takes care of encoding the output parameters into
Rx packets and sending them to the peer as necessary, then deallocating the
storage it allocated and returning control flow to the caller. However, in
the case of an error return from the handler, the Rx layer will abort the
current Rx call to direct the peer that the operation failed, and
well-behaved peers will discard any information obtained as part of the
aborted call. Unfortunately, the generated code was going through the
"encode output parameters" step even when the resulting data would not be of
use to well-behaved peers, and in some cases the output parameters remained
uninitialized in the case of error returns (on the assumption that since it
was an error, the call would be aborted). So for non-well-behaved peers, a
large partially constructed response could include information from
uninitialized memory in the RPC handler.
IMPACT
======
RPCs that produce large responses are most at risk, and configurations that
use small MTU values, since those increate the likelihood of one or more
complete Rx packets being filled. Leaving output variables uninitialized on
error returns is a fairly common phenomenon, so many RPCs are expected to be
at risk. The amount and rate of data exposure is highly context-dependent,
since the memory allocator behavior and other load on the system affect
exactly what information is leaked from uninitialized memory.
At present, no code paths in the cache manager are known to trigger this
issue, but the risk has not been conclusively shown to be absent, so clients
are listed as potentially affected as well.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.24 are affected, as are OpenAFS
1.8.0 through 1.8.4.
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade all machines
to the 1.8.5 or 1.6.24 releases. It is necessary to restart the server
processes and cache manager in order for the fixes to take effect.
DETAILS
=======
The AFS-3 protocol suite and OpenAFS extensions are run over the Rx RPC
protocol. A variant of Sun rpcgen, rxgen, is used to generate data
en/decoding routines and client- and server-side stub functions from an
interface description file. In the RPC server, these stubs interface
between the Rx network protocol layer and the implementation of the RPC
server-side logic. The server logic is written as a normal C function,
taking input variables either as pointer-to-struct or scalar-by-value, and
returning output variables via pointer arguments (allocating storage as
appropriate). The generated stub allocates storage on the stack for local
variables to hold the input and ouput arguments of the RPC that are passed
as arguments to the function implementing the server logic, and as discussed
in OPENAFS-SA-2019-002, these local variables are only sometimes given an
initial value; at other times they remain uninitialized and potentially
refer to other content in the memory address space of the running process.
Once the function implementing the server logic returns to the generated
stub, the stub function uses the XDR encoder to pack the output variables
from the local variables into an XDR bytestream. The way in which the
OpenAFS encoder works results in Rx packets being generated by the XDR
encoder, and when a complete packet is assembled, it is sent to the peer
according to the Rx congestion-control logic. After all the output
parameters have been encoded to the XDR bytestream, the generated stub frees
any storage allocated, and then returns the result from the server logic.
On success, this translates to completing any partially constructed Rx
packet and sending the response code, but for error returns, any pending
data is discarded and instead an Rx abort packet is sent for the Rx call
over which the RPC is running. The abort indicates to the client that the
RPC has failed and the XDR stream is to be discarded.
Unfortunately, the XDR-encode-and-send-packets step is not skipped in the
case of error returns, even though the call will ultimately be aborted and
well-behaved clients will discard the XDR bytestream, there is still an
opportunity for Rx packets to be generated and sent. When combined with the
potential for uninitialized local variables to be included in the encoded
stream, this results in a channel for the contents of uninitialized memory
to be sent on the wire to a (potentially unauthenticated) peer.
Vulnerabilities of this nature can be difficult to exploit, as there is not
always context for \*which\* content from uninitialized memory is leaked to
the caller, and that is in turn dependent on the allocation/deallocation
patterns in the surrounding application and the other load patterns on the
server. However, there are worked examples in other software of attackers
being able to massage allocator state and stack contents in order to
exfiltrate specific information, so it should be assumed that such attacks
are also possible here given a sufficiently dedicated attacker.

Package        : openafs
Version        : 1.6.9-2+deb8u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18601 CVE-2019-18602 CVE-2019-18603
Debian Bug     : 943587

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenAFS, a
distributed file system.

CVE-2019-18601

    OpenAFS is prone to denial of service from unserialized data access
    because remote attackers can make a series of VOTE_Debug RPC calls
    to crash a database server within the SVOTE_Debug RPC handler.

CVE-2019-18602

    OpenAFS is prone to an information disclosure vulnerability because
    uninitialized scalars are sent over the network to a peer.

CVE-2019-18603

    OpenAFS is prone to information leakage upon certain error
    conditions because uninitialized RPC output variables are sent over
    the network to a peer.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.6.9-2+deb8u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
