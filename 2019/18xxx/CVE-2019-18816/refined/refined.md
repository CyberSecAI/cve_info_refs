Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when handling user-provided data in the "Post" feature of PopojiCMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the system via a crafted request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. This means the injected malicious script is permanently stored on the server and executed when other users view the affected content (posts).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information visible within the user's browser context.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the content of the viewed page, potentially redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to sites that attempt to install malware.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker intercepts the HTTP request made to the server when creating or editing a post.
*   **Payload Injection:** Within the intercepted request body, the attacker injects a malicious XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the request made to the server to modify its content. This can be done using a proxy tool or a browser plugin.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP requests and XSS:** The attacker needs to be familiar with manipulating request bodies and crafting a working XSS payload.
*   **Access to create/edit posts:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit posts on the targeted PopojiCMS instance.
