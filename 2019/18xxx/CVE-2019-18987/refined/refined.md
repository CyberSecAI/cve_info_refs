Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the AbuseFilter extension not properly validating the filter ID against the history item ID when viewing historical versions of abuse filters. Specifically, the system was using the filter ID from the URL path to retrieve history, instead of validating that it belonged to the correct filter. This allowed an attacker to view past public versions of private filters by manipulating the filter ID parameter in the URL while still specifying the correct history ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate input validation: The system didn't verify if the filter ID in the URL matched the filter associated with the provided history ID.
- Information disclosure: Public versions of private filters could be viewed by users who should not have had access to them.
- Redundant URL parameter: The filter ID parameter in the URL is redundant, complicating the code and contributing to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized viewing of private filters: Attackers could access the filter patterns, actions, and other configurations of private filters, which could contain sensitive information about abuse prevention strategies.
- Undermining security mechanisms: Exposing the logic of private filters can allow malicious users to circumvent them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Manipulated URL: The attacker crafts a URL with a valid history ID of a public filter version but substitutes the filter ID in the URL path with another. For example:
  - Normal URL for private filter 1008, version 22545: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history/1008/item/22545` (returns an error as expected).
  - Manipulated URL to view version 22545 of filter 1008: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history/1/item/22545`. The filter ID `1` is bogus and used to bypass access control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Basic understanding of URL structure.
- Knowledge of a public filter's history ID that has at one point been public (even if temporarily).
- No special user privileges are required. Any user (including anonymous users) can exploit this.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The issue was quickly discovered by a user and reported, which shows good responsiveness to security issues.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure the filter ID matches the history item ID.
- The fix is a temporary stopgap, as there are plans to remove the redundant filter ID parameter in the URL in the future.
- The fix was deployed across multiple branches of the AbuseFilter extension, highlighting the widespread nature of the vulnerability.
- The patch includes a `@fixme` comment to remind developers to address the underlying issue of the redundant parameter in the future.
