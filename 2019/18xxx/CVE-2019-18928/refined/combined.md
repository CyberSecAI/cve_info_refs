But how do you "use" this package besides compiling things against it?  A common convention is that there's only the -devel subpackage if there's only headers and a static lib to ship.  libassuan is one example, libmatroska and libebml were before they got shared libs, and I'm sure there are others examples in the repo.  IMO it's not confusing at all, but the right thing to do.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=177270#c4)  Christian Iseli    2006-03-16 15:00:32 UTC  ``` What's the status of this package ?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c0)  Upstream Release Monitoring    2019-11-14 23:37:14 UTC  ``` Latest upstream release: 3.0.12 Current version/release in rawhide: 3.0.11-1.fc31 URL: <https://www.cyrusimap.org/>  Please consult the package updates policy before you issue an update to a stable branch: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Updates_Policy>   More information about the service that created this bug can be found at: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Upstream_release_monitoring>   Please keep in mind that with any upstream change, there may also be packaging changes that need to be made. Specifically, please remember that it is your responsibility to review the new version to ensure that the licensing is still correct and that no non-free or legally problematic items have been added upstream.   Based on the information from anitya: <https://release-monitoring.org/project/9643/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c1)  Jason Tibbitts    2019-11-22 20:32:30 UTC  ``` The update should be trivial, but for some reason all of the imaptest-related tests are failing with:  =====> Cyrus::ImapTest[171] /builddir/build/BUILD/cyrus-imapd-3.0.12/cassandane-c8040fd9e3a3c9ec96a7b58ff8a0601756108d46/imaptest/src/imaptest: symbol lookup error: /builddir/build/BUILD/cyrus-imapd-3.0.12/cassandane-c8040fd9e3a3c9ec96a7b58ff8a0601756108d46/imaptest/src/imaptest: undefined symbol: base64_encode  I haven't had a chance to dig into what has broken.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c2)  Pavel Zhukov    2019-11-23 22:08:26 UTC  ``` Imaptest is broken again because of dovecot rebase without soname bump.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c3)  Jason Tibbitts    2019-11-25 18:44:28 UTC  ``` A simple rebuild fixes imaptest; hopefully that will get done soon.  I will go ahead and push the fix to F31 and F30, since the build problem is not seen there.  I will try to remember to kick off a rawhide build once imaptest is fixed.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-11-25 21:14:44 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-393e1cef4d has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-393e1cef4d>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-11-25 21:14:45 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-03be160f9c has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-03be160f9c>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c6)  Pavel Zhukov    2019-11-26 05:20:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jason Tibbitts from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c3)) > A simple rebuild fixes imaptest; hopefully that will get done soon. >  Right. But the problem came from dovecot. Dovecot doesn't maintain any so versioning and simply breaks imaptest (and cyrus-imapd tests) without any notifications and it's long endless story [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1644715](show_bug.cgi?id=1644715 "CLOSED EOL - libdovecot doesn't export str_escape anymore") This behavior violates <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#_downstream_so_name_versioning> at least.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c7)  Jason Tibbitts    2019-11-26 17:03:22 UTC  ``` Certainly the dovecot behavior is terrible; you'll get no argument from me on that point.  But a rebuild of imaptest is trivial and is the quickest path to getting an updated Cyrus package out.  In any case, it's done now and 3.0.12 has been built in rawhide as well.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c8)  Pavel Zhukov    2019-11-26 17:17:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jason Tibbitts from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c7)) > Certainly the dovecot behavior is terrible; you'll get no argument from me > on that point.

Thank you, Jason!   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c9)  Fedora Update System    2019-11-27 00:32:16 UTC  ``` cyrus-imapd-3.0.12-1.fc31 has been pushed to the Fedora 31 testing repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report. See [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for instructions on how to install test updates. You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-03be160f9c>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c10)  Fedora Update System    2019-11-27 01:07:37 UTC  ``` cyrus-imapd-3.0.12-1.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.

Fedora 29 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c12)  Ben Cotton    2019-11-27 16:37:02 UTC  ``` This bug was accidentally closed due to a query error. Reopening.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c13)  Fedora Update System    2019-12-05 01:11:01 UTC  ``` cyrus-imapd-3.0.12-1.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1772708#c14)  Fedora Update System    2019-12-05 01:40:04 UTC  ``` cyrus-imapd-3.0.12-1.fc31 has been pushed to the Fedora 31 stable repository.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-03be160f9c
2019-12-05 01:39:12.688869
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : cyrus-imapd
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 3.0.12
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.cyrusimap.org/>
Summary : A high-performance email, contacts and calendar server
Description :
The Cyrus IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server provides access to
personal mail, system-wide bulletin boards, news-feeds, calendar and contacts
through the IMAP, JMAP, NNTP, CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. The Cyrus IMAP
server is a scalable enterprise groupware system designed for use from small to
large enterprise environments using technologies based on well-established Open
Standards.

A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board
environment to be set up across one or more nodes. It differs from other IMAP
server implementations in that it is run on sealed nodes, where users are not
normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the
filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail
is through software using the IMAP, IMAPS, JMAP, POP3, POP3S, KPOP, CalDAV
and/or CardDAV protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the Cyrus IMAP server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.

A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board
environment to be set up across one or more nodes. It differs from other IMAP
server implementations in that it is run on sealed nodes, where users are not
normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the
filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail
is through software using the IMAP, IMAPS, JMAP, POP3, POP3S, KPOP, CalDAV
and/or CardDAV protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the Cyrus IMAP server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3052-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : cyrus-imapd
Version        : 2.5.10-3+deb9u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18928 CVE-2021-33582
Debian Bug     : 993433

It was discovered that the Cyrus IMAP server was prone to a denial of service
attack via input that is mishandled during hash-table interaction. Furthermore
it allowed privilege escalation because an HTTP request may be interpreted in
the authentication context of an unrelated previous request that arrived over
the same connection.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.5.10-3+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd packages.

For the detailed security status of cyrus-imapd please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cyrus-imapd>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
