Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-18285:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The RMI (Remote Method Invocation) communication between the client and the Application Server in Siemens SPPA-T3000 is unencrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319). The lack of encryption exposes sensitive data transmitted over the network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the communication channel can read the credentials of a valid user. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- This vulnerability only allows for the reading of credentials, not modification.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. The attacker needs to have access to the Application Highway where the RMI communication takes place.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the Application Highway in order to intercept and read the unencrypted RMI traffic.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
