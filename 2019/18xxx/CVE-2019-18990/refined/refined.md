The provided content is related to CVE-2019-18990.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that access points using vulnerable chipsets do not properly validate the source of received packets. Specifically, the access point accepts and routes unencrypted packets sent from a spoofed MAC address, as long as there is another properly authenticated client connected to the WPA2 network.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass: An attacker can inject packets into a WPA2-protected network without knowing the preshared key.
- Lack of proper packet validation: The access point does not drop plain-text packets originating from a spoofed MAC address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can send arbitrary packets through the network as if they were valid, and they receive encrypted responses.
- An attacker can determine if injected packets reach an active system, even if the responses are encrypted.
- An attacker can open UDP ports in the routerâ€™s NAT, enabling communication with the vulnerable network via the opened port.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be in physical proximity to the vulnerable network to send packets.
- The attacker sends unencrypted packets with a spoofed MAC address.
- A properly authenticated client must be connected to the WPA2 network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within range of the vulnerable access point.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and send network packets with spoofed MAC addresses.
- The attacker needs another authenticated client to be connected to the network.
