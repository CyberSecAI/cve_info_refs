The provided content describes multiple crashes in EximiousSoft Logo Designer 3.82, discovered through fuzzing. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in improper handling of data within the application when processing specially crafted `.eld` files. These files trigger memory corruption and access violations during various operations like rendering text, applying shadows, handling gradients, and processing vector shapes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Write Access Violation (Case #01):** An out-of-bounds write occurs in `ExiVectorRender!StrokeText_Blend`, attempting to write to an invalid memory address.
2.  **Heap Corruption (Case #02):**  A heap corruption is detected, leading to a crash within `ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey`. This suggests a memory management issue, likely a double free or use-after-free.
3.  **Write Access Violation (Case #03):** An out-of-bounds write occurs within `ExiCustomPathLib!ExiCustomPathLib::CGradientColorsProfile::BuildGradientColorsTable`, trying to write to an invalid memory address.
4.  **Heap Corruption (Case #04):**  Another heap corruption, similar to Case #02, is detected within `ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey`, indicating another memory management issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The immediate impact is the crashing of EximiousSoft Logo Designer.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The identified vulnerabilities, particularly the user mode write access violations and heap corruptions, are classified as "EXPLOITABLE" by the `!exploitable` debugger plugin. This means they could potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution by a skilled attacker, allowing them to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Parsing:** The attack vector involves opening a specially crafted `.eld` file in EximiousSoft Logo Designer. The vulnerable code is triggered during the file parsing and rendering process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create or obtain a malicious `.eld` file designed to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable application. This could be through social engineering or by embedding the file in a place where the user will likely encounter it.

**Additional Details**
* The analysis was performed using a Windows debugger (WinDbg) and the !exploitable plugin.
* The fuzzer used generated over 22,000 test cases.
