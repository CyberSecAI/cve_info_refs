| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1186226#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2021-05-19 06:34:55 UTC  ``` Identified by Malte Kraus.  Cryptctl hashes and salts passwords, so it's clear that it tries to follow best practices.   Unfortunately I hashes the password on the client side (with keyserv.HashPassword). That means that if a hash is leaked then the hash can just be used directly and doesn't need to be cracked. The password needs to be transferred over an encrypted transport and be hashed on the server. With that a leaked hash can't be directly reused but must be cracked.  While we're at it we should replace the single round of SHA512 with bcrypt or similar. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1186226#c7)  Peter Varkoly   2021-06-14 20:26:27 UTC  ``` The client should authenticate with plain text password instead of the salted password hash. For compatibility reason the server can handle authentication with hashed passwords too if this is allowed by the sysconfig variable ALLOW_HASH_AUTH. Supported update: Step 1. Update the server Step 2. Set ALLOW_HASH_AUTH to yes if the update of the Clients can take a long time and some password authentication issue can happend. Step 3. Update the clients Step 4. Set ALLOW_HASH_AUTH to no.  More informations in <https://github.com/SUSE/cryptctl/pull/2> ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1186226#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2021-06-23 16:17:31 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2021:2137-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
