The provided content is related to CVE-2019-18906.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cryptctl` client-side application hashes passwords before sending them to the server. This client-side hashing makes a leaked hash directly usable without requiring cracking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Client-side password hashing: The client hashes passwords using `keyserv.HashPassword` before sending them to the server.
- Single round of SHA512: The hashing algorithm used is a single round of SHA512, which is considered weak compared to bcrypt or similar algorithms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Leaked hashes can be directly reused without needing to be cracked.
- An attacker gaining access to leaked password hashes can directly use them for authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Leaking or obtaining the hashed password from the client side.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the leaked password hashes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves changing the client to send plain text passwords and the server to handle authentication with both plain text and hashed passwords. The server uses a `ALLOW_HASH_AUTH` sysconfig variable to allow hashed passwords for compatibility reasons during the update process.
- The password should be transferred over an encrypted transport.
- The fix also mentions replacing the single round of SHA512 with a stronger algorithm like bcrypt.
