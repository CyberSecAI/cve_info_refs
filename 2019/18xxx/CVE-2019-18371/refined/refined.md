  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Misconfigured NGINX alias allows directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal vulnerability",
    "Bypass authentication"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the device by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, and bypass authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted request to download an arbitrary file with directory traversal characters such as `../`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the target device."
