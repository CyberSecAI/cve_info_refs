Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `mini_httpd` web server on D-Link DAP-1360 devices contains an undocumented function `start_telnet` that can be triggered via an HTTP request to `/start_telnet`.
*   This function starts the `telnetd` daemon on the device, regardless of any access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unauthenticated Command Bypass:** The `start_telnet` function can be called without any authentication, allowing unauthorized users to enable the telnet service.
2.  **Weak Default Root Credentials (Older Firmware):** Firmware versions up to and including 6.12b01 have weak, hardcoded root passwords, which are vulnerable to brute-force attacks. While the root password was changed from 6.12b01 to 6.12b03, the telnet service could still be started without authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Root Access:** An attacker can enable the telnet service using the unauthenticated HTTP request.
*   **Full System Control:** With the telnet service enabled and the weak default root password (on older firmware), an attacker can gain a root shell on the device, enabling full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the device's web server with `/start_telnet` in the URL (e.g., `http://<device_ip>/start_telnet`).
*   **Telnet Access:** Once the telnet service is enabled, the attacker can connect using the weak default root password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's port 80 (HTTP).
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication or knowledge of the devices password.
*   **Exploitation of Default Credentials (Older Firmwares):** If the firmware version is older than 6.12b03, the attacker needs to be able to use/brute force the weak root password.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located within the `mini_httpd.c` file of the device's firmware. The `start_telnet` function manipulates `/etc/inetd.conf`, kills the original `inetd` and restarts it, ultimately starting the telnet daemon.
*   The vulnerability affects D-Link DAP-1360 hardware revision F devices with firmware versions from 6.09EU to 6.13EUbeta and older.
*   A fix has been released in firmware version 6.14EUb01BETA.
