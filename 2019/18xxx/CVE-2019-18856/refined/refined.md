Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE-2019-18856?**

The provided content is a commit message related to a Drupal project called "svg_sanitizer". It references issue #3064351 which states, "Pin composer.json to prevent installation of insecure versions of enshrined/svg-sanitize." This suggests that the commit is related to a security issue related to the `enshrined/svg-sanitize` library.

While the CVE description is not available, the commit message indicates that the purpose is to prevent the installation of vulnerable versions of a dependency, which is a common practice for addressing security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, it is likely that this commit is related to CVE-2019-18856, but more information is needed from the official CVE entry to confirm this. This content suggests the vulnerability lies within `enshrined/svg-sanitize`, not directly in the Drupal project, but that the Drupal project uses this library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause appears to be the usage of an insecure version of the `enshrined/svg-sanitize` library within the Drupal project. The commit aims to lock the dependency version in the `composer.json` file to prevent installation of known vulnerable versions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The vulnerability is that the `svg_sanitizer` Drupal project's dependency, `enshrined/svg-sanitize`, was not locked to a specific version, allowing for the possibility of insecure versions being installed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting the underlying vulnerability in `enshrined/svg-sanitize` is not directly specified in the provided commit message. More information on the `enshrined/svg-sanitize` library vulnerability would be needed to determine the impact (e.g., XSS, SSRF, etc.). However, in general, improper sanitization of SVGs can lead to various security issues.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector would depend on the specific vulnerability in the `enshrined/svg-sanitize` library. Generally, it would likely involve uploading or using a crafted SVG file that exploits a vulnerability in its parsing or sanitization process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker would need the ability to upload or otherwise inject a malicious SVG file into a system that uses the vulnerable version of the `svg_sanitizer` Drupal module. This could involve, for example, the Drupal user interface, or through other data ingestion methods.
