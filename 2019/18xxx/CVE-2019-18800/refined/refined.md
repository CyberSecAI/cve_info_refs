- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how Viber handles account reset requests, allowing an attacker with access to the victim's network traffic to intercept and manipulate the request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure account reset mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can remotely reset a victim's Viber account.
- **Attack vectors**: Network traffic interception (e.g., public Wi-Fi, compromised Wi-Fi, ISP or network admin access)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to capture the victim's internet traffic. This could involve being on the same public Wi-Fi network, having cracked the Wi-Fi password, being an ISP, or a network administrator.
