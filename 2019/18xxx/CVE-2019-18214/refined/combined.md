## Description

The Video\_Converter app 0.1.0 for Nextcloud allows denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via multiple concurrent conversions because many FFmpeg processes may be running at once. (The workload is not queued for serial execution.)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@xkill](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/208463?v=4&size=48)[xkill](https://github.com/xkill)opened [on Oct 18, 2019](https://github.com/PaulLereverend/NextcloudVideo_Converter/issues/22#issue-509026893)

Hi,

I think that having a queue for multiple conversions.

If a server is doing multiple conversions, even if it all of them are with low priority, it hangs.

I suggest to have a queue, allowing only one (or multiple, settings could be changed) process at the same time.

The queue can be changed using the priorities, so when a high priority process is added to the queue, it should be at the top of the queue.

The users should be able to see the queue status. Not other users queue, but the position on the list. For example if the queue is:

1. user1 -> video1 -> processing....
2. user1 -> video2
3. user2 -> video3
4. user3 -> video4
5. user1 -> video5

The user1, can see the queue as:

1. user1 -> video1 -> position 1 -> processing....
2. user1 -> video2 -> position 2
3. user1 -> video5 -> position 5

The user2, only can see the queue as:

3. user2 -> video3 -> position 3

The users should also be able to cancel the queued jobs and, potentially cancel the current process.

NOTE: It is a security issue as the users can generate a DoS because of several concurrent processes.

EDIT: The denial of service can be done because two factors:

* CPU consuming
* RAM consuming (multiple instances of ffmpeg consume a lot of RAM)
