The provided content discusses a side-channel vulnerability related to OLED displays in hardware wallets, including the Shift Cryptosecurity BitBox02, which is the product associated with CVE-2019-18673.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way OLED displays work. They illuminate pixels line-by-line, and each pixel requires a relatively large amount of current. This results in fluctuations in the power consumption of the device based on the number of pixels lit on each row.
*   These fluctuations can be measured on the USB power line, creating a side channel that leaks information about the display contents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **OLED power consumption side-channel:** The primary weakness is the correlation between the displayed content and the power consumption, specifically due to the way OLEDs illuminate pixels. This is described as a non-invasive attack vector.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially recover sensitive information displayed on the OLED screen by analyzing the power consumption patterns. This can include PIN codes or BIP39 mnemonic words, which are critical for accessing cryptocurrency wallets.
*   The severity depends on the specific device and whether sensitive data is displayed on screen

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Power analysis:** An attacker can monitor the power consumption of the device while it displays data on the screen, usually by measuring voltage fluctuations on the USB power line.
*   **Physical Access:** This attack requires physical access to the device's USB cable/port for power analysis.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Physical proximity:** The attacker needs to be close enough to the device to connect monitoring equipment to the USB power line.
*   **Technical skills:** They need to be able to perform power analysis, typically requiring specialized equipment like an oscilloscope or software-defined radio to measure the voltage fluctuations accurately.
*   **Knowledge of display patterns:** Some degree of understanding how the display works and the correlation between displayed data and power consumption patterns is needed for effective analysis.

**Specific information related to BitBox02:**
* The BitBox02 is mentioned in the context of having this vulnerability, specifically referencing the OLED power consumption side-channel vulnerability.
* The Shift Cryptosecurity reference link related to CVE-2019-18673 details non-invasive attacks, which includes the OLED power consumption side-channel attack.
* The BitBox02 uses well known open-source cryptographic libraries that run in constant time to prevent side-channel attacks, but the OLED power consumption side-channel had not yet been addressed at the time of the article.
