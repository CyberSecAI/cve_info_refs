However it adds another complexity on top of an already existing pile of complexity. The logic in question fixes a packaging bug that was existing from 2008 to end of 2018.  If we remove this logic then any still affected users may suffer data loss (the ownership information for their TPM).  If could try to fix this by making the %posttrans section even more hacky, e.g. temporarily changing ownership of /var/lib/tpm back to root, then try to restore the backup files safely with checks against symlinks.  Another attempt could be to just move away the wrongly packaged files to a safe location like /usr/share/trousers/$FILE.rpmnew. Then add an update-message to zypper informing the user about the situation. However, this update-message only shows on the command line, not in YAST or in GUI package manager helpers.  TrouSerS is not the most active of packages and tpm 1.2 is not state of the art any more. Still we support in on SLE where we have the same problem. So any good suggestions? :-) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c2)  Malte Kraus   2019-11-25 12:14:01 UTC  ``` wouldn't this work:  1. use 'mv --no-target-directory' to prevent mv from moving a file to an unintended place 2. use 'chown --no-dereference' to prevent chowning something outside /var/lib/tpm ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-25 13:11:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to malte.kraus@suse.com from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c2)) > wouldn't this work: >  > 1. use 'mv --no-target-directory' to prevent mv from moving a file to an unintended place > 2. use 'chown --no-dereference' to prevent chowning something outside /var/lib/tpm  Yeah this might just barely work. What I don't like about it is that the documentation about the switches sounds like these are not necessarily security features, but simply features. Therefore a race free implementation of them might just be a nice side-effect.  While the code in chown looks sufficiently sane, the mv code is far spreaded and a lot of different situations are covered there where I can't say on the first spot whether this will be immune to all kinds of shenanigans. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 09:13:50 UTC  ``` So I discussed this a bit more with Malte. Adjusting the invocation of mv and chown should suffice as a best effort approach at the moment. But I will have to check which codestreams are also affected by this and if the mv and chown utilities work accordingly there, too. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 10:00:58 UTC  ``` Making this bug public since I'm doing OBS submissions for it. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-26 10:40:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157651) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/750985> Factory / trousers ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 10:46:39 UTC  ``` The affected %posttrans section is only found in the SLE-15 and SLE-15-SP1 codestreams. I will submit maintenance updates there. The necessary mv/chown switches should be present there as well. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 11:09:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to matthias.gerstner@suse.com from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c7)) > The affected %posttrans section is only found in the SLE-15 and SLE-15-SP1 > codestreams.  Somehow I made a bad lookup. The %posttrans section is only found in SLE-15-SP1 and NOT in SLE-15. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c9)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 11:43:39 UTC  ``` I've submitted the fix to Factory and SLE-15-SP1:Update. This should deal with the situtation from my side. Assigning back to the security-team. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-12-19 20:14:05 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:3349-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

However it adds another complexity on top of an already existing pile of complexity. The logic in question fixes a packaging bug that was existing from 2008 to end of 2018.  If we remove this logic then any still affected users may suffer data loss (the ownership information for their TPM).  If could try to fix this by making the %posttrans section even more hacky, e.g. temporarily changing ownership of /var/lib/tpm back to root, then try to restore the backup files safely with checks against symlinks.  Another attempt could be to just move away the wrongly packaged files to a safe location like /usr/share/trousers/$FILE.rpmnew. Then add an update-message to zypper informing the user about the situation. However, this update-message only shows on the command line, not in YAST or in GUI package manager helpers.  TrouSerS is not the most active of packages and tpm 1.2 is not state of the art any more. Still we support in on SLE where we have the same problem. So any good suggestions? :-) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c2)  Malte Kraus   2019-11-25 12:14:01 UTC  ``` wouldn't this work:  1. use 'mv --no-target-directory' to prevent mv from moving a file to an unintended place 2. use 'chown --no-dereference' to prevent chowning something outside /var/lib/tpm ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-25 13:11:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to malte.kraus@suse.com from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c2)) > wouldn't this work: >  > 1. use 'mv --no-target-directory' to prevent mv from moving a file to an unintended place > 2. use 'chown --no-dereference' to prevent chowning something outside /var/lib/tpm  Yeah this might just barely work. What I don't like about it is that the documentation about the switches sounds like these are not necessarily security features, but simply features. Therefore a race free implementation of them might just be a nice side-effect.  While the code in chown looks sufficiently sane, the mv code is far spreaded and a lot of different situations are covered there where I can't say on the first spot whether this will be immune to all kinds of shenanigans. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 09:13:50 UTC  ``` So I discussed this a bit more with Malte. Adjusting the invocation of mv and chown should suffice as a best effort approach at the moment. But I will have to check which codestreams are also affected by this and if the mv and chown utilities work accordingly there, too. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 10:00:58 UTC  ``` Making this bug public since I'm doing OBS submissions for it. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-26 10:40:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1157651) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/750985> Factory / trousers ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 10:46:39 UTC  ``` The affected %posttrans section is only found in the SLE-15 and SLE-15-SP1 codestreams. I will submit maintenance updates there. The necessary mv/chown switches should be present there as well. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 11:09:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to matthias.gerstner@suse.com from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c7)) > The affected %posttrans section is only found in the SLE-15 and SLE-15-SP1 > codestreams.  Somehow I made a bad lookup. The %posttrans section is only found in SLE-15-SP1 and NOT in SLE-15. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c9)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 11:43:39 UTC  ``` I've submitted the fix to Factory and SLE-15-SP1:Update. This should deal with the situtation from my side. Assigning back to the security-team. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1157651#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-12-19 20:14:05 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:3349-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
