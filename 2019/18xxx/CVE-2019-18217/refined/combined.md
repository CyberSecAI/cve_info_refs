## Description

![@msg7086](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206155?v=4&size=48)[msg7086](https://github.com/msg7086)opened [on May 9, 2019](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/807#issue-442375790)
### What I Did

I configured TLS on ProFTPD using SSLv23, and FlashFXP (with only TLSv1.2 support) does not work with it. In fact, any client that does not use TLSv1.3 does not work with it.

### What I Expected/Wanted

Server accepts connections for both TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 given that SSLv23 means "all versions".

*or*

Document the behavior that SSLv23 no longer works in this way.

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the1.3.9 release cycle, from the 1.3.9rc1 release to the 1.3.9 maintenancereleases. More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS andChangeLog files.
1.3.9rc3---------
 + When started with root privileges, ProFTPD now drops all supplemental group memberships, retaining only the UID/GID of the configured User/Group.
 + Properly use all configured ECDSA SSH hostkeys, not just the first configured ECSA SSH hostkey.
 + Fixed issue with RADIUS authentication when using mod\_radius and newer FreeRADIUS, due to BlastRadius mitigation.
 + New Directives
 SFTPAuthPublicKeys
 This directive can be used to enable support for only the specified list of public key algorithms, as for key-based user authentication. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPAuthPublicKeys for more.
 + Changed Directives
 SFTPExtensions +limits The mod\_sftp module now implements the "limits@openssh.com" custom SFTP extension, used by newer OpenSSH limitations for discovering server-side limits, such as larger SFTP READ/WRITE buffer lengths. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPExtensions.
1.3.9rc2---------
 + Implemented SSH mitigations for the "Terrapin" SSH attack (CVE-2023-48795).
 + Fixed compiling of 3rd party modules whose names match very specific regular expression patterns.
 + Changed Directives
 SFTPOptions NoStrictKex
 By default, mod\_sftp uses a "strict KEX" mode as a mitigation for the "Terrapin" SSH attack (CVE-2023-48795). Use of this strict mode may unexpectedly cause interoperability issues; this new SFTPOption can be used to disable this mode if necessary. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for more.
1.3.9rc1---------
 + Clients are disconnected if there is an error adding them to the ScoreboardFile. Previously, such errors were logged, but the session allowed to continue.
 + Implemented the "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" SSH cipher algorithm.
 + Implemented support for OpenSSH FIDO security keys in mod\_sftp.
 + The mod\_auth\_otp module now requires per-user entries in its tables by default. This is a change from previous versions, when such per-user entries were optional.
 + New Directives
 IfSessionOptions PerUnauthenticatedUser
 The mod\_ifsession module only applies its user/group-specific configurations after the client has authenticated itself. Some sites, however, may wish for user-specific configurations to be applied based on the unauthenticated username supplied by the client, such as in cases where the conditional configuration in question will affect the authentication process. The new PerUnauthenticatedUser IfSessionOption can be used to achieve this; see doc/contrib/mod\_ifsession.html#IfSessionOptions for more.
 ScoreboardOptions AllowMissingEntry
 Clients are now disconnected if they cannot be added to the ScoreboardFile. Some sites may require the previous behavior; use this new AllowMissingEntry ScoreboardOption to do so. See doc/modules/mod\_core.html#ScoreboardOptions for more information.
 + Changed Directives
 AuthOTPOptions OptionalTableEntry
 Now that the mod\_auth\_otp module requires an entry for each user, sites may need to re-enable the previous opt-in behavior. Use the OptionalTableEntry AuthOTPOption for this. Read doc/contrib/mod\_auth\_otp.html#AuthOTPOptions for details.
 DelayOnEvent Connect
 The DelayOnEvent directive can now be used to inject randomized delays, "jitter", at the start of a session. This can be used to spread out the processing of a large number of connections that occur at the same time, such as on a schedule/cron. See doc/modules/mod\_delay.html#DelayOnEvent for details.
 ExtendedLog SEC class
 SSH key exchange requests are now classified as "security" related messages, and thus are logged in ExtendedLog configurations that use the SEC logging class.
 LDAPDefaultGID, LDAPDefaultUID Auto
 Retrieving the UID, GID to use for users configured in ActiveDirectory domains, based on the default/expected attributes, is not always possible. In such cases, the new "Auto" value for the default UID, GID to use by mod\_ldap allows for retrieving the actual UID, GID by system user lookup, which is handled for AD domains by the special `sssd` program, for example.
 LogFormat %{transfer-speed}
 The LogFormat directive now supports a variable, %{transfer-speed}, for logging the average data transfer speed.
 SFTPCiphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
 The mod\_sftp module now implements OpenSSH's "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" algorithm.
 SFTPExtensions userGroupNames
 The mod\_sftp module supports the custom OpenSSH "users-groups-by-id@openssh.com" SFTP extension, used to retrieve the textual user/group names for given lists of UIDs, GIDs.
 SFTPOptions FIDOTouchRequired FIDOVerifyRequired
 OpenSSH FIDO security keys, such as Yubikeys, are now supported for SSH authentication by the mod\_sftp module. These keys allow for policies such as proof of user presence, and/or proof of user verification. These new SFTPOptions can be used to configure your site policies for such keys; see doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for more information.
 + Developer Notes
 Removed the unused `pr\_ctrls\_parse\_msg` Controls API function.

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for proftpd fixes the following issues:
\* GeoIP has been discontinued by Maxmind (boo#1156210) This update removes
module build for geoip see
<https://support.maxmind.com/geolite-legacy-discontinuation-notice/>
- CVE-2019-19269: Fixed a NULL pointer dereference may occur when
validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server
(boo#1157803)
- CVE-2019-19270: Fixed a Failure to check for the appropriate field of a
CRL entry prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account
(boo#1157798)
- CVE-2019-18217: Fixed remote unauthenticated denial-of-service due to
incorrect handling of overly long commands (boo#1154600 gh#846)
Update to 1.3.6b
\* Fixed pre-authentication remote denial-of-service issue (Issue #846).
\* Backported fix for building mod\_sql\_mysql using MySQL 8 (Issue #824).
Update to 1.3.6a:
\* Fixed symlink navigation (Bug#4332).
\* Fixed building of mod\_sftp using OpenSSL 1.1.x releases (Issue#674).
\* Fixed SITE COPY honoring of <Limit> restrictions (Bug#4372).
\* Fixed segfault on login when using mod\_sftp + mod\_sftp\_pam (Issue#656).
\* Fixed restarts when using mod\_facl as a static module
\* Add missing Requires(pre): group(ftp) for Leap 15 and Tumbleweed
(boo#1155834)
\* Add missing Requires(pre): user(ftp) for Leap 15 and Tumbleweed
(boo#1155834)
\* Use pam\_keyinit.so (boo#1144056)
- Reduce hard dependency on systemd to only that which is necessary for
building and installation.
update to 1.3.6:
\* Support for using Redis for caching, logging; see the
doc/howto/Redis.html documentation.
\* Fixed mod\_sql\_postgres SSL support (Issue #415).
\* Support building against LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL (Issue #361).
\* Better support on AIX for login restraictions (Bug #4285).
\* TimeoutLogin (and other timeouts) were not working properly for SFTP
connections (Bug#4299).
\* Handling of the SIGILL and SIGINT signals, by the daemon process, now
causes the child processes to be terminated as well (Issue #461).
\* RPM .spec file naming changed to conform to Fedora guidelines.
\* Fix for "AllowChrootSymlinks off" checking each component for symlinks
(CVE-2017-7418).
New Modules:
\* mod\_redis, mod\_tls\_redis, mod\_wrap2\_redis With Redis now supported as a
caching mechanism, similar to Memcache, there are now Redis-using
modules: mod\_redis (for configuring the Redis connection information),
mod\_tls\_redis (for caching SSL sessions and OCSP information using
Redis), and mod\_wrap2\_redis (for using ACLs stored in Redis).
Changed Modules:
\* mod\_ban: The mod\_ban module's BanCache directive can now use Redis-based
caching; see doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanCache.
-New Configuration Directives
\* SQLPasswordArgon2, SQLPasswordScrypt
The key lengths for Argon2 and Scrypt-based passwords are now
configurable via these new directives; previously, the key length had been
hardcoded to be 32 bytes, which is not interoperable with all other
implementations (Issue #454).
Changed Configuration Directives
\* AllowChrootSymlinks When "AllowChrootSymlinks off" was used, only the
last portion of the DefaultRoot path would be checked to see if it was a
symlink. Now, each component of the DefaultRoot path will be checked to
see if it is a symlink when "AllowChrootSymlinks off" is used.
\* Include The Include directive can now be used within a <Limit> section,
e.g.: <Limit LOGIN> Include /path/to/allowed.txt DenyAll </Limit> API
Changes
\* A new JSON API has been added, for use by third-party modules.

# CVE-2017-7418

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2017-7407.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2017-7426.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2017-7418 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7418)

#### Description

ProFTPD before 1.3.5e and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc5 controls whether the home directory of a user could contain a symbolic link through the AllowChrootSymlinks configuration option, but checks only the last path component when enforcing AllowChrootSymlinks. Attackers with local access could bypass the AllowChrootSymlinks control by replacing a path component (other than the last one) with a symbolic link. The threat model includes an attacker who is not granted full filesystem access by a hosting provider, but can reconfigure the home directory of an FTP user.

# CVE-2019-19270

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-19269.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-19271.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-19270 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19270)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in tls\_verify\_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure to check for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather than once for subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.

This file contains a description of the major changes to ProFTPD for the1.3.6 release cycle, from the 1.3.6rc1 release to the 1.3.6 maintenancereleases. More information on these changes can be found in the NEWS andChangeLog files.
1.3.6e--------- + Fixed null pointer deference in mod\_sftp when using SCP incorrectly (Issue #1043).
1.3.6d--------- + Fixed issue with FTPS uploads of large files using TLSv1.3 (Issue #959).
1.3.6c--------- + Fixed regression in directory listing latency (Issue #863). + Detect OpenSSH-specific formatted SFTPHostKeys, and log hint for converting them to supported format. + Fixed use-after-free vulnerability during data transfers (Issue #903). + Fixed out-of-bounds read in mod\_cap by updating the bundled libcap (Issue #902).
1.3.6b--------- + Fixed pre-authentication remote denial-of-service issue (Issue #846). + Backported fix for building mod\_sql\_mysql using MySQL 8 (Issue #824).
1.3.6a--------- + Fixed symlink navigation (Bug#4332). + Fixed building of mod\_sftp using OpenSSL 1.1.x releases (Issue#674). + Fixed SITE COPY honoring of <Limit> restrictions (Bug#4372). + Fixed segfault on login when using mod\_sftp + mod\_sftp\_pam (Issue#656). + Fixed restarts when using mod\_facl as a static module.
1.3.6---------
 + Support for using Redis for caching, logging; see the doc/howto/Redis.html documentation. + Fixed mod\_sql\_postgres SSL support (Issue #415). + Support building against LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL (Issue #361). + Better support on AIX for login restraictions (Bug #4285). + TimeoutLogin (and other timeouts) were not working properly for SFTP connections (Bug#4299). + Handling of the SIGILL and SIGINT signals, by the daemon process, now causes the child processes to be terminated as well (Issue #461). + RPM .spec file naming changed to conform to Fedora guidelines. + Fix for "AllowChrootSymlinks off" checking each component for symlinks (CVE-2017-7418).
 + New Modules:
 mod\_redis, mod\_tls\_redis, mod\_wrap2\_redis With Redis now supported as a caching mechanism, similar to Memcache, there are now Redis-using modules: mod\_redis (for configuring the Redis connection information), mod\_tls\_redis (for caching SSL sessions and OCSP information using Redis), and mod\_wrap2\_redis (for using ACLs stored in Redis).
 See the respective module documentation for details: doc/modules/mod\_redis.html, doc/contrib/mod\_tls\_redis.html, and doc/contrib/mod\_wrap2\_redis.html.
 + Changed Modules:
 mod\_ban The mod\_ban module's BanCache directive can now use Redis-based caching; see doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanCache.
 + New Configuration Directives
 SQLPasswordArgon2, SQLPasswordScrypt The key lengths for Argon2 and Scrypt-based passwords are now configurable via these new directives; previously, the key length had been hardcoded to be 32 bytes, which is not interoperable with all other implementations (Issue #454).
 See doc/contrib/mod\_sql\_passwd.html#SQLPasswordArgon2, doc/contrib/mod\_sql\_passwd.html#SQLPasswordScrypt for details.
 + Changed Configuration Directives
 AllowChrootSymlinks When "AllowChrootSymlinks off" was used, only the last portion of the DefaultRoot path would be checked to see if it was a symlink. Now, each component of the DefaultRoot path will be checked to see if it is a symlink when "AllowChrootSymlinks off" is used.
 Include The Include directive can now be used within a <Limit> section, e.g.:
 <Limit LOGIN> Include /path/to/allowed.txt DenyAll </Limit>
 + API Changes
 A new JSON API has been added, for use by third-party modules.
1.3.6rc4---------
 + Fixed regression where all normal FTP users were handled as anonymous users.
1.3.6rc3---------
 + Support for OpenSSL 1.1.x API changes. + mod\_sftp uses SHA256 for publickey fingerprints by default, rather than SHA1 or MD5. + mod\_sql\_passwd supports Scrypt and Argon2 password hashing algorithms when libsodium is detected in the header/library directories. + mod\_sftp now supports extended attributes (xattrs) via SFTP. + Fixed bug in filesystem free space calculation causing ALLO to fail unexpectedly. + Default FTP/SSH2 banner changed to no longer include version information. + New -X command-line option for disabling forking, to aid debugging. + Logging of stacktraces now enabled by default; this also means that the installed executables do not have symbols stripped at install time. + Fixed memory leak when the mod\_facl module is used. + Support for UNIX.ownername and UNIX.groupname MLSD/MLST facts. + Use initgroups(3) for group membership discovery by default, as it is faster/more performant on most systems. For the previous behavior, use the NoInitgroups AuthUnixOption.
 + Changed Modules:
 mod\_ctrls\_admin The mod\_ctrls\_admin module supports a new "config" ftpdctl action, which can be used to dynamically change configuration directives in the running daemon. See doc/contrib/mod\_ctrls\_admin.html#config for more details.
 + New Configuration Directives:
 CopyOptions The mod\_copy module now supports a CopyOptions directive, for tweaking particular behaviors such as how to handle copy failures. See the documentation at doc/contrib/mod\_copy.html#CopyOptions for details.
 DigestDefaultAlgorithm The mod\_digest module uses the SHA1 algorithm for digests by default. Use the DigestDefaultAlgorithm to change this default as needed; see doc/contrib/mod\_digest.html#DigestDefaultAlgorithm.
 FSOptions The --enable-xattr compile option enables support for extended attributes. There will be cases where this support needs to be disabled at runtime; use this option for doing so. See doc/modules/mod\_core.html#FSOptions for more information.
 IncludeOptions The Include directive now supports wildcarded directory names. However, this behavior may not be desirable or have other consequences. Use the new IncludeOptions directive for altering this behavior, such as ignoring temporary files:
 IncludeOptions IgnoreTempFiles
 For other options, see the documentation at doc/modules/mod\_core.html#IncludeOptions.
 MaxPasswordSize A denial-of-service attack can be mounted by causing excessive CPU usage via very long passwords processed via the crypt(3) function. To mitigate such resource consumption attacks, ProFTPD now imposes a maximum limit on the password length; that limit can be configured via this directive, documented at doc/modules/mod\_auth.html#MaxPasswordSize.
 SFTPKeyLimits As cryptographic attacks grow more sophisticated, shorter keys become more at risk of compromise. The SFTPKeyLimits directive provides the administrator a way to set stronger policies by imposing a minimum key length for the various types of keys: RSA, DSA, ECC. For more information, see doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPKeyLimits.
 SQLPasswordCost When libsodium support is detected by the build system, memory-hard algorithms such as scrypt and Argon2 are supported by the mod\_sql\_passwd module. These algorithms have tunable "costs"; the new SQLPasswordCost directive is for such tunings; see doc/contrib/mod\_sql\_passwd.html#SQLPasswordCost.
 + Changed Configuration Directives:
 AuthUnixOption ProFTPD will now try to use the initgroups(3) library function for group discovery by default. If this change of behavior leads to issues, the previous behavior can be restored using this new NoInitgroups AuthUnixOption. See doc/modules/mod\_auth\_unix.html#AuthUnixOptions for details.
 CapabilitiesEngine The CapabilitiesEngine directive of the mod\_cap module was not being properly honored when used within <IfUser> or <IfGroup> sections; this has now been fixed.
 FactsOptions The MLSD/MLST responses now include the UNIX.ownername and UNIX.groupname facts, for providing the textual labels. Some FTP clients may not handle these facts; use this new NoNames FactsOption value to have these new name facts not included in the MLSD/MLST responses by default. The documentation at doc/modules/mod\_facts.html#FactsOptions contains more information.
 GeoIPAllowFilter, GeoIPDenyFilter The GeoIPAllowFilter and GeoIPDenyFilter directives of the mod\_geoip module now support reading the filter data on a per-user basis, and support reading the filter data from SQL databases via a SQLNamedQuery. See the doc/contrib/mod\_geoip.html#GeoIPAllowFilter documentation for details and examples.
 Include The Include directive now supported wildcarded directory names, e.g.:
 Include /path/to/sites/\*/proftpd.conf
 Previously wildcards were only allowed as part of the filename. For more details, see doc/modules/mod\_core.html#Include.
 ListOptions The mod\_ls module returns file names for the NLST command in the order in which the names are provided by the underlying filesystem via the readdir(2) function. For many filesystems, the names are not ordered. However, some legacy FTP applications may assume/expect that the NLST names are orded. For such cases, use the new SortedNLST ListOption; see doc/modules/mod\_ls.html#ListOptions.
 MasqueradeAddress The MasqueradeAddress directive is now allowed in <Global> sections, to ease configuration for name-based virtual hosts.
 SFTPKeyExchanges The mod\_sftp module now supports the "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org" SSH key exchange algorithm, when compiled with the libsodium library.
 In addition, the following key exchange algorithms are supported:
 diffie-hellman-group14-sha256 diffie-hellman-group16-sha512 diffie-hellman-group18-sha512
 SFTPOptions There are several new SFTPOptions supported:
 IgnoreFIFOs IgnoreSFTPSetExtendedAttributes IgnoreSFTPUploadExtendedAttributes
 The doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions documentation covers these new options in greater detail.
 + API Changes
 Many of the core API have been const-ified. This will cause build warnings in many existing third-party modules.
1.3.6rc2---------
 + SSH RSA hostkeys smaller than 2048 bits now work properly. + MLSD response lines are now properly CRLF terminated. + Faster/more efficient FTP ASCII mode conversion code. + Support for OCSP stapling. + Support for the common CLNT FTP command. + Fixed selection of DH groups from TLSDHParamFile.
 + New Modules:
 mod\_auth\_otp The mod\_auth\_otp module supports one-time passwords using the HOTP and TOTP algorithms. This OTP support is compatible with e.g. Google Authenticator and other implementations. The mod\_auth\_otp module can thus be used to provide multi-factor authentication (MFA, 2FA) for both FTP and SFTP logins. For more information, see the module documentation at doc/contrib/mod\_auth\_otp.html.
 mod\_digest The mod\_digest module implements the HASH FTP command, per the IETF Draft. This module also implements previous FTP commands that achieve similar functionality, e.g. XCRC, XMD5, XSHA1, and others. See the full module documentation at doc/contrib/mod\_digest.html.
 mod\_statcache Some sites often act as "mirrors", and/or have clients which perform numerous, repeated, and expensive directory listings. These directory listings cause repetitive (and often redundant) lookups of the per-file details via the stat(2) and lstat(2) system calls. The mod\_statcache module caches this "stat" information, such that the cached data can be shared/reused across multiple FTP sessions. See doc/contrib/mod\_statcache.html for details.
 + New Configuration Directives:
 AllowEmptyPasswords By default, proftpd allows for empty passwords to be used for authentication. Some sites may wish to enforce the requirement that passwords not be empty; this can now be accomplished via the AllowEmptyPasswords directive, e.g.:
 # Require non-empty passwords AllowEmptyPasswords on
 See doc/modules/mod\_auth.html#AllowEmptyPasswords for details. Note that this applies to mod\_sftp password-based logins as well.
 AnonAllowRobots Some web crawlers, notably Google, will automatically index any FTP sites with anonymous logins. This behavior is now automatically prohibited, using auto-generated robots.txt files for <Anonymous> logins. Use the new AnonAllowRobots directive to allow indexing again; see doc/modules/mod\_auth.html#AnonAllowRobots for details.
 SQLODBCVersion The mod\_sql\_odbc module defaults to using ODBC API version 3. However, some ODBC drivers may themselves expect older versions of the ODBC API. This can now be configured using e.g. "SQLODBCVersion ODBCv2"; see doc/contrib/mod\_sql\_odbc.html#SQLODBCVersion for more information.
 TLSSessionTickets The mod\_tls module now supports TLS session tickets, per RFC 5077. See doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSSessionTicketKeys for more details.
 TLSStapling The mod\_tls module now supports OCSP stapling by caching OCSP responses for server certificates, and stapling those OCSP responses in the SSL/TLS handshake data. This OCSP stapling functionality is configuring using new directives:
 TLSStaplingCache TLSStaplingOptions TLSStaplingResponder TLSStaplingTimeout
 See the doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html documentation for more information.
 + Changed Modules
 The mod\_sftp module now supports the LINK\_COUNT attribute in SFTP STAT requests, for clients using SFTP protocol version 6. It also supports the "hardlink@openssh.com" SFTP extension.
 The mod\_tls\_memcache and mod\_tls\_shmcache modules now provide OCSP responder caches.
 + Changed Configuration Directives:
 BanCacheOptions When storing ban rules in memcached, the mod\_ban module can now format the rules as JSON, allowing for better interoperability with other applications interested in those ban rules. To use JSON, use "BanCacheOptions UseJSON"; see doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanCacheOptions for more information.
 BanOnEvent The mod\_ban module can now be configured to ban clients which attempt to use empty passwords, when the new AllowEmptyPasswords directive is set to "false", via the new EmptyPassword BanOnEvent rule. See doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanOnEvent for more information.
 LogFormat The mod\_log module supports several new LogFormat variables. The %R variable can be used for logging command response time, in milliseconds, which is useful for measuring response time/latency. Data transfer durations are separately tracked using the new %{transfer-millisecs} variable. For logging the size of the file after data transfer (e.g. after upload), use the %{file-size} variable. And for logging whether the file transfer used binary or ASCII mode, use the %{transfer-type} variable.
 MasqueradeAddress Sometimes the DNS name configured for MasqueradeAddress directives cannot be resolved when ProFTPD starts up, such as when the network interface on the host machine has not yet come up. This would cause ProFTPD to fail to start.
 The MasqueradeAddress directive now handles these resolution errors, and will attempt to resolve the DNS name later, when clients connect; this allows ProFTPD to start up properly in such cases.
 SFTPAuthMethods The mod\_sftp module now supports requiring multiple authentication methods for a single login. Some sites, for example, wish for clients to authenticate via publickey AND password. This is supported via the SFTPAuthMethods directive, e.g.:
 # Require both publickey and password authentication, in any order SFTPAuthMethods publickey+password password+publickey
 The doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPAuthMethods documentation has more information.
 SFTPExtensions The mod\_sftp module now supports the "hardlink@openssh.com" SFTP extension. To disable support for this extension, use:
 SFTPExtensions -hardlink
 See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPExtensions for details.
 SQLConnectInfo, SQLNamedConnectInfo The mod\_sql module can now support using SSL/TLS for connections to backend databases, if supported by the database-specific module, by configuring the necessary SSL/TLS details using the SQLConnectInfo and SQLNamedConnectInfo directives. See their respective documentation, doc/contrib/mod\_sql.html#SQLConnectInfo and doc/contrib/mod\_sql.html#SQLNamedConnectInfo for more information.
 TLSOptions The NoCertRequest TLSOption is now deprecated. The mod\_tls module, rather than requesting client certificates every time, will only do so if "TLSVerifyClient on" or "TLSVerifyClient optional" is configured. This brings the mod\_tls behavior more in line with Apache behavior, and slightly reduces the SSL/TLS handshake latency.
 TLSProtocol The mod\_tls module now supports excluding of particular SSL/TLS versions via the TLSProtocol directive, e.g.:
 # Support all TLS versions except SSLv3 TLSProtocol ALL -SSLv3
 The doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSProtocol documentation has more details.
 TLSSessionCache When storing SSL session data in memcached, the mod\_tls module can now format the session data using JSON, allowing for better interoperability with other applications interested in that session data. To use JSON, use "TLSSessionCache memcache:/json". See doc/contrib/mod\_tls\_memcache.html for more information.
 UseEncoding Different users/clients may wish to use different filename encodings for their files. The UseEncoding directive can now be set per-user/group/class, by now working with mod\_ifsession sections as expected.
1.3.6rc1---------
 + Support the HOST command (see RFC 7151). + Changed the default SyslogLevel to be NOTICE, rather than DEBUG. + Fixed "stalled" SSL/TLS handshakes for data transfers. + ftpwho now supports JSON output format. + Fixed handling of SSH keys with overlong Comment headers in mod\_sftp\_sql. + Changed handling of logging of SFTP sessions to ExtendedLogs; see the notes below on the ExtendedLog directive.
 + Changed Modules
 mod\_facl The mod\_facl module now supports the MacOSX flavour of POSIX ACLs.
 mod\_radius The mod\_radius module has added support for the following RADIUS attributes:
 Acct-Terminate-Cause Event-Timestamp Idle-Timeout Message-Authenticator Reply-Message Session-Timeout
 mod\_site\_misc The SITE UTIME command now supports the 3-timestamp variant:
 SITE UTIME path atime mtime ctime
 where each timestamp is expressed as "YYYYMMDDhhmmss".
 mod\_sql The mod\_sql module would previously only support 32-bit UID/GID values, due to its use of the atoi(3) C library function for parsing result set values into IDs. This has been fixed; mod\_sql now properly supports 64-bit UID/GID values.
 mod\_tls By default, mod\_tls will no longer support SSLv3 connections. In order to support SSLv3 connections (for sites that need to), you must explicitly configure this via the TLSProtocol directive, e.g.:
 TLSProtocol SSLv3 TLSv1 ...
 In addition, mod\_tls will no longer support EXPORT ciphers.
 + New Configuration Directives:
 CopyEngine The mod\_copy module is enabled by default; there may be cases where the module should be disabled, without requiring a rebuild of the server. Thus mod\_copy now supports a CopyEngine directive; see doc/contrib/mod\_copy.html#CopyEngine.
 DelayOnEvent There are sites which wish to use mod\_delay for administratively adding delays to connections as e.g. brute force attack deterrents. To support these use cases, the mod\_delay module has a new DelayOnEvent directive. Using this directive, sites can configure something like the following, for forcing a minimum login delay and a failed login delay:
 <IfModule mod\_delay.c> # Configure successful logins to be delayed by 2 secs DelayOnEvent PASS 2000ms
 # Configure failed logins to be delayed by 5 secs DelayOnEvent FailedLogin 5s </IfModule>
 See doc/modules/mod\_delay.html#DelayOnEvent for more information.
 ExecEnable Some sites using mod\_exec need to configure a command to be executed, but wish to "blacklist" certain directories where that command should not be executed. To handle configurations like this, the mod\_exec module has a new ExecEnable directive; see doc/contrib/mod\_exec.html#ExecEnable for details.
 FSCachePolicy ProFTPD has long maintained a cache of the last stat data for a file. However, for performance reasons, this cache size needs to be larger, and to be enhanced to handle expiration, etc. To tune the size and expiration settings of this filesystem data cache, use the new FSCachePolicy directive; see doc/modules/mod\_core.html#FSCachePolicy for details.
 LangOptions Currently proftpd tries to cope with various filename/character encodings used by FTP clients; if it cannot decode the filename, it will use the sent filename as-is. This behavior can cause problems for downstream resources that then attempt to deal with these filenames, and fail. To make proftpd be more strict about the encoding it accepts, use the new LangOption directive:
 LangOptions RequireValidEncoding
 See doc/modules/mod\_lang.html#LangOptions.
 RadiusOptions The mod\_radius module now supports/handles additional RADIUS attributes. Some of these attribute may need to be ignore for some sites; others may wish to e.g. enforce stronger security by requiring the use of the Message-Authenticator attribute. Thus mod\_radius has a new RadiusOptions directive; see doc/contrib/mod\_radius.html#RadiusOptions for details.
 ServerAlias Supporting true name-based virtual hosting means needing to associate names with the IP-based virtual hosts. The ServerAlias directive is used to do this association; see doc/modules/mod\_core.html#ServerAlias for details.
 SQLPasswordSaltEncoding In order to handle binary data for salts, the mod\_sql\_password module now supports handling of this data as base64- or hex-encoded data via the new SQLPasswordSaltEncoding directive; see doc/contrib/mod\_sql\_passwd.html#SQLPasswordSaltEncoding for details.
 TLSECDHCurve When an FTPS client uses an ECDHE cipher, mod\_tls currently will use the X9.62 <code>prime256v1</code> curve. Some sites may, however, wish to use other curves for ECDHE ciphers. These sites may now use the new TLSECDHCurve directive to configure the curve; see doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSECDHCurve for details.
 TLSNextProtocol Newer TLS clients use the ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) extension (or its earlier incarnation NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation) for determining the protocol that will be used over the SSL/TLS session. The support for these extensions can be used by clients for enabling other behaviors/optimizations, such as TLS False Start. This directive can be used to disable mod\_tls' use of the ALPN/NPN extensions as needed; see doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSNextProtocol for more details.
 TLSPreSharedKey Some sites may find that using pre-shared keys (PSK) is preferable for their TLS needs. TLS clients in embedded or low power environments may find PSK to be less computationally expensive. The mod\_tls module now supports pre-shared keys via its TLSPreSharedKey directive; see doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSPreSharedKey for details.
 TransferOptions There are some broken (<i>e.g.</i> old/mainframe) FTP clients that will upload files, containing CRLF sequences, as ASCII data, but these clients expect these CRLF sequences to be left as-is by the FTP server. To handle these broken clients, there is a new TransferOptions directive; see doc/modules/mod\_xfer.html#TransferOptions for more information.
 + Changed Configuration Directives
 BanOnEvent BadProtocol Some clients (malicious or unintentional) may send HTTP or SMTP commands to ProFTPD. ProFTPD now detects these "bad protocol" messages, and mod\_ban can now ban clients that repeatedly do this via its BanOnEvent rules. See doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanOnEvent for details.
 DelayTable none If the mod\_delay module is used to enforce minimum delays, and not use its DelayTable for "learning" the best delay, then the DelayTable is not needed/used to all. The DelayTable directive can now be used to tell mod\_delay to not even open/lock on that table, using:
 DelayTable none
 See doc/modules/mod\_delay.html#DelayTable.
 DeleteAbortedStores The DeleteAbortedStores directive, for Bug#3917, was meant to be enabled, but only when HiddenStores was in effect. Unfortunately, the fix caused a regression, as DeleteAbortedStores was enabled for ALL transfers inadvertently. The desired behavior, of enabling DeleteAbortedStores only when HiddenStores is in effect, has been properly implemented now.
 ExtendedLog When an ExtendedLog is used for logging mod\_sftp requests, the log file will contain both the SFTP requests AND the internal FTP commands to which mod\_sftp will map the SFTP requests; this can lead to some VERY verbose log files.
 For greater control over SFTP logging, the ExtendedLog directive now supports two new log classes: SSH, and SFTP. In addition, it supports the '!' prefix, for excluding certain log classes from a given ExtendedLog. For example:
 LogFormat ftp "..." ALL,EXIT,!SSH,!SFTP ExtendedLog /path/to/extended-ftp.log ftp
 LogFormat sftp "..." SSH,SFTP ExtendedLog /path/to/extended-sftp.log sftp
 NOTE that existing ExtendedLogs that expect to see the SFTP requests will no longer do so; adding the "SFTP" logging class to such ExtendedLogs is now necessary.
 HiddenStores Some sites may experience HiddenStores filename collisions when uploading FTP clients get disconnected, and/or use multiple concurrent sessions for uploading. To help avoid collisions, the HiddenStores directive now supports the %P variable, for adding the session PID to the generated HiddenStore name.
 In other cases, some sites may have FTP clients that want to use the APPE FTP command, but cannot do so when HiddenStores is in effect. These FTP clients are often outside of the site's control, and not easily changed. ProFTPD now automatically disables the HiddenStores functionality when an APPE FTP command is used; the APPE command can only function on an existing file anyway, and thus there is no loss of functionality with this policy change.
 ListOptions When ProFTPD generates a directory listing for FTP commands such as LIST or NLST, it will automatically sort the names lexicographically. For very wide directories, this can cause more memory/CPU usage, in order to sort all of these names. This sorting can now be disabled via ListOptions, using:
 ListOptions -U
 See doc/modules/mod\_ls.html#ListOptions for more information.
 SFTPDigests The mod\_sftp module now supports the umac-128@openssh.com MAC algorithm; see doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPDigests.
 SFTPHostKey Large hosting sites often use a <Global> section for centralizing configuration of a large number of <VirtualHost> sections in their proftpd.conf. Sometimes, such sites will want to disable use of particular SSH hostkeys for a given <VirtualHost>. To support this use case, the SFTPHostKey directive can be used to ignore any globally-configured RSA, DSA, or ECDSA SSH hostkey, e.g.:
 SFTPHostKey NoRSA SFTPHostKey NoDSA
 See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPHostKey for details.
 SFTPOptions Some OS distributions insist that their SSH hostkeys be group-readable. In order to allow mod\_sftp, which has more strict SSH hostkey permission policies, to use those SSH hostkeys, the SFTPOptions directive can now be used to relax this permission policy as needed:
 SFTPOptions InsecureHostKeyPerms
 See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions for details.
 Small Diffie-Hellman groups are subject to cryptographic weaknesses; see https://weakdh.org. Thus mod\_sftp now avoids the use of weak DH groups by default; the AllowWeakDH SFTPOption is used to re-enable such support for clients that require it. See doc/contrib/mod\_sftp.html#SFTPOptions.
 SNMPAgent Some sites may wish to have mod\_snmp listening on multiple addresses (e.g. on multi-homed servers), including IPv6 addresses. The SNMPAgent directive now supports this, e.g.:
 <IfModule mod\_snmp.c> SNMPAgent master 127.0.0.1:1161 10.0.1.2:1161 [::] </IfModule>
 See doc/contrib/mod\_snmp.html#SNMPAgent for more information.
 TLSOptions Small Diffie-Hellman groups are subject to cryptographic weaknesses; see https://weakdh.org. Thus mod\_tls now avoids the use of weak DH groups by default; the AllowWeakDH TLSOption is used to re-enable such support for clients that require it. See doc/contrib/mod\_tls.html#TLSOptions.
 + Changed Command Handling
 When handling the STAT FTP command, ProFTPD now follows RFC 959 more closely, and will use the 213 response code for STAT commands on files, and the 212 response code for STAT commands on directories. Previously, ProFTPD would respond to all STAT commands using the 211 response code.
 + Changed Utilities
 The ftpwho command-line utility can now emit its data as JSON, for easier parsing/reuse in other utilities. To request JSON, use:
 $ ftpwho -o json

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-848e410cfb
2019-10-28 01:38:47.888985
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.3.6b
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a cumulative bug-fix update from upstream, including a fix for a pre-
authentication remote denial of service issue.

| [@computersalat](https://github.com/computersalat) Hopefully it does, but you may need to build from source from the 1.3.6 branch until a release happens. I don't think the fix has been backported to 1.3.5 yet. |

| If I installed 1.3.6 when it was released via RPM, would that version be vulnerable as well? From what I can read on NVD it's only up to 1.3.5b? |

| [@benlarsendk](https://github.com/benlarsendk) 1.3.6 is vulnerable as well. You will need to either build a new RPM from the 1.3.6 branch (you can refer to `contrib/dist/travis/docker-rpmbuild.sh` for how to do this) or wait for your package maintainer to do so. |

| [@Castaglia](https://github.com/Castaglia) Today I built a Debian package using source code of 1.3.5e and noticed that the issue is still reproducible. At least I can still create a malicious.php as described in Bug 4372. Please double check. Thanks! |

Today I built a Debian package using source code of 1.3.5e and noticed that the issue is still reproducible. At least I can still create a malicious.php as described in Bug 4372. Please double check. Thanks! Some additional information: There were other issues related to mod\_copy, but CVE-2019-12815 is specific to the issue reported in <http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4372> . The reporters (Tobias MÃ¤del) blogpost about it is at <https://tbspace.de/cve201912815proftpd.html> . The CVE description should always be taken with a salt of grain. It might just reflect the information available at a given point in time or might reflect which versions were tested, but not mentioning further followup versions in a branch does not necessarly mean it was fixed after the mentioned version (unless it is clearly stated that the issue is fixed in version x.y). Sorry for the lengthly excurse, but I hope it is of benefit for all following this issue as there was some confusion on which are the fixed versions. At time of writing there is the fix commited but there is no upstream version which would contain already the fix. Hope this helps :) If the fix additionally to on top of the 1.3.6 series could be backported to the 1.3.5 series that would help downstreams shipping this version :) Actually for Debian stretch Hilmar Preusse did backport the changes, see <https://bugs.debian.org/932453> but in Debian we have not yet releases a so called DSA, because the version for 1.3.5 backport shows a strange behaviour. When trying to reproduce the issue, the connection just terminates (plugging effectively the issue, but for the 1.3.6 version it returns correctly a permission denied and connection remains intact). There might thus missed some prerequeisite commits for backports to the 1.3.5 series in e.g. the error handling or so. |

It wasn't a backport what I did. I simply adapted the patch we got in this pull request so it applies to the source tree and compilation runs OK. As said: I didn't even do functional testing. ;-( |

SSA-940889: Vulnerabilities in the embedded FTP server of SIMATIC
CP 1543-1

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2020-02-11
2020-02-11
V1.0

SUMMARY

The latest update for SIMATIC CP 1543-1 contains two ï¬xes for vulnerabilities within its embedded
ProFTPD FTP server. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution
and information disclosure without authentication.

Siemens has released updates for SIMATIC CP 1543-1 modules.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SIMATIC CP 1543-1 (incl. SIPLUS NET vari-
ants):
All Versions >= V2.0 and < V2.2

Update to V2.2
https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/
view/109775642

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiï¬ed the following speciï¬c workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

â¢ Disable the embedded FTP server. The server is deactivated in the default conï¬guration.

â¢ Limit access to port 21/tcp to trusted IP addresses.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conï¬gure the environment according to Siemensâ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SIMATIC CP 1543-1 communication processor connects the S7-1500 controller to Ethernet networks.
It provides integrated security functions such as ï¬rewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support
of other protocols with data encryption such as FTPs. The communication processor protects S7-1500
stations against unauthorized access, as well as integrity and conï¬dentiality of transmitted data.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ï¬rmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiï¬cation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ï¬rst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciï¬c to the customerâs
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deï¬ned by the customer to accomplish ï¬nal scoring.

An additional classiï¬cation has been performed using the CWE classiï¬cation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiï¬cation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-12815

An arbitrary ï¬le copy vulnerability in mod_copy of the embedded FTP server allowes for remote code
execution and information disclosure without authentication, a related issue to CVE-2015-3306.

CWE-284: Improper Access Control

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18217

The embedded FTP server allowes remote unauthenticated denial-of-service due to incorrect handling
of overly long commands because execution in a child process enters an inï¬nite loop.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-7559f29ace
2019-10-29 01:07:34.725333
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.3.6b
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a cumulative bug-fix update from upstream, including a fix for a pre-
authentication remote denial of service issue.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-ae019c7e9f
2019-10-28 01:54:12.463294
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 1.3.6b
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This is a cumulative bug-fix update from upstream, including a fix for a pre-
authentication remote denial of service issue.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them â but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Dear [@Castaglia](https://github.com/Castaglia) â

As discussed, please find below the description of the ProFTPD 1.3.6 denial-of-service issue.

#### Issue

Remote unauthenticated denial-of-service in ProFTPD 1.3.6, triggered by a malformed network packet due to an incorrect handling of too long commands.

#### Version

ProFTPD 1.3.6 - ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/source/proftpd-1.3.6.tar.gz

#### Description

An unauthenticated attacker can trigger an infinite loop by sending a malformed network packet due to an incorrect handling of too long commands. The issue in the network IO causes a child process that handles the client connection to consume 100% CPU.

If errno is 7 (E2BIG) due to a too long command and the EOF is reached, read() function will always return 0 and will be called indefinitely due to the continue statement:

```
src/main.c:
...
    if (cmd_buflen < 0) {
      if (errno == E2BIG) {
        /* The client sent a too-long command which was ignored; give
         * them another chance?
         */
        continue;
      }
...
```
#### Impact

Remote unauthenticated denial-of-service

Cheers

-Stephan Zeisberg
